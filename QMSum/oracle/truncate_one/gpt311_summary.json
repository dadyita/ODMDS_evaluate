        "During the meeting, several decisions were made regarding the DARPA project. It was decided that a mock-up of question answering would be created, separate from the transcriber interface. The team also discussed the need for more data and the potential to train noise models in the recognizer for transient sounds. It was agreed that the transcribers would continue their work, and more transcribers would be hired to maintain a lean staff size. \n\nThe team also discussed the paper they were working on. The paper focused on the amount of overlap in meetings and how it affects recognition performance. They found that meetings recorded with the Meeting Recorder had the most overlap, followed by Switchboard and CallHome, and the Robustness meetings had the least overlap. They also found that interruptions were more likely to occur after discourse markers, backchannels, and filled pauses. \n\nThe team decided to compare the already transcribed meetings with the beeps added to the original recordings to see if there were any major differences. They also discussed the need for time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech by each speaker. \n\nOverall, the team made progress on the DARPA project and the paper they were working on, and made decisions to move forward with their research."
