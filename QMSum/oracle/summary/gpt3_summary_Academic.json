    "During the meeting, there was a discussion about XML tools, data quality, and the current XML format for linking up different components in data. Various XML tools in different languages have been installed, such as Java and Perl, to extract information from XML files. However, the current XML format for transcripts lacks markers for the start and end of each utterance, making it difficult to use in other tools. There was a suggestion to improve the format by adding start and end markers, as well as implementing an indirect timeline feature.\n\nIn terms of data quality, additional transcribers have been hired and progress is being made. However, it will take another week to complete the double checking process. The first five EDU meetings have been processed and chunked up, with one already sent to IBM. The others will be sent once the first one is approved.\n\nThe CrossPad devices have been used in the past but haven't been used much recently. Some participants found the pen to be noisy. There was a discussion about the need for infrastructure to synchronize the time on the CrossPad with the recording time. It was suggested that using voice synchronization or other methods could be an alternative, but additional infrastructure would still be required to mark the synchronized points in the transcript.\n\nOpinions on the current XML format were provided by participants F and A. F expressed interest in using a PDA with a wireless card for synchronization and noted the convenience of buttons for note-taking. A suggested using a PDA with a wireless card as well, but also mentioned the possibility of using buttons for convenience. Both participants seemed open to using a different format, such as the one used by ATLAS, if it better suited their needs and had tools that others could use as well.\n\nOverall, the meeting provided insights into the current status of XML tools, data quality, and the use of CrossPad devices. Opinions were shared on the current XML format and potential improvements. The participants discussed the challenges of dealing with large files, the need for more compact formats, and the representation of multiple speakers in the XML format. They were open to exploring different options for XML tools and formats, considering factors such as ease of use, compatibility with existing tools, and the ability to share the format with others. They also discussed the efficiency of extracting information from the XML structure and the challenges of merging different annotations. The participants expressed the need for a format that can be easily extended and integrated with other tools and databases.",
