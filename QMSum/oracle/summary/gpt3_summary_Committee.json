    "During the meeting, there was a discussion on resource implications related to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Julie Morgan expressed the view that the Bill aims to protect children's rights by prohibiting all forms of physical punishment. She acknowledged that people have different views on this issue and emphasized the importance of hearing those views through the consultation process. Morgan also highlighted that any physical punishment of children is incompatible with their human rights according to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n\nIn terms of unforeseen costs, Julie Morgan explained that the legislation would not create a new offense but rather remove a defense to an offense of common assault. The implementation group is working on addressing issues related to implementation and resource implications. They have set up four work streams to address various aspects of the Bill, such as parenting advice and support, data collection and evaluation, operations and procedures, and out-of-court disposals and diversions.\n\nKaren Cornish added that the effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs), although they can be helpful in facilitating joint working between agencies. The implementation group is considering how agencies can work together in a consistent and appropriate way, and the effectiveness of MASH arrangements in Wales will be reviewed by a multi-agency strategic group.\n\nJulie Morgan recognized that social workers are already stretched and that their workload could potentially increase with the implementation of the Bill. However, she mentioned that there is no expectation of a significant rise in referrals to social services. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation will be important to assess the impact of the legislation and ensure that social services have the necessary support and resources.\n\nThe education sector is represented on the implementation group, and Julie Morgan stated that teachers already receive training on childcare legislation. The training related to the Bill could be incorporated into existing training programs, and the cost is expected to be minimal.\n\nOverall, the discussion highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation, the importance of collaboration between agencies, and the consideration of additional support and resources to ensure effective implementation of the Bill. The meeting also touched on the potential impact on social services, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the need for a public awareness campaign.",
    "During the meeting, the opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance of individual institutions were not directly discussed. However, Kirsty Williams AM did discuss the effectiveness of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 and the need for reform in the new legislation.

The meeting participants recognized the need for more capacity and resources to support these students effectively.\n\nLocal authorities have developed behavior and well-being strategies, including tiered approaches, to provide universal provision and more specialist support when needed. A multi-agency approach involving social care and health colleagues is seen as important for comprehensive support for students and their families.\n\nThe impact of school accountability measures on exclusions was discussed, with efforts being made to shift the focus from attainment measures to progression and well-being. The introduction of the new curriculum is seen as an opportunity to promote a broader range of measures.\n\nFunding challenges and their potential impact on exclusions were also mentioned. The funding issues faced by schools, particularly in relation to additional learning needs, can create additional pressures. The implementation of the new Additional Learning Needs Act may increase these pressures, emphasizing the need for adequate funding and resources.\n\nParental engagement is prioritized, with a team-around-the-family approach adopted by local authorities. Involving parents in decision-making and planning for their child's education is highlighted.\n\nConcerns were raised about the quality assurance of individual tuition and provision in EOTAS settings, particularly those delivered by independent providers. Robust systems and monitoring are needed to ensure appropriate support and safeguarding.\n\nCollaboration between schools, PRUs, and local authorities is crucial for the challenges of the current curriculum and transition to the new curriculum. Greater capacity and specialized training for staff in EOTAS settings are needed.\n\nAccess to mental health support for EOTAS learners and the challenges in meeting their needs were discussed. Variations in access to mental health services and the need for greater capacity and resources were emphasized.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the complex challenges and issues related to exclusions and support for learners with additional needs. The importance of collaboration, adequate funding, and support for mental health were emphasized. The specific opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance were not discussed.",
    "During the meeting, the key points discussed regarding the profitability, situation, reports, and government policy on long-term care for seniors were as follows:\n\n1. The government's priority is to invest in long-term care for seniors and ensure that they receive proper care and support.\n2.

    "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector include the impact of Brexit, funding position, student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure, and uncertainty about the fees and funding review. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has affected areas such as EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding. The funding position is a major pressure, with Welsh institutions being approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England due to pre-existing funding gaps. Student recruitment is also a challenge, with changes in student support arrangements for EU students and increased competition from English institutions. Pay and pension costs, as well as the expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure, add financial pressures to the sector. Uncertainty about the fees and funding review in England, known as the Augar review, also contributes to the financial challenges faced by Welsh higher education institutions.\n\nTo address these challenges, the sector is focusing on promoting Wales as an attractive place to study, increasing marketing efforts, and strengthening partnerships with the Welsh and UK governments. They are also seeking additional sources of funding, such as research funding from the charitable sector, and advocating for continued access to EU funding programs. The sector is working on contingency plans and scenarios to ensure financial sustainability and protect student interests. However, their ability to address these challenges depends on the clarity and stability of the political and funding landscape.",
    "Dr. David Blaney, the chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, discussed the impact of Brexit on the higher education system in Wales. He highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the relationship between the UK and the EU as one of the most significant issues facing universities in Wales. He emphasized the importance of EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding for the Welsh higher education sector.\n\nDr. Blaney noted that there has been a decrease in EU students applying to study in Wales, as well as a decrease in non-EU international students. He attributed this to changes in student support arrangements for EU students and the relative investment levels between Wales and England.\n\nThe Welsh higher education sector is facing pressures related to funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and the uncertainty surrounding the Augar review of fees and funding in England. Dr. Blaney stated that the sector is preparing for various scenarios and highlighted the need for increased capital investment to enhance competitiveness.\n\nBrexit also has the potential to impact fee and access plans, as well as the need for continued collaboration and funding from research councils and the charitable sector. Dr. Blaney stressed the importance of maintaining the quality and impact of research in Wales and the need for clarity and support from the Welsh Government.\n\nOverall, Dr. Blaney expressed concern about the potential challenges and uncertainties that Brexit may bring to the Welsh higher education system.

    "During a meeting, the discussion focused on the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them, as well as Julie Morgan's perspective. The Welsh Government is working on pilot projects in eight local authorities to find ways to simplify and join up the complex early childhood education and care system. They are also planning to make an announcement soon regarding the direction they want to take. The Welsh Government recognizes the need for greater consistency in early childhood education and care provision across Wales and is working to develop a more integrated approach. They are also working to support the Welsh language skills of the childcare and play workforce. The evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer showed limited impact due to limited availability, and the second evaluation is expected to provide more meaningful results. The Welsh Government plans to extend the offer to parents in education and training and is reviewing the program to determine how to include them. The decision to move away from HMRC was based on the desire for a more flexible approach and the ability to expand the childcare offer beyond what HMRC would allow. Technical issues with HMRC's IT systems and their ability to comply with Welsh language standards also influenced the decision. The cost of moving to a child-centred approach for the childcare offer is still being determined, but approximately 34,000 children are currently eligible based on the current eligibility criteria. There is a review looking at the possibility of a universal offer. The Parent, Childcare and Employment Programme (PaCE) has been extended until June 2022 with additional funding, but there is uncertainty about funding beyond that date. Flying Start currently reaches about 23% of children in Wales, and an estimated 45% of children in Flying Start areas are in poverty. The committee raised concerns about the take-up of the childcare offer in certain areas and the low percentage of parents attending parenting courses. The reasons for the drop in take-up and plans to encourage participation will be discussed further. The committee also expressed concerns about children who are still falling behind despite the support provided by Flying Start, and longitudinal studies are being conducted to track progress and evaluate the program.",
