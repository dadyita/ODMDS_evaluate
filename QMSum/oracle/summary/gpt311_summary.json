    "During the meeting, a decision was made to have the system ready for the DARPA meeting in mid-July. The team discussed the progress on the transcription interface and the need for a mock-up of a question answering system. They also discussed the need for more transcribers and the organization of the meeting data.\n\nThe paper discussed the amount of overlap in different corpora, including the Meeting Recorder meetings, the Robustness meetings, Switchboard, and CallHome. It included statistics on the number of overlapping words and spurts of speech in each corpus. The findings showed that the Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap, followed by Switchboard and CallHome, while the Robustness meetings had the least amount of overlap. It was also noted that two-party telephone conversations had similar levels of overlap as face-to-face meetings.\n\nIn terms of transcription, the decision was made to send the EDU meetings to IBM for transcription. The focus would be on the dominant speakers and excluding background laptop sounds. Transcribers would mark the start and end points of the dominant speakers and note any misclassification of speech as nonspeech. The aim was to generate a flood of data that could be useful when it comes back from IBM. It was suggested that a sample of the meetings should be listened to before sending them to IBM to ensure the accuracy of the speech-nonspeech detection. Statistics from previous meetings indicated that the speech-nonspeech detector had an error rate of around 1% for good meetings, potentially higher for meetings with more background noise. The paper discussed the results of the detection system and the impact of overlaps on recognition performance.\n\nIn summary, the decision made on DARPA was to have the system ready for the mid-July meeting. The paper focused on the amount of overlap in different corpora and included statistics on overlapping words and spurts of speech. The Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap, followed by Switchboard and CallHome, while the Robustness meetings had the least overlap. The decision was made to send the EDU meetings to IBM for transcription, with a focus on dominant speakers and excluding background laptop sounds. The paper discussed the results of the speech-nonspeech detection system and its impact on recognition performance.",
