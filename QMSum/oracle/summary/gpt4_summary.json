  "The Industrial Designer and the Project Manager had a lot of thoughts and discussions during the meeting. The Industrial Designer expressed his thoughts about the design aspects of the project. He mentioned the idea of having a single curve design for the feel of the product and suggested using rubber for a spongy feel. He also talked about the challenges of getting the labelling on the individual buttons right. He brought up the idea of having different colours for different buttons to differentiate them. He also discussed the idea of having a slide-away feature in the design.\n\nThe Project Manager, on the other hand, focused more on the financial and logistical aspects of the project. He talked about the target selling price of twenty-five Euro for the remote control, which would generate a profit of fifty million Euros. He also discussed the specifics of the product, asking whether it was a stand-alone unit or a universal one. He emphasized the importance of meeting the budget requirements and suggested ways to cut costs without compromising the product's quality.\n\nThe Project Manager also led the discussions about the evaluation criteria for the prototype. He talked about the importance of the product's appearance and technical innovation. He also suggested that the product should be a recognisable reaction product, aligning with the corporate image.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the Project Manager drew several conclusions. He noted the team's preference for a sleek, modern design with innovative features. He also noted the team's agreement on having a single curve design and using rubber for a spongy feel. The Project Manager also concluded that the team was willing to adjust the design to fit the budget requirements, such as changing the case to plastic and reducing the special colours. He concluded that the team was committed to delivering a product that was within budget, technically innovative, and aesthetically pleasing.",

  "The disagreement between the User Interface and Industrial Designer regarding the price during the interactive evaluation was due to the cost associated with the technology and materials used for the product. The User Interface suggested a price that took into account the cost of programming the menus and the fact that the device only has four buttons, which means everything depending on what menu you're in. The Industrial Designer, however, felt that the components used were simple and robust, implying that they might be cheaper than the User Interface was suggesting. The User Interface suggested a slightly higher price because of the need for someone with programming skills to handle the menus, which could be a considerable expense.\n\nThe User Interface disagreed on the redesign after product evaluation because of concerns that if the first generation of the product failed due to overlooked design flaws, there might not be a second generation for redesign. The User Interface believed that feedback from users should be taken into account before the product is launched, to avoid potential failures that could jeopardize the product's future.\n\nThe User Interface suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance because these are the company's colors. This was suggested with the idea that aligning the product's colors with the company's colors would help to promote brand recognition and consistency.\n\nThe disagreement between the Marketing team and the User Interface designer on the shape of the product during the discussion of product appearance was due to differing perceptions of what would appeal to the market. The User Interface designer suggested a banana shape for the product, considering it to be ergonomic and easy to hold, while also standing out due to its unique shape. However, the Marketing team felt that an abstract shape would be more appealing, as it would be different and not immediately recognizable as a banana, allowing for more room for interpretation and personal preference.",
  "The group's discussions regarding technical issues began with the debate over the energy source for the remote control. Different options such as batteries, hand dynamo, kinetic energy, and solar cells were considered. Batteries were chosen as the simplest and most efficient solution. \n\nDuring the project announcement email discussion, the group decided on the roles and responsibilities of each member. The industrial designer was tasked with working on the actual design, the user interface was to focus on the technical functions, and the marketing executive was to think about the product's requirements. The group also discussed the project's financial aspects, including the selling price of the remote control and its production cost.\n\nIn terms of the sample sensor, the group discussed the option of including a speaker in the remote control. However, they concluded that it would be the most expensive part of the remote without offering any interesting functionality. They also discussed the idea of voice recognition, but decided it was not suitable for their product.\n\nRegarding the design, the group decided on a rubber double-curved case with rubber push-buttons. This design was considered to be user-friendly, potentially reducing the risk of repetitive strain injury (R.S.I.) due to the rubber material's flexibility. They also decided to go for simple buttons rather than an LCD display or a spinning wheel, as these were deemed unnecessary and potentially more expensive.\n\nThe group also discussed the possibility of using Bluetooth technology in the remote control, but they eventually decided against it because it would require the television to be Bluetooth-compatible, which is not a common feature in televisions. \n\nOverall, the group focused on creating a functional, affordable, and user-friendly remote control that would stand out in the market due to its unique design and material.",
  "The team's proposed design for the product, a remote control, is centered on functionality, user-friendliness, and marketability. According to the User Interface Designer, the design incorporates basic TV functions, a locator feature, a scroll wheel for channel selection, and a revolutionary zapping feature for favorite channels. The design also includes a cradle unit and a rubber covering for durability. However, potential issues such as the scroll wheel possibly rotating upon impact were also discussed. \n\nThe Industrial Designer and Marketing agreed on the physical appearance of the product. They suggested a color scheme of silvers and blacks to match most televisions and a design that is simple, intuitive, and attractive. The design features a single-curved, ergonomic shape with an easy-to-use scroll wheel and comfortable buttons. The Industrial Designer also proposed including a trigger button in the final design phase.\n\nAs for the marketing plan, the Industrial Designer suggested a fashionable product that people immediately recognize and want to own, much like the appeal of the iPod. The goal is to create a product that looks cool and is desirable regardless of its functionality. \n\nFrom the marketing perspective, the product was viewed as having several marketable features. These included the base station with a \"where's my remote\" button and the potential for the product to be upgradable. The marketing representative believed that the unique combination of these features would make the product competitive, proposing a selling price between 30 to 50 Euros. The marketing rep also suggested the possibility of offering a lifetime normal use guarantee, which would provide a replacement at no cost if the product had a technical problem. They also mentioned the product's potential for exclusivity rather than mass market appeal. \n\nHowever, the team agreed that additional discussions and planning were necessary to finalize the design and marketing strategies. The Industrial Designer promised to provide a detailed plan in writing within two weeks, which would include the functional and technical design, team requirements, timeframe, initial budget, marketing strategies, and competitive analysis.",
  "The meeting discussed the upcoming DARPA meeting scheduled for mid-July. The team recognized the importance of being prepared for this meeting and having significant progress to show. There was a discussion about a demo involving the transcriber interface and potentially a mock-up for question answering. The team also expressed a desire to have entered into production mode by the time of the DARPA meeting, implying that they hope to have a working, efficient system in place.\n\nThe team is currently working on a paper, and while the specific contents are not detailed extensively in the meeting, it is mentioned that the paper will include an analysis of patterns found in the data and the use of classifiers. The paper will also discuss the prosodic features of the data and how they show up in these classifiers. \n\nIn terms of statistics, as of the meeting date, the team had collected a total of sixty-two hours of meeting data. This information was organized into a spreadsheet detailing the start time, date, old and new meeting names, the number of speakers, duration of the meeting, transcription status, and any additional comments. This spreadsheet was to be exported as HTML and uploaded to the Meeting Recorder web page to keep people updated on the project's status. The goal was to have a significant amount of the collected data transcribed by the DARPA meeting, although the exact amount transcribed by the time of this meeting was not specified.",
  "The team's evaluation of the entire production process revealed several likes and dislikes. \n\nStarting with the likes, the team appreciated the creative freedom they had, despite the restriction to designing a TV remote. They enjoyed the autonomy to determine how technologically advanced and fashionable the product should be, reflecting the company's ethos as a fashion-forward technology enterprise. They found the prototype creation process enjoyable and appreciated the opportunity to incorporate their individual ideas into the design. \n\nThe team also valued the technology they had at their disposal, like digital pens and wireless laptops, which facilitated their work. They also mentioned the advantage of a shared network where they could collate all their work. The team found new ideas throughout the process and expressed excitement about the potential marketability of their product.\n\nOn the other hand, there were aspects of the production process that the team did not appreciate as much. They felt their creativity was somewhat stifled by the company's restriction to only use a TV remote. The team also expressed some discontent with the survey process, finding it irritating at times. \n\nThere was an issue with the fact that the remote was designed to control only the TV, which the team thought could limit its appeal to potential buyers. They also had some reservations about the prototype's aesthetics, particularly the user interface, which found it challenging to incorporate a cover with a cherry fruit design. \n\nIn terms of individual components of the remote, there was a debate about whether to use a lithium battery or AAA batteries, with the final decision leaning towards the former due to the anticipated technological savviness of potential users. The voice sensor feature was also a point of discussion, with the team ultimately deciding to include it.\n\nOverall, the team seemed to be satisfied with the process, despite the mentioned dislikes, and saw potential in their product. They expressed confidence that their model could be successful and sell millions, even though some adjustments might be needed, such as the potential addition of extra interfaces depending on the button placement.",
  "The professor expressed a few key thoughts on the back-end and data storage in the meeting. Firstly, he suggested that if they were recording the sessions anyway for their own purposes, they should save all the data as long as they have the disk space. This is because anyone training up an experiment could choose to include or exclude this data, so it's better to have it and give them the option.\n\nIn the discussion about the SmartKom data, the professor stated his belief that they should save all the data, even though the SmartKom sessions were different from their usual meetings. He felt that the criteria of two or more people conversing was key, and the data could be useful for future experiments.\n\nHowever, when it came to organizing the data, the professor suggested that the SmartKom data should be stored separately from the rest of the meeting corpus. He thought that it was different enough (being scenario-based and human-computer interface) to warrant its own space, despite it potentially being included in future experiments.\n\nFinally, in reference to storing digit reading data, the professor stated that he wouldn't categorize it as 'meetings', even though it was stored under the same directory tree. He seemed to favor the idea of having distinct directories for different types of data, to avoid potential confusion and to maintain clarity in data organization.",
  "During the meeting, Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements regarding future product ideas, particularly around the use of kinetic energy and the decision to make the product upgradable. These disagreements emerged from their different perspectives on product design, cost, and user experience.\n\nThe concept of using kinetic energy as a power source for the remote control was discussed. The idea was that the user could simply shake the remote to generate energy, similar to how kinetic watches work. However, the Industrial Designer raised concerns about the practicality of this feature, believing that elderly users, who are the primary target market, may not appreciate the need to shake their remote for it to function. On the other hand, Marketing viewed the kinetic energy concept as an innovative feature that could potentially attract users who desire something exclusive and unique.\n\nThe idea of making the product upgradable was also a point of contention. Marketing suggested the possibility of making the remote control upgradable, potentially increasing its longevity and appeal to consumers. However, the Industrial Designer, along with the User Interface and Project Manager, expressed concerns about complicating the product's design and usability. They felt that adding more buttons or features for upgradeability could make the remote less straightforward and simple to use, which could be a deterrent for their primary target market \u2013 the elderly population.\n\nMoreover, these disagreements also reflected differing views on cost considerations. Marketing was interested in features that could increase the product's market appeal and potentially its price point, while the Industrial Designer was more focused on practicality, user interface, and keeping the design within production cost boundaries. They had to consider the balance between adding advanced features and maintaining a reasonable production cost that aligns with the estimated unit price of fifteen point eight Euros. \n\nOverall, these disagreements highlighted the challenges of product development that need to balance innovation, user experience, and cost-effectiveness.",
  "The meeting did not provide specific information on Kirsty Williams' thoughts on the funding allocated to the consortia or her reaction to concerns regarding university governance. There was also no mention of Kirsty Williams' response to university mergers during the meeting. \n\nAs for the discussion around admission problems in Welsh universities, Kirsty Williams noted that the full picture of student recruitment will not be clear until the next academic year. She mentioned that the change in government policy regarding student support, which no longer allows European students to benefit from a tuition fee grant, has likely impacted EU recruitment. However, she expressed confidence that Welsh universities can continue to attract international students given the right course offerings, high-quality teaching, and attractive infrastructure. \n\nIn terms of proposed solutions, Williams mentioned that the Welsh Government is working with Universities Wales to increase their ability to market higher education internationally through the Global Wales initiative. The government has allocated \u00a33.5 million to this initiative, which is specifically targeting and beefing up international recruitment work. The government is also in ongoing negotiations with Universities Wales about the expected outcomes from this investment. \n\nAdditionally, Kirsty Williams mentioned that the government has made an additional resource of \u00a35 million available to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees and to kick-start work on postgraduate support. \n\nIn terms of Brexit, Williams stressed the need for a deal with the EU and mentioned that they have made a guarantee for EU student support for the next academic year, but without further guarantees from the Treasury, she did not feel it would be prudent to commit the Welsh Government to anything further. Williams also talked about the Welsh Government's close working relationship with the National Union of Students and the consensus between the Government, institutions, and students on the importance of participation in schemes like Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020. \n\nOn the topic of immigration, Williams stated that they continue to lobby the UK government for an immigration system that makes it as easy as possible for students who want to benefit from education in Wales and the UK to do so. She also mentioned that the Welsh Government does not believe that international students should be included in immigration targets."
