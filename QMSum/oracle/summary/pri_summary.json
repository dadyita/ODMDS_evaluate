    "The group discussed the importance of user and situation models, with grad e stating that it was important for the user to be able to make decisions based on their own preferences, while professor b emphasized that the user should not be forced to choose between the user and the situation model. The group agreed that it would be beneficial to have the user choose between two different options, with the user deciding whether they want to go to the castle or not and the user choosing between the two options. They also discussed the need for a user-friendly interface, which would allow them to interact with each other without having to deal with a host of different people. The user would have to decide whether they wanted to go or not, and they would need to decide if they were going to spend money or not. They would also need to determine whether they would like to spend more money or less money, as well as deciding whether or not they should spend money on food and whether they should go to a hotel or not. grad e: OK, and so this, oh that grad d: The other thing is that every time that's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it '\u2019s updated or only when we need to? professor b: Yeah, that ''s a good question.. grad a: because, you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time. So here's what's permissible is that you can arrange so that the the value of that is gonna to be updated and n it ''s not a belief update, right? It's you took some actions, you spent money and stuff, so the update of that are going to be essentially external to the belief - net. And if it does influence anything then you ''re gonna need something that converts from the the number here to something that's relevant to the decision there. So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things.",
    "The first petition is from a group of citizens who are concerned about the government's lack of action on the COVID-19 pandemic. They are calling on the government to enact a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and of similar bills in previous parliaments and would like to see us pass that bill as soon as possible. These residents have signed a petition asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to put a high priority on assisting our poorest seniors. The increases to the GIS by $200, and $300 to the OAS, have been well received. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. Six thousand people have already signed the first version of this petition, launched last month by musician JordanOfficer and supported by singer BarbaraSecours. As an artist, I am proud to present this petition today because the issues it raises are fundamental to the survival of Quebec culture. garnett genuis (sherwood parkfort saskatchewan, cpc): Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out. I think of Daniel Lauzon who set up Food for Now, a mobile service that helps take care of the homeless. I Think of Toni Varone, who helped his business clients by forgiving their rents, or young Lucas, who wanted to thank his teachers. I want to thank their teachers.",
    "The industrial designer suggested that the remote control should be shaped like a tiger, and the user should be able to use it to control the TV, while the user interface suggested that it should be easy to use, as it would be easier for the user to use than a remote control. The industrial designer proposed that the design of the remote should be based on the shape of the animal, and that the shape should be symmetrical. The user interface proposed a simple design, but the project manager suggested a more complex design, with a lot of buttons and buttons on the front and back, as well as a button on the right side of the screen, and a button in the middle for the volume. The project manager also suggested that there should be a button at the top of the device, so that the user could simply press it to turn on the TV and it would turn on and off. The Industrial Designer proposed that it be made of plastic, and it should not be too heavy or heavy, as the user would have to hold it in their hands. The User Interface team proposed a design for the remote, which was based on a picture of a tiger with a tiger on it, and they decided to make it look like it was wearing a tiger costume. The Project Manager suggested that they design the remote to look like a dolphin, but they wanted it to be a little different from the other remote controls, as they wanted to create a unique design.",
    ", and, the other thing, which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit, which is that, one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain with, Manolo Pardo and Javier, Ferreiros, who was here before, was, why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries. professor g: But, on the other hand I saw that the they had a good point that, if we had something that worked for many cases before, maybe starting from there a bit Because ultimately we're gonna end up with some s su kind of structure like that, phd d: Yeah. postdoc f: And so I did two mixtures, one for the loud speakers and one for a quiet speaker, and then I had to hand - label who was loud and who was quiet, and I did that for five minutes of one dialogue, because I thought it would be easier for the transcribers to understand what was going on.",
    "The team discussed the design of the remote control, with the user interface designer suggesting that the design should be based on the market trends of the day, such as fruit and vegetables, while the industrial designer suggested the use of rubber as a material for the buttons, and the project manager suggested using rubber for the power button and a rubber case for the volume button. The team also discussed the need for a unique design for the remote, with a design that would be unique to the market. The industrial designer proposed the idea of a banana-shaped remote control with a double-curved shape, which was met with skepticism by the marketing team, who believed that it would be too hard to make a remote control that looked like a banana with a banana shaped shape. The project manager agreed with the team that a banana would be a good choice, as it would look like a fruit and would be easy to hold in the hand. The user interface team also suggested that the remote should be shaped like the shape of a fruit, and that it should have a circular shape, similar to a banana shape. They also suggested the addition of a button on the right side of the screen, which would allow users to control the remote with their hands, as well as a button for the microphone, which could be placed on the left side. The marketing team suggested the inclusion of a microphone on the front of the device, as this would be easier for users to reach and easier for them to reach. The group discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker into the remote and the idea was discussed, but the team decided against it, as they believed that a speaker would be difficult to find in the market due to its size and cost.",
    "Hefin david am: What are the challenges that you're seeing in the early implementation of the childcare offer? huw irranca-davies am: Well, there are a lot of challenges that we're having to deal with, and we're trying to address them, but I think we're going to be able to do it by the end of the year, and I think it's important that we do it in a way that meets the needs of the families and meets the demands of the children. Hefin David am: So, for example, there is a need for more support for parents, and there's a need to ensure that they have the support they need, so that they don't miss out on their child's education, and that they're not left out of their education. He Fin David am asked about the cost of childcare, and Huw explains that it is currently being funded by the Welsh government, and the government is working with local authorities to find out whether they can afford it, and if not, how much they can pay for it.",
    "The Project Manager and User Interface presented a concept for a remote control with a banana-shaped remote control, which was designed to look like a banana, and the Industrial Designer suggested incorporating a banana into the remote control. The Project Manager suggested using a banana as the base for the remote, as it would be easier to hold and easier to use, as well as having a unique look and feel. However, the Project Manager expressed concerns about the cost of the device due to the lack of an LCD screen and the need for a large number of buttons. The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of having a simple design, and suggested that the remote should be easy to use and easy to hold, with a simple shape and minimal buttons. User Interface agreed with this idea, but the project manager emphasized that the device should be simple and simple, with only a few buttons and a small amount of buttons, and that it should not be too complicated to use. The project manager also suggested using an LCD for the buttons, as they could be placed on the side of the remote to make it easier to reach, and they also suggested incorporating an LCD into the buttons to make the remote more ergonomic. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition feature into the device, with the User Interface suggesting the use of a speech recognition feature, which would allow the user to control the remote with their voice. The User Interface proposed the idea of using the remote as a speaker for the voice recognition, but they were not sure about the feasibility of incorporating it into the product due to cost constraints. They decided to incorporate it in the product as a part of the marketing report, as there was no need for it to cost more than twenty-five Euros.",
    "Phd c: I think it would be a good idea for the team to have a group of people in the room to talk to each other, so that they have a good understanding of what they're talking about and what they want to talk about, and then they can share their findings with the rest of the team in the future. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating video into the recordings, with Phd A noting that the team would like to incorporate video into their recordings, as it would allow them to be more efficient in their work. Phd E also expressed interest in the idea of incorporating speech recognition into their work, with the goal of being able to use the speech recognition to analyze the speech and analyze the audio, and the team agreed to incorporate it into their research. The group discussed the importance of incorporating audio recognition into the team's work, as well as the need for a new type of microphone, which was discussed by Phd C, who suggested using a different type of mike that could be used for both speech and non-speech purposes. Additionally, the team discussed the feasibility of using different types of mikes for different purposes, such as speech recognition and speech recognition, and discussed the potential for using different mikes in different situations, with a focus on the use of different microphones for different kinds of speech.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the feasibility of using the drawing board for the remote control, with the industrial designer suggesting that it would be a good idea to use it as a reference point for the design, and the project manager agreed to incorporate it into the design of the product. They also discussed the possibility of making it into a remote control that could be used in a variety of scenarios, such as a phone or a TV remote control. The project manager suggested that the design should be based on the user's preference, and that it should be able to adapt to the needs of a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. The industrial designer proposed that the remote should be shaped like a fruit, with a handle on the left side and a button on the right side, but the team agreed that it was possible to make it look like a normal remote control with a rubber cover. The team discussed the need for a different type of remote control for each user, and they decided to go with the idea of using rubber instead of plastic, as it was easier to use and less expensive. The marketing team also suggested using a rubber case to hold the remote in place, while the user interface suggested using rubber for the buttons, as they could be easily accessible from the front of the remote. The user interface proposed using a plastic case for the case, but they were met with resistance from the marketing team, who pointed out that it could be difficult to use due to the size of the case and the cost of materials. The Industrial Designer suggested using plastic instead of rubber, which was met with skepticism by the Industrial Designer, who believed that the cost would be prohibitive. The Project Manager agreed, but agreed to use plastic as a replacement for the rubber case. The User Interface team agreed to the use of rubber as a material for the cover, as the rubber material would be more durable than plastic and would be easier to work with.",
    "The Industrial Designer and the Project Manager discussed the various aspects of the project, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that the project manager focus on the design of the remote control, while the User Interface suggested that it should be based on the concept of a remote control with a simple design, and that the user interface should be able to customize it to their personal preferences. The Project Manager suggested that the industrial designer should design the remote to be shaped like a red apple, with a red button on the left side and a white button in the middle, and the user should choose between a red and a blue button on top and a black one on the right side. The Industrial Designer suggested that there should be two buttons on the front, one on each side of the device, and a third on the back. The User Interface proposed that the remote should have a different color for each button, with red on the top, blue on the bottom, and white on the sides. The project manager agreed with this idea, and suggested that they should have two buttons for each channel, as well as a special button for the volume, as it would be easier for the user to control the volume. The industrial designer suggested the idea of having two buttons, as they would make it easier for people to switch between channels, and they would also be easier to find the right buttons for different channels. The user interface proposed that there be two different sizes for the buttons, one for the red button and another for the blue button, and it was decided that the price should be between twenty-five Euros and thirty Euros. The team discussed the feasibility of the design and the cost of the product, which was decided to be between fifteen Euros and forty Euros, based on a cost-benefit analysis. Marketing suggested a price of fifty Euros for the remote, which would be in the range of fifteen Euros to twenty-three Euros, but the team agreed that the cost would be less than fifty Euros, as long as it was not too expensive.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer agreed that the remote should be simple, simple, and stylish, with a simple design, and they agreed on the idea of using rubber for the buttons, with the idea that the buttons should be round, and that they would be able to be shaped to fit into the shape of the user's hand. They also agreed that they should have a small button on the right-hand side of the remote, as it would be easier for the user to reach and easier to reach. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a power button into the remote control, and the project manager suggested that the power button could be placed in the middle of the device, similar to an old-fashioned telephone, to make it easier for users to reach it. The project manager also suggested that it could be used to turn on the remote by pressing a button, but the industrial designer expressed concern about the cost of the product, stating that it would take a lot of time and money to produce the remote. However, the team agreed that it was important for the product to be technologically innovative, as well as stylish. The industrial designer emphasized the importance of being able to control the remote with the touch of a button and the need for a simple and stylish design. The idea was to create a simple remote with a basic design, with buttons on the left and right sides, and a small power button in the center, and an integrated circuit on the top, which would allow users to control it with their hands. The group agreed that this would be the best way to achieve the desired result, as the remote would be easy to use and easy to understand, and there would be no need for buttons to be hard to find.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the design of the remote, with the project manager stating that they would like to use a spongy material for the front of the device, and the industrial designer stating that it would be easier for the user to use the remote without having to hold it in their hands. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker on the front, as well as a microphone and a speaker for the microphone, which would be placed in the center of the screen. The project manager suggested that the microphone should be placed on the back of the TV, as it is easier for users to reach and easier for them to reach. The industrial designer suggested the idea of placing the microphone in the middle of the display, but the idea was rejected by the marketing team, who suggested placing it on the left side of the television. The team agreed that the front should be made of plastic, and they would have to find a material that would be easy to handle and easy to use. The marketing team suggested the use of a plastic material, as they believed it would make the remote easier to use and more durable. The group agreed that it was a good idea to incorporate a speaker into the remote and incorporate a microphone, but they were not sure about the cost of the speaker, as there was no guarantee that it wouldn't cost too much money. They decided to go with a plastic screen, as the cost would be less than the price of a traditional speaker, and it would allow them to make the product more affordable. The user interface team proposed the addition of a microphone to the remote's front, which was agreed upon by the team, but it was decided that it should not be too expensive, as long as it didn't cost more than $20. The Project Manager agreed to the idea, as he felt that the price would be too high for a device of this size. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer that the remote should be simple and simple, with a simple design, but not too complicated. The Industrial Designer suggested the inclusion of a speaker and a microphone on the right side, while the Project Manager disagreed, stating that a speaker would be more expensive than a microphone. However, the User Interface Team agreed that a microphone would be a good addition to the device as it would reduce the cost and increase the user-friendliness of the product. The Marketing team agreed to include a speaker in the remote as well, although they did not agree on the placement of the microphone due to the cost.",
    "The Project Manager and Industrial Designer discussed the concept of the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting the idea of a remote control that could be placed on a surfboard, while the User Interface suggested that it could be used for surfing or surfing, and the Project Manager suggested that the user interface should be able to change the shape of the L_C_D_ depending on the user's preference. The Industrial Designer suggested the use of a special shape for the remote, as it would be easier for the user to use it. The Project Manager proposed that the remote should be shaped like a surf board, and that the design should be based on the design of the surfing board. The User Interface proposed the addition of a microphone to the front of the device, which would allow users to speak to the remote by pressing a button on the remote. User Interface also suggested the inclusion of a voice button, which was agreed upon by Industrial Designer, User Interface, and Project Manager. The project manager proposed the introduction of a simple remote control with a simple design, but the industrial designer argued that it would not be practical, as the remote would be too bulky and would be difficult to hold in one hand. The user interface proposed the idea that the device should be designed in the style of a surfing board, with buttons on the front and back, and they agreed that it was a good idea to incorporate a microphone into the design. The industrial designer suggested the idea to include a microphone in the design, which the project manager agreed to, as long as it was not too expensive. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker in the front, but they decided against it, as they believed that the cost of the speaker would exceed the budget of twelve Euros. They decided to focus on a single-functionality remote control instead, as this would be the most cost-effective option for the consumer. The idea of using the remote for surfing was proposed by the Industrial Design team, and it was agreed that the idea would be incorporated into the product in the form of a small remote control for surfing. user interface: And then w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro marketing: project manager: and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik quite fixed on twenty five Euros industrial designer: so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer he can have for twenty five Euro.",
    "Phd d: I think it would be a good idea to look at the distribution of the energy between the two speakers, and I think that it would make sense to have two people speaking at the same time, because it's easier for them to understand each other. professor c: Yeah, but I don't know if it's possible to do that, because there are a lot of people in the room and it's hard to know what they're talking about, but if they're speaking to each other, they'll be able to hear each other more easily. phd e: Yeah, I think there's a lot to be gained from this, but I think we'll have to wait until we have more data before deciding whether or not it's worth investing in it. We'll see if there are any differences between the different people, but it's likely that there won't be any significant differences, and if there is, it'll be hard to distinguish between them. We also discussed the possibility of using different normalizations for different degrees of variance, with the idea of using a standard deviation as a proxy for the standard deviation, but the idea was quickly dismissed by Phd A, who pointed out that this would be difficult to do because there would be too many variables to account for, and it would take too long to analyze them all. However, Phd C agreed that there was no need to worry about this, as long as it was not too complicated. Phd D agreed that it wasn't too complicated, as there were only a handful of variables that could be used to analyze the data, and they could be combined into a single data set.",
    "Phd b: So, for example, if I were to use a twelve second window, I would have to wait until I had two seconds to train the system, but if I had four seconds, then I would only have to use two seconds, and if I only had six seconds, I could use four seconds. But if I trained the system for a longer period of time, I wouldn't have to worry about having to wait for two seconds because I would still have enough time to complete the task, and I would be able to see the results. professor c: Yeah, I think it would be interesting to see if there is a difference in performance between two seconds and four seconds in terms of the amount of time it takes for the system to calculate the mean, or if there are any differences in the number of seconds between two and six seconds. Phd A: I don't think there is any difference between the two, but I think there could be a difference between two to four seconds depending on the time of day and whether or not the system is being used or not. But, if you do that, then, in practice somebody using the SmartKom system, one would think if they're using it for a while, it means that their first utterance, instead of, you know, getting, a forty percent error rate reduction, they 'll get a, over what, you'd get without this, policy, you get thirty percent. But this is, w where, even if I train on the, model, and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test, it the word error rate is around, ten percent or nine percent. professor C: But it but looking at it the other way, isn't it what you're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training, if you were going to have a short time for grad e: That that's true.. But if you did first pass with, the with either without the mean sub subtraction or with a a very short time one, and then, once you, actually had the whole utterance in, if did, the, longer time version then, based on everything that you had, and then at that point only used it to distinguish between,, possible utterances or something, you you might it might not take very much time., I know in the large vocabulary stu, systems, people were evaluating on in the past, some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass but other people didn't and had multiple passes.",

User Interface: Okay, so we're going to have to take a look at the cost of the case, but we have a lot of money to spend on the product, and we want to make sure that we have enough money to cover the costs of the product. Industrial designer: I think it's going to cost a lot, but I think we can afford it, and I think that it's a good idea to do it, because it's not too expensive. marketing: Yeah, I agree with you, but it's gonna cost a little bit more than we originally thought, but there's no reason why it shouldn't be a lot more expensive than it should be, because we have to pay for the materials and the materials, and then we'll have to find a way to make it more affordable. Industrial Designer: We have to be careful about the price, but if it's too expensive, we'll just have to buy a different material, but the price will be less than the price of the original model. Marketing: Okay, but we're not sure if we should have a price of twenty-five Euro for the remote, because the price would be too high, and it would be more expensive if we had a price tag of fifty Euro, but that's okay, it's okay if we have more than fifty Euro.

    "The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HFCW), led by Dr. David Blaney, has identified the impact of Brexit on Wales' higher education system, including the drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, as well as the reduction in the number of applications from EU students. However, Dr. Blaney believes that there is a need for the HFCW to work closely with universities in Wales to ensure a smooth transition to a post-Brexit future, with the aim of ensuring a smooth and sustainable future for Welsh students. He also highlighted the importance of maintaining a strong relationship with the University of Wales, and the need for universities to ensure that they have the resources they need to meet the needs of their students. In terms of Brexit, he believes that it will have a positive impact on Welsh students, as they will be able to access higher education at a lower cost, and there will be a significant increase in the amount of funding available to them.

We'll have to decide whether or not they're related to one another or not, but the idea is that they're both related to the same thing, and we'll be able to merge them together in a way that makes it easier to understand each other.",

    "The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of providing support to those affected by COVID-19, particularly those who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, as well as those who are unable to work due to lack of financial support. He also emphasized the need for the government to work closely with the provinces and territories to ensure that they have the resources they need to deal with the crisis. The Prime Minister also emphasized that the government will continue to work with provinces and municipalities to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians, including those with disabilities. The government is committed to ensuring that all Canadians receive the necessary support, and the Prime Minister has also committed to providing financial assistance to those who need it. However, the government is aware of the challenges faced by the government in meeting the needs of those affected, and it is working to address them. We are committed to working with the government and the provinces to address these challenges, and we are working closely with them to find a solution. We will also work with the Minister of Veterans Affairs to address concerns raised by the families of those who lost their loved ones due to COVID. The Minister of Seniors has assured them that they will be able to access the assistance they need, and they are confident in their ability to access it. The Government of Canada is working hard to address the issue of the shortage of long-term care for seniors, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to provide additional support for those who require it. He has also pledged to provide financial support to people affected by the crisis, and he has also promised to continue to support the families affected by this pandemic.",
    "The Project Manager and Industrial Designer discussed the design of the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that the design should be simple and simple, and the User Interface suggested that the remote should have a simple design, with a simple shape and minimalistic design. The Industrial Designer also suggested that it should be easy to use, as it would be easier for the user to find the remote, and that the buttons should be easily recognisable and easy to find. The Project Manager agreed, and suggested that there should be no buttons on the remote except for the power button and the volume button, which would be placed on the right side of the device. The User Interface team agreed with this idea, but the Project Manager expressed concerns about the cost of the product, as they believed that the price would be too high for a remote control of this size, and they wanted to reduce it to a price point that would be affordable for the consumer. They also wanted to ensure that the product would be comfortable to hold and that it would fit comfortably in the user's hand. Marketing emphasized the importance of making the remote accessible to the average person, as well as making it easy for people to find it easily. Marketing also emphasized the need for the remote to be user-friendly, with buttons that are easy to reach and easy for users to find, while the user interface team emphasized that it was important for the product to be aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to use. The project manager agreed that the industrial designer's idea was a good one, as there was a lot to be done in terms of the design, including the color, shape, and shape of the front buttons, but they did not agree on the size of the buttons and the overall shape. The industrial designer proposed that the front button should be a square shape with a rounded shape and the project manager disagreed, stating that the shape would make it easier to find and more ergonomic. The team also agreed on the need to have a unique look and feel to the remote that would appeal to a wide variety of people, including those who are not used to having to use a lot of buttons and those who prefer to use only one remote control at a time. User Interface: I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be working on the design. marketing: Well from the mouse idea you could, remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press, whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the devices you push into device you see, like a mouse button. user interface: But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them industrial designer:. project manager: Yeah, that's must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons, that's certainly be different.",

They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a microphone into the remote, as well as the possibility to incorporate a speech recognition feature, which would allow the user to activate the remote by pressing a button on the screen. The project manager also mentioned the possibility for the user interface to change the shape of the remote to fit into a different shape, and suggested that the design should be based on the user's preference. The industrial designer also suggested the addition of a microphone to the remote and the idea was discussed, with a focus on the design of the device itself. The team discussed the feasibility of incorporating the idea into the product, considering the cost of the product and the need for a unique design. The Industrial Designer suggested the use of an industrial designer to design the remote with a unique shape, while the Project Manager suggested the incorporation of a speech-recognition feature, as it would allow users to activate it by pressing the button on a specific button. The User Interface team also proposed the inclusion of an integrated microphone, which was agreed upon by the Industrial Designer and Project Manager.

    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, said that the Deputy Minister's amendments to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill were aimed at raising awareness of the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. The Deputy Minister also highlighted the need for a public awareness campaign, which will be conducted over a period of six years from the date of the Bill's enactment. However, it is important to note that this campaign will not begin until after the Bill has been passed, and that it will focus on raising awareness about the importance of the law change and its impact on children and their families. I believe that the focus of the awareness campaign will be on the impact of the legislation on children, as well as on their families, and I am confident that the campaign will have a positive impact on their lives. Additionally, it will be important for the public to be aware of the implications of the changes to the law, as it is essential for the safety and well-being of children to be at the heart of their everyday lives. I also believe that it is vital for the Welsh Government to address the concerns raised by the public, as this Bill is likely to have a significant impact on the mental health and safety of children in Wales. I'm confident that this Bill will be well-received by parents and children alike, and we will be able to achieve the objectives of this Bill. I would also like to thank the committee for their consideration of this issue, as I believe it was a difficult decision to reach this point, but I understand that it was difficult for them to make a final decision.",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to recognise that there's a lot of work to be done, and we need to be careful not to lose sight of the fact that there are a number of challenges to be addressed, and I think that we have a lot to do to address them, but I think we're on the right track. Kirsty also highlighted the importance of having a national evaluation and improvement resource in place, as well as the need for a more robust approach to self-evaluation, which is something that the Minister has been working on for some time, and it's something that we're going to continue to focus on for the rest of the year. kirsty Williams am: It's important for us to have a system in place where we can assess the performance of individual schools, but it's also important for schools to know that they're not alone, and that they have the support of their local authorities and the Welsh Government, and they have a responsibility to ensure that they are able to address the challenges they face. So, we're working closely with the Ministry of Education and the OECD to develop a system that is more effective and more effective than any other system in the world. We need to make sure that schools have the right people in place to address these challenges, but we also need to work closely with local authorities, because they are the ones who have the power to implement it.",
    "kirsty williams am: So, we've been working with the OECD for a number of years now, and we have a lot of work to do to ensure that we have the right people involved in the process, and I think it's important for us to work closely with them, because we want to make sure that they have a good understanding of what they're doing and what they need to do. And I think there's a lot to be gained from that process, because it's not just about making sure that schools are performing well, but that they're performing well; it's about ensuring that there are people in the system who are doing the right things, and that they are making the right decisions. So, it was important for me to work with the Minister and the Director of Education to understand what they needed to do in order to achieve that goal. Kirsty Williams am: I think that's important, Kirsty, and it's also important for the Minister to understand that there is a need for a national evaluation and improvement resource, as well as a national model, because there are many schools in Wales that are currently in special measures, and they're not performing well. They're not meeting their targets, they are not achieving their goals, and there are other schools that are not meeting them, so it is important for them to be in a position to improve their performance and to have a better understanding of their strengths and their weaknesses. kirsty Willams am: It's important to note that the Minister has emphasised the importance of self-evaluation in the education system, and she has also emphasised that it is not a test of school readiness for reform, it is a genuine attempt for a school to evaluate their strengths, their weaknesses, and where they are going to go next. And because of the word 'toolkit'\u2014the feedback was that it gave the impression of a checklist, 'Just do this and check list'. We're in the testing phase at the moment and having it evaluated itself, with a view to introducing that resource across the system at the start of the new academic year, in September 2020. I truly believe that, if we're to make progress in Welsh education, we have to develop the skills within our system to have robust self-evaluate. I believe that the best way to do that is to focus on the strengths and the weaknesses.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the design of the remote control, with the project manager stating that the idea was to create a device with a unique look and feel, and the industrial designer stating that it was important to have a design that was unique to the brand. The project manager also mentioned the idea of having a remote control with a different shape and a different color, as well as a different material, as it would be easier for people to find and easier to use. The team also discussed the need for a new material for the case, as they were concerned about the cost of materials and the need to find a material that would fit in the budget budget. The industrial designer mentioned that they were looking for a lightweight material that could be used in a variety of shapes and sizes, including a plastic case and a metal case. They also considered a special case for the remote, but ultimately decided to go with a rubber material as it was cheaper and more durable than plastic, and they were confident that it would last for a long period of time. They were also confident that they would be able to adapt to different sizes and shapes, and that the design would not be too different from a standard remote control. However, they did not want to use the same material as last year, as there would be a risk of damage to the case if it were to be used for more than one remote control at a time. The idea of using a rubber case was discussed, and it was decided that the case would be made of rubber, with a plastic cover to protect it from scratches and a rubber band to hold it in place. The design team discussed the possibility of making the case out of plastic, but they decided against it because they believed that the material would be too expensive. They decided to use rubber instead, as the rubber material was more durable and would protect the case from scratches.",
    "Phd e: We have a lot of data to analyze and we have a bunch of different types of data, so we need to have a good idea of what we want to do with it phd a: So, for example, we have the data from the Finnish and Spanish samples, and we also have a data set from the Spanish and Finnish samples, but we don't have any data on the Finnish samples because they're different from the English samples, so it's hard to compare the two sets of data. professor b: And then we have to decide whether or not to use the Wiener filter or not, and then we'll have to make a decision on whether to use Wiener filtering or not. phd c: I think it's safe to assume that it's going to be Wiener, because it's the only filter that we know how to use, and I think that it would be a good choice for this particular case because it would allow us to reduce the amount of noise in the system. We also have to consider whether we should use a different filter for the Finnish sample or not because we have more data to work with, but it's not clear if we should go with Wiener or not based on the data we have. We have to wait until next week when Hynek comes back to the lab to see how things are going to work.. And then the the way that we had it in our proposal - two before, we had the neural net transformed features and we had a ton of features, which I guess you you actually did linearly transform with the KLT, to orthogonalize them but but but they were not, processed through a neural net. And Stephane's idea with that, as I recall, was that you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't, phd A: professor B: which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when, the testing set was quite different than what you ''d trained your discriminant features for. There're so many other choices to make that are are almost well, if not independent, certainly in addition to the choice of whether you, do spectral subtraction or Wiener filters, that, @ @ again we sort of felt the gang should just sort of figure out which it is they wanna do and then let's pick it, go forward with it..",
    "The group discussed the concept of a universal remote control, with the user interface designer suggesting that the remote control should be able to be customized to fit into different shapes and sizes, while the project manager suggested that the design should be based on the age of the person using the remote, as well as their age, gender, and income level. The project manager proposed that the product should be made of rubber, as it would be more durable than plastic, and that it should be easy to clean and easy to use. The user interface suggested that a rubber-based remote control would be easier to use, and the team agreed that it would not be too expensive, as long as it was not too heavy. The team also discussed the possibility of using rubber as a material for the buttons, considering the cost of the product, and suggested that it could be used for a variety of functions, such as changing the volume, adjusting volume, and adjusting the volume level. They also considered the idea of a push-button remote control that could be placed on the table, but ultimately decided to focus on a single-curved design, as they believed that it was easier for people to hold it in one hand and not have to lift it up to see what's on the screen. The group agreed on the need for a more advanced remote control and decided to design a new model with a more modern look and feel. The industrial designer proposed the use of rubber as the material, as the rubber was more durable and could be easily cleaned and easily cleaned.

And then after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what what the User Interface might desire as additional functionalities, we would need to design a new remote control for the TV, and we would like it to be simple, simple, and not too complicated. The main goal would be to create a simple and easy-to-use remote control and a simple design that would be easy to understand and simple enough for the average user to understand. The user interface suggested that the remote should be small, and the project manager agreed, but the user interface expressed concerns about the cost of the design, as they felt that the cost would be too high and that they would have to pay for a new design. The project manager suggested that they could incorporate a small screen into the remote, which would be easier to handle, and they also suggested that it could be placed on the right side of the screen, and that the user could use it to turn on and off by pressing a button on the remote.

    "Phd c: Yeah, we have a lot of features in the OGI, but we have some features that are not well matched and some of them are not good enough to be used, so we have to filter them out. professor b: Okay so we'll see if we can find a way to reduce the number of features, but it's not clear if it's possible to do that or not. phd d: I think it would be a good idea to have a low - pass filter, but I don't know if it would make a difference in the case of the Italian or not, but if it were to be, it wouldn't be a big deal because it would just be a small difference and it would only be noticeable to the user. We'll have to wait and see what the results look like, but the idea is to try to minimize the amount of time it takes for the filter to complete the task. Professor b: So let's take a look at the results and see if there are any differences between the two sets, and if there is a difference between the first and the second set, we'll adjust the filter accordingly. We also have to decide whether or not to change the filter or not because we don't want to lose any of the features from the first set, and we want to make sure that there are no errors in the second group of features.

We need to make sure that we're doing everything we can to reduce the number of overweight and obese people in Wales, but we also need to ensure that we do it in a way that is cost-effective and cost-efficient, and that's why we're going to have to look at how we can reduce the cost of obesity and overweight and overweight people's health. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. sian gwenllian am: Okay. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllain. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the floor of the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed? dr frank atherton: My advice was not that we don\u2019t need a target\u2014we may well need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable. And that if we are to choose a target, it needs to be a target that is achievable, and if it's achievable, it has to be attainable. So, there is something about performance management in there, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and how they can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we're to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target instead of choosing an aspirational target, what might that look like?

    "The team discussed the concept of a single-curved design for the remote control, with the idea of using the shape of the body to create a unique shape, as well as the possibility of using it for a variety of functions. The team agreed that the design of the design should be based on the user's preferences, with a focus on the shape and size of the remote, and the team agreed on the need for a simple design that would be user-friendly and easy to use. The industrial designer proposed a simple shape with a rounded shape, but the project manager disagreed, stating that it would be difficult to find a shape that would fit comfortably into a purse or purse. The project manager suggested that the user interface should be able to change the shape in the future, and suggested that it should be shaped in a way that would make it easier for users to find it. The user interface team agreed with this idea, and agreed that it was a good idea to use a single curve for the design, as it would allow for the user to easily adjust the shape. However, the industrial designer expressed concerns about the cost of the product, as they believed that the price would be too high, and they proposed a more affordable price of twenty-five Euros, which was agreed upon by the marketing team. The marketing team proposed a price point of fifteen Euros for the device, which would allow the team to design the product in a more cost-effective way. The Industrial Designer proposed a design that was more affordable than the other options, including a simple and simple design with a simple look and feel. The User Interface team agreed to the idea, as long as the design was not too complicated. The Project Manager proposed the use of a circular shape for the buttons, which the Industrial Designer agreed to, as he felt that the shape would be aesthetically pleasing to the user and would be easy to find easily.",
    "The project manager explained that the idea of a remote control was originally intended to be a simple and simple device, but it was found to be too hard to use, so the team decided to make it more complex, and the marketing team suggested that it should be more interesting and interesting, with a more modern look and feel. They also suggested that the design of the remote control should be based on the shape and feel of the device, and that the color should match the color of the TV screen, as well as the size and shape of the buttons. marketing: Okay so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general, consumers in particular, the number one thing that was found was that the br t television remote control, a fancy look and feels, okay, and not, it specified, not a functional look or or feel, but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons. So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing, is that I think what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and serve the user, and not so much to the functionality of it. marketing: For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something, you know what, like, or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative project manager: -huh. there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that The buttons should be large. one of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them, project manager, user interface: so the up volume button looks like it's gonna be a down volume, and I'm not sure if there's any other examples, but if there is, I think it would be a good idea to incorporate it into the design, but I don't know if it's the right time to do it, but we'll see what we can do.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the design of the remote control, with the industrial designer suggesting that it should be simple and user-friendly, and the user interface suggested that the user should be able to control the remote by pressing a single button on the right side of the device, while the project manager suggested that it would be easier for the user to use the remote than a traditional remote control. The user interface proposed that the remote should be small and easy to carry around, with a simple design, and that the buttons should be easy to find and be easily accessible to the user. The industrial designer suggested that there should be no buttons on the top of the control, as it would make it easier for people to find the remote and it would also be easier to use. The project manager also suggested that users should be aware of the fact that they could lose their remote control if they lose it, and they should have a way to replace it with a new one, as they could easily replace it if they lost it. user interface: but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting, just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll take a feedback from the marketing because, I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. Now the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work, as I said about the alternative batteries we were gonna choose, we can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine., that's so this is if you ask me personally, I would make flip-top with a trendy design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that.",
    "The Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic has been working to address the issue of racism in Canada, with the aim of creating a society where people of all races, ethnicities, religions, genders, and genders are treated with dignity and respect, and the government has made significant investments to enable the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide more mental health services to people who have experienced racism or intergenerational trauma. We have also created the anti-racism secretariat, which has an envelope of $4.6million, to address systemic barriers, such as employment, justice and social participation, that perpetuate injustice. While we've made some progress, there is still so much more to do, because here are the facts in Canada: Anti-black racism is real. Chair, every Canadian who has felt the weight of oppression, every student who has the courage to demand a better future, every person who marches and posts and reads and fights, from Vancouver to Montreal to Halifax, expects more than the status quo. Together, generations of Canadians who trace their roots back to countries around the world have built Canada to truly the greatest country on earth, the true north strong and free. They are a result of systems that far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate and perpetuate inequality and injustice against people of colour. To ensure that our people remain free, we must continue to fight attacks on our freedoms, including racism and all forms of brutality and injustice in Canada and across the world, as John Diefenbaker said, I am a Canadian...free to speak without fear, free to worship...in my own way, free from fear. It's not an excuse to not step up, stand up for each other, be an ally. I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician. I'm not here today to describe a reality I do not know or to speak to a pain I have not felt. We are all created in the image and likeness of God, and because of that, we are all equal. Canada is a nation of immigrants that stands on the traditional territories of first nations, Inuit and Mtis people. Waves of newcomers have come to Canada for a better life because our country is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law and fundamental and universal human rights. There are those who say that diversity is our strength, and that is true, but it doesn't quite capture the full picture. It is the freedom for people to preserve and pass on their cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around them; the freedom to live your life with equality under the law, regardless of your race or ethnic background; and the economic freedom that so many governments around the nation deny their people. Together we can build a better world for the next generation. While there are many things we can point to in our history with pride, that is not to say that we have a perfect record, nor that we are immune to the threat of racism, nor is it an American problem. Canada has had its own dark episodes of racism that cannot be ignoredsadly, not just in our past. No one should be attacked in their community or targeted on the bus because of the colour of their skin. We don't play politics at the funeral doors: we gather our thoughts, and let indignation and sadness be expressed. We must always protect the rights of people who are protesting peacefully and within the law for a just cause and separate them from those who exploit tragedies to commit acts of violence. I believe, however, that there may be traces of horrible things left in our institutions that colour our relationships with people of different origins or with people who were here long before us. I want to thank my colleagues, community leaders and fellow Canadians for opening my eyes to what is really going on in our communities and for helping me better understand both privilege and power.",
    "Phd d: I think it would be a good idea to have the transcribers do the transcribing, because they have a lot of experience with this type of thing, and I think that they would be able to do a better job with it, and it would also be interesting to see how it would work in the future. grad f: It would be nice to have a system that was able to recognize the number of digits in a particular order, so that it could be used as a reference point for future research. professor c: Yeah, I think we could do that, but I don't know if it's practical to do that right now, because it would require too much time and energy, and we don't have the time to dedicate to it. postdoc b: But I think the idea is to have them do it, because I think they're going to have to spend a lot more time on it than we do, and they'll have more time to work with it. The idea is that they'll be using it as a training set, and then they'll use it to learn from the data. The goal is for them to learn how to use the data, and the goal is to eventually use it for their own research. Phd f: So the idea was to use it as an example to show that there are different types of speech, and that it's possible to have different kinds of speech in different languages, and also to see if there are any differences between the different languages and whether they're related to each other or not. The only thing is I'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena, in w i i The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with the the experiment, we wouldn't know the answer to now but might, do some guessing, but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti, marking of articulatory, features, with overlap and so on, with overlap, and so forth.. The idea was for the team to use this data to train the system, but the team wanted to make sure that they had enough time to do it properly.",
    "The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be able to change channels, and the project manager agreed, but the industrial designer suggested that it would be difficult for the user to find the remote, as they would have to hold it in their hands, and they would need to find it with their hands. The Industrial Designer also suggested that there should be a button on the remote to turn it on and off, and that it should be easy to find, and it should not be too hard to use, as long as it's not too heavy. The industrial designer also suggested the idea of a speech recognition feature, which would allow users to activate the remote by pressing a button and it would turn on or off, but it would require a certain amount of effort to make it work. The project manager suggested that this feature could be incorporated into the design of the product, as it could be used in a variety of scenarios, such as in the kitchen, in the living room, or in the bedroom, or even in the bathroom. However, the Industrial Designer was concerned about the cost of the device, as he felt that the cost would be too high, and he wanted to reduce it to a more affordable price point. He also suggested making the remote less expensive, as the cost could be reduced by using a different material, as opposed to using plastic or metal, which he felt would be more expensive. The User Interface team agreed with this idea, as well as the Industrial Design team, with the User Interface suggesting that the design should be based on the user's personal preferences, with a focus on aesthetics and functionality. The Project Manager proposed that the product should be simple and simple, with no buttons or buttons on the front and back of the remote except for the power button and the volume button, and should be made of plastic or rubber, with an LCD screen that could change colors depending on the needs of the user.",
    "Meilyr rowlands: I think it's important to recognise that there's a lot of work to be done, and we need to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves, but I think that there are a number of things that we can do to make sure that we have a smooth transition to the new curriculum, and I think we're doing a good job of doing that. I think there is a lot to be gained from the work of the regional consortia and the Cabinet Secretary, and they're doing an excellent job in terms of their work, and it's a good thing that they're working closely with the Ministry of Education and the education system. We need to ensure that they have the support they need to do that work, but we also need to look at how we can support them to do it. suzy davies am: Can I just ask you then about the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools, which I've just mentioned previously, and also what your views are on the impact of funding for schools on that as well? Because we're in a situation where a couple of primary schools have got surplus funds, sometimes that's because of end of year additional funds just being magicked up, but there are others that are in deficit. Is there a correlation between those two positions, that secondary schools may be less ready for this than primary schools, and is there a need for more funding for secondary schools to get to grips with this, albeit that there'll be a phasing in, or is it likely to have an impact on the ability of schools to really get a grip on this? meilyr Rowlands: Yes, there are currently discussions ongoing between us and the Government about working in those early years for teachers. I know that Professor Mick Waters is looking at this currently and we've had the discussion with him. Now, we are, of course, looking at initial teacher training but we haven't looked at the first couple of years for many a year. And for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on that particular issue, and that work will be published in due course. sian gwenllian am: Okay, and on that point of comparing year on year, we will be able to make those comparisons legitimately then?",
    "The team discussed the concept of the remote control, with the project manager stating that it would be a simple device that could be used to turn on and off the TV, turn on the television, turn off the lights, adjust the volume, and adjust the temperature of the room, as well as controlling the volume and volume of the TV. The project manager suggested that the remote could be placed on a coffee table, and the industrial designer suggested placing it on the coffee table for easy access. The industrial designer proposed placing the remote on the table, but the user interface team suggested that it should be placed in the center of the table so that it could be easily accessible. The team agreed that it was a good idea to place the remote in the middle of a table, as it would make it easier for people to find it. The Industrial Designer suggested placing the TV remote on top of the television and the User Interface team proposed placing it at the top of a pile of pillows or on the edge of the couch, as long as it was not too far away from the television. The Project Manager suggested placing a small remote on a table in the corner of the living room, and considering the possibility of placing it in a corner, the Industrial Designer agreed to place it on a shelf in the kitchen. The User Interface group proposed placing a remote control on the left side of the dining room table, while the Industrial Design team suggested placing one on the right side for easier access. They also suggested having a small button on the back of the device to activate the remote, similar to a light switch, to make it easy to find.",

The project manager also suggested using a rubber case for the buttons, which was met with skepticism from the marketing department, as they believed that it would be too expensive, and they were concerned about the cost of the product. The industrial designer proposed that the remote should be made of plastic, with a rubber body and a plastic body, and that it shouldn't be too heavy or bulky, as it would make it difficult for people to hold it in one hand. The team also discussed the possibility of making the remote more ergonomic, as well as the idea of having the buttons in different colors, but the team ultimately decided to go with a fruity color for the fruity option. The marketing team also suggested that they would like to design the remote with a different color for each button, as there were too many colors to choose from and they didn't want to have too many different colors on the remote. The user interface team also proposed using a different shape for the power button and the volume button, but they were not satisfied with the design of the remote, as the buttons were too large and too hard to hold. The group decided to focus on a simple design with a simple look and feel, with only one button on each side of the device, and it was decided that the buttons should be in the shape of a banana or a banana. Marketing also suggested the addition of a microphone and a speaker, but industrial designer argued that this would be a waste of money, as people wouldn't be able to hear it anyway, so they decided to keep it simple.",

Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, said that the focus of the new curriculum was to provide an opportunity for the profession to have greater autonomy and agency, as well as the ability to adapt the curriculum to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. However, she also highlighted the need for the introduction of the Welsh dimension in the curriculum, which would include a focus on the Welsh language and culture, and the need to address the concerns raised by parents and teachers about the quality of the curriculum. She also emphasised that it was essential for the education system to have a strong focus on Welsh, as it would be important for the future of the profession.",
    "User interface: I think it would be a good idea to make the remote control look and feel like a fruit, but I don't know if it's going to be able to hold a bunch of different shapes and sizes, and I'm not sure if I can hold it in my hand or not. user interface: Okay so that's just industrial designer: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere User Interface: So you have to have a button on your on your, and if you just tap on it, it'll bring up the menu, but if you hold it down, you'll have to press the button on the right side of the remote, and then it'll go to the center of the screen. Industrial designer: Yeah, I think we can do that, but we need to make sure that it's not too big, because it would make it difficult for people to hold it, and it would take up a lot of space. User interface: So we're going to have to find a way to make it easier to hold, and we're not sure how to do it, but it should be easy to hold and it shouldn't be too hard to hold. Industrial Designer: I'm sure we can come up with a variety of shapes, but the idea is to have different sizes and shapes for the different sizes, so that people can choose the size and shape of their own remote controls. Marketing: Okay, so we'll see if there are any vegetables that look like vegetables, and the project manager says that there are a few, but he doesn't know how many there are, so it's hard to say whether or not there are more than one, but they're all within the range of one to two sizes. The project manager and industrial designer discussed the possibility of making the remote with different colors and shapes, with the idea of using different sizes for different shapes. User Interface suggested that the remote should be shaped into a triangle shape, and Industrial Designer suggested making it into a square shape, but User Interface pointed out that the shape of the shape would be too small, so they could use the shape as a base for the remote. The industrial designer suggested making the shape look like a triangle, and User Interface agreed, but Industrial Designer disagreed, saying that it wouldn't be practical for the size of the device.",
    "The main elements of remote controls in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip and the battery. I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet, just keep that in mind, but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic, the m the main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titanium, rubber or other coloured types of plastic. We have a number of different choices for a design concept and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of, but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work, industrial designer: user interface: how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device. once we've chosen a a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concept, making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features. The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever, you can work out which button's which and basically, yeah it's ith it's fun.",

We've got the two scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the volume and the one for the channel and underneath we have the the turbo button which is in like a nice trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally. marketing: How man user interface: Well then you can you you have like a little number selection thing, you press the the teletext button to move between the fields and then you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero, so you have to scroll to zero, but you know you can always use your other remote if you want to. User Interface: Yeah, I think we can do that, but I don't think it's necessary because we already have a bunch of other remote controls and we don't want to lose any of them. Industrial designer: Okay, so we're going to make a banana for the base station, but we're not sure if people are going to want to buy a banana or not, but if they do, we'll have to find a way to incorporate the banana into the remote. Marketing: So we have to decide whether or not we want to use the banana for teletext or not and then we'll decide if it's too expensive or not. Industrial Designer: We have to make sure that we have enough space for the banana to fit comfortably in the remote, and we want it to be ergonomic so that it's comfortable to hold in the hand. We want to make it easy to hold and easy to handle, and the idea is that it will be easy for people to hold it in their hand and it won't fall off when they want to pick it up.",

The team decided to focus on a simple design, with a simple look and simple functions, and the idea was to make the remote remote control look like a normal remote control, but with the ability to change channels and adjust the volume and volume of the channel. They also discussed the possibility of adding features to the remote, such as buttons for volume, volume, and volume, but the project manager expressed concern about the cost of the product, as it would require a lot of time and money. The project manager also mentioned the need for a more advanced remote control that would be able to control the TV, but they were not sure if it would be possible to do that, as there were only a handful of people who would be willing to pay extra for the remote. The marketing team suggested that the remote should be simple, with only basic functions like volume, mute, and on and off, and that it should not be too complicated, as long as it was easy to use and easy to understand. The idea was also to make it easy for the user to find the remote with the help of a smartphone app, but it was decided that it would not be necessary to have a dedicated button for each channel, as the remote would only be used once a day. However, the team agreed that it was important to include a button for the volume, as this would be the most important feature for the elderly, and they were willing to spend more money for it. Marketing also suggested the addition of a remote button for volume control, which was agreed upon by the team, but there was no consensus on whether or not it was a good idea to include it or not.",

Industrial Designer: It would be nice to have the ability to change the color of the screen, but it would also be nice if the user could see what they're doing, because it would make it easier for them to understand what they are doing.",
    "The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HFCW) is responsible for the provision of higher education in Wales, and they have a responsibility to ensure that it meets the needs of the sector, as well as providing support for Welsh students. They are also responsible for ensuring that students are able to access the services they need. However, they also have the responsibility to make sure that they have the resources to meet the demands of their students, and that they are adequately funded to meet their needs. They also have responsibility for ensuring the sustainability of the system and the quality of the education system. The HFCW is working closely with the Welsh government to ensure a smooth transition to a post-Brexit Wales, with the aim of ensuring that the system is in place by the end of the next academic year. They will also work closely with universities and other stakeholders to ensure the safety and security of students and to ensure they are not adversely affected by Brexit. They have also identified a number of challenges that need to be addressed, including the impact of Brexit on the future of the Welsh education system, which they hope to address in the next two years. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the European Union, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review. john griffiths am: In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be? bethan owen: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS data. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as Welsh students, so, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come. But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Brexit process was addressing. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and particularly buildings and kit, and a relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u20ac100,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the students' mind. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are starting to become a little bit more difficult.",
    "Chair, I would like to begin today's meeting by expressing my condolences to the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to the families of those who have lost their loved ones, and to all Canadians who have been affected by this tragedy. I want to express my support for the victims and their families, and I hope that they will be able to find comfort in knowing that they are not alone in their grief and that they have the support and support of the government and the people of Canada. I would also like to thank Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister Trudeau for their support and understanding of the challenges faced by people of colour in the wake of the pandemic. I believe that the Canadian government is not racist, and that the governments of our municipalities are not racist either, but I believe, however, that there may be traces of horrible things left in our institutions that colour our relationships with people of different origins or with people who were here long before us. I am concerned when anyone suggests that we are all collectively inclined to engage in systemic discrimination or when anyone claims to be a bulwark of virtue between us and the victims. The calls for justice, for equality and for peace are found echoed in our communities, because anti-black racism is happening here, everywhere in Canada, every single day. I'm also talking about microaggressions, which many of us may not even see. When it comes to being an ally, I have made serious mistakes in the past, mistakes that I deeply regret and continue to learn from. It's not an excuse to not step up, stand up for each other, be an ally. I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician. Chair, that is a powerful message about how each one of us can use our democratic rights to effect change. In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutely no room for intolerance, racism and extremism of any kind. To ensure that our people remain free, we must continue to fight attacks on our freedoms, including racism and all forms of brutality and injustice in Canada and around the world, as John Diefenbaker said, I am a Canadian...free to speak without fear, free to worship...in my own way. As a result, I stand for what I think right, to oppose what I believe wrong, and free to choose those who shall govern my country. We have made significant investments to enable the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide more mental health services to people who have experienced racism or intergenerational trauma, and we have also created the anti-racism secretariat, which has an envelope of $4.6million, to address systemic barriers, such as employment, justice and social participation, that perpetuate injustice. While we've made some progress, there's still so much more to do, because here are the facts in Canada: Anti-Black racism is real. While there are many things we can point to in our history with pride, that's not to say that we have a perfect record, nor that we're immune to the threat of racism, nor is it an American problem. It is the frequency of manifestations of certain genetic traits favoured by geography and history, which in turn shape cultures. Racism expresses itself first and foremost through aggression against what is presumed to be the culture of others, difference. Our nation has benefited immensely from great Canadians who overcame prejudices and discrimination to serve their communities and make Canada a better country: Lincoln Alexander, elected as a Conservative in 1968, was the first black member of Parliament and went on to become the first African-Canadian prime minister; John Ware was born into slavery in South Carolina but, following the American Civil War, was a leading figure in bringing the first cattle to Alberta and spearheading the ranching industry that would become the backbone of the province; Josiah Henson escaped slavery to become a thriving businessman in Ontario; and of course, Viola Desmond challenged segregation in Nova Scotia. Black Canadians throughout history have not just built this nation with their contributions; they have also represented Canada with excellence and pride on the world stage, like Harry Jerome, who represented Canada in three Olympic Games and won a bronze medal in 1964. He would go on to becoming a teacher in British Columbia, once again serving with excellence to try to make a better world for the next generation.",
    "The House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic has been working closely with the Ministry of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to ensure the safety and security of Canadians in the event of a pandemic, and the government is committed to ensuring a safe and secure environment for Canadians. They provide hundreds of billions of dollars worth of services to commercial agricultural crops and other ecological services every year. This petition calls on the Government of Canada, for the sake of bees and our food security, to follow Europe's lead and adhere to the precautionary principle by banning the use of neonicotinoids in Canada. It raises big questions about the choices facing seniors in certain situations, which is what makes this first petition particularly timely. I am tabling a petition related to Bill C-7, the government's euthanasia bill, which seeks to dramatically remove safeguards that the government said were vital only a short time ago. When some people are living in deplorable conditions, we cannot truly speak of them as having a choice of when they ought to die. Especially in light of that new information, I commend this petition for the consideration of members of the House. The second petition is in support of Bill S-204 on organ harvesting and trafficking, put forward in the Senate. The bill would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ without the donor's consent. It relates to what I think many of us will regard as the real heroes of the last few months. The petitioners have asked the government to implement a wage supplement as a temporary measure to bring the wages for those who are in contact with the general public and working in what has been deemed an essential service to no less than $20 an hour. After a courageous search mission by Canadian Coast Guard auxiliary members and the Department of National Defence and Provincial Airlines, he is unfortunately still missing. She said that when we present petitions, we are simply supposed to give one or two sentences before putting them on the table. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that when they are presenting petitions, they should be very concise with the prcis that they give up front, as opposed to going on for a long time. Now we will proceed to statements by members for a period not exceeding 15 minutes, and each statement will be for one minute. peter fonseca (mississauga eastcooksville, lib.): Thank you, Mr. Today I am honoured to recognize the youth in my riding of Mississauga EastCooksville who are part of the 52nd Mississauga Scouts. For over a decade, I've had the great opportunity to join the Scouts every year during the month of May for the door-to-door food drives. This year has been a lot different, owing to COVID situation, but our Scouts are not used to saying the word impossible. David Chant, head leader for their cub pack, reached out to share that the youth have found innovative ways to engage our community through a virtual food bank. I say a big thank you to Scout leaders like David, who are strong role models for our youth, teaching them the importance of leadership, kindness and giving back. David and his group of Scouts raised over $46,000 worth of food last year for the Mississauga Food Bank and The Compass. Again, I give a huge virtual high-five to all of our young Scouts, who have taken the lead with lots of compassion and care.",
    "User interface: Okay, we have a lot of different types of remote controls, but we're not sure what we want to do with the remote control, so we're going to have to find a way to incorporate them all into the same remote control. Marketing: I think it would be a good idea to make a small remote control that can be used for different purposes, but it would cost a lot more money than a regular remote control because it would have to be small enough to fit in a purse or purse. Industrial designer: I don't know how much money we have to spend, but I think we can do it for less than a hundred Euros, and I think that's a good amount of money. User Interface Designer: Yeah, it's a lot cheaper than a normal remote, and it's also a lot easier to use, so it's going to cost less than one hundred Euros. Industrial Designer: I'm not sure if we'll be able to sell the remote, but if we do, we'll have to make it bigger and more expensive, and we'll need to make sure that it's not too big or too small, because if it's too big, people won't want to use it anymore. Project Manager: We're not going to sell it, we're just going to give it to people who want it, and if they want to buy it, they can buy it from us, and then we'll sell it to them.. project manager: but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little marketing: industrial designer: Oh that's okay, I'll just draw a picture of a dog and then I'll put it on the front of the remote and I'll turn it on and it'll turn on and off, and you can turn on the TV or whatever you want to play the game. user interface: Well, I think the idea of having a remote control with a big screen and a small screen is really cool, but there's no need for it to be too big because it wouldn't fit in your purse or anything like that. marketing: I know, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with it, I just don't think it's practical to have too many buttons on it, so I'm going to put a small one on the back of it. User interface: It's not that big, it just has to be a little bit smaller than the other remote controls we already have, and that's all you need to do.",
    "The team discussed the design of the remote control, with User Interface suggesting that it should be simple and simple, and Industrial Designer suggesting that the design should be based on the user's preference, and User Interface suggested that the user should be able to use the remote to control their television without having to hold it in their hand, as it would be easier for them to use it. The Industrial Designer proposed that the remote should be easy to use and easy to understand, with a simple design, and the User Interface emphasized the importance of having a user-friendly design, with the idea that it shouldn't be too complicated or too hard to use. The User Interface team suggested that they would like to have a simple and stylish design, but the Industrial Designer emphasized the need for an ergonomic design, as they felt that it was important for the user to feel comfortable with the remote, and that they wanted it to be ergonomic and comfortable to hold. The user interface team also suggested that there should be no buttons on the remote except for the power button and the volume button, and they suggested that it be placed on the right side of the device, so that it doesn't interfere with the television and that it could be placed in the center of the screen. The industrial designer also suggested the addition of a speaker to the remote so that people could hear what they wanted to say, as well as a speaker for the volume and a microphone for the voice recognition. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating voice recognition into the remote as a feature, with Industrial Designer stating that it would make it easier for people to understand what they want to say and it would allow them to control the remote with their voice.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of integrating the remote control into a remote control, with the idea of having a button on the left side of the remote to control the television, and the team agreed that it would be a good idea to have a small button on it, as it would make it easier to reach and easier to use. The team also discussed the need for a voice recognition system that would be able to recognize the user's voice, as well as the importance of a user-friendly remote control that could be easily recognisable. The group agreed that the remote should be easy to use, and that it should be simple to use and easy to understand, with a simple design and a simple look and feel. However, there were concerns about the cost of the project, as there was a lot of money involved in the design, and there was no guarantee that the project manager would be satisfied with the cost, as they had to pay for the remote, but they were confident that they would have enough money to cover the cost. The project manager also mentioned that the team would need to find a way to make the remote more user friendly, as the buttons were too large and too hard to reach, and they wanted to reduce the size of the buttons to fit into a smaller package. The industrial designer suggested that the design should be based on the design of the Playstation controller, with four buttons on the right side, a red button on left, a green button on right, a blue button on top, and a yellow button on bottom. The remote control should be shaped like a joystick, and it should have a different shape depending on what the user wants it to look like, but it should still have the same shape as a regular television remote control. The idea of using a joystick to control a television was discussed, but the industrial designer pointed out that it was not practical to incorporate a joystick into the remote because it would require too many buttons and it would take up too much space, so they decided to go for a simpler design, with just one button on each side and a small number of buttons. The user interface team also suggested the addition of a small joystick to the remote that would allow the user to easily reach it, which would be useful for people with disabilities, but there was concern that it could be difficult to use due to its size and the lack of ergonomics.",
    "Phd d: We have a lot of work to do in terms of analyzing the data, but we have a good idea of what we want to do, and I think it would be interesting to see if we can find a way to do it in the future. The team discussed the possibility of using the power cables as a source of information, as it would allow them to analyze the data more easily, and it was suggested that the team would be able to use them as a reference point for future research. They also discussed the idea of using a speech-to-text conversion algorithm, which would allow the team to create a speech synthesizer that would be more accurate than a voice synthesizer, as well as a speech recognition algorithm that could be used to generate a speech signal. The group discussed the importance of having a good understanding of the speech signal, and the team agreed that it was important to have a system that was capable of recognizing the speech, and they decided to focus on the topic of speech recognition. They decided to use a speech synthesis algorithm that was based on speech recognition, with the goal of being able to recognize speech in a variety of different languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Spanish. The goal was to find a system capable of generating speech, which was achieved by using a combination of speech and speech recognition techniques, such as speech recognition and voice recognition. However, the team realized that speech recognition was not the only way to achieve this goal, as they also needed to consider the use of a voice recognition algorithm to generate speech, as there was a lack of data on the subject's voice, and there was no way to determine whether they were speaking in English or French. The research team decided to adopt the speech recognition method, which is based on the concept of speech synthesis, in which speech recognition is used to create speech synthesizers that can recognize speech and generate speech. To address this issue, the group decided to introduce a new method for generating speech recognition based on voice recognition, where speech recognition would be performed on the basis of speech, rather than speech recognition. The only thing is I'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena, in w i i The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with robustness, there's no need to use speech recognition in the first place, but there's a lot to gain from it.",
    "The group discussed the need for a new design for the remote control, with the project manager stating that they would like to use a new look and feel, as well as a new feel, and the idea of having a small screen on the front of the remote, which would allow users to easily change channels. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a small LCD screen into the remote to display the channel information, and they discussed the feasibility of using a single or double-curved case for the small screen. The project manager suggested that the remote should be made of plastic or wood, as it would be easier for people to hold it in their hands and not have to lift it off the table, and it would also be more comfortable for people with arthritis. The team discussed the potential for a different shape and size of the screen, with a focus on the size and shape of the display, and a discussion on the possibility to use the screen as a power button. The group agreed that the design should be simple, with only one button on the right side, and that the power button should be placed on the left side of the device, as opposed to the left, as the current remote control has two buttons on the top and one on the bottom. The industrial designer suggested using a plastic case, but the marketing team disagreed, stating that the cost of the case would be too high and that it would take too long to make a case for a remote control that would fit in a purse or purse. The marketing team suggested using plastic instead of wood for the case, as they believed it would make the remote more attractive and easier to hold. The idea of a single-curve design was proposed, but it was quickly dismissed by the industrial designer, who pointed out that it wouldn't be practical, as there would be a lot of wear and tear on the case if it were to be used for more than one remote control. However, the team agreed that it was a good idea to use plastic for the cover, as long as it was not too expensive.",
    "sally jenkins: I think it's important to recognise that this is a complex issue, and there are a lot of different views on how to address it, and we need to make sure that we have a clear definition of what constitutes appropriate and appropriate behaviour, and it is important to ensure that it is consistent with the principles of the Bill. However, we are aware that there are concerns about the impact of this Bill on children and families, and the need for clarity around the definition of appropriate behaviour is important, as well as ensuring that the Bill is well-considered and well-thought-out. We are aware of the concerns raised by the Equal Protection Network and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru in relation to this Bill, but we are also aware of concerns from the Association of Directors of Education Wales and the Welsh Local Government Association regarding the Bill's impact on children's services. We know that there is a need for consistency in the Bill in terms of how it is implemented, but it is also important to be mindful of the importance of ensuring that it meets the needs of children and their families.",
    "user interface: the thing is we do need to develop our technology of actually how to program the menus and what sort of, you know, text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen, marketing: This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation, and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department. material, I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit, but I think we have two different options, because we did make a another one, which wa is in the shape of banana, it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shapes of a banana, project manager: User interface: which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design. user interface: That isn't that, but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff, marketing: I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana, and of the two I really like I m I like the banana, and I think it would be a really good idea to have it in two colors, because it would make it easier for people to find it.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, and Karen Cornish, Deputy Director, Children and Families Division at Welsh Government, presented their views on the amendments to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. They highlighted the need for a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the change in the law, as well as the need to ensure that the public are aware of the implications of the law change. They also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the Bill is implemented in a way that respects the rights of children and their families. The Deputy Minister emphasized that it was important for the public to understand the impact of the Bill, as it would be difficult for them to make a decision without knowing the full extent of the changes to the law. However, the Deputy Minister argued that it would not be possible for the Welsh Government to implement the Bill without knowing all of the details of the new law, and suggested that the government should consult with the expert group before making any decisions. As such, the committee agreed to adopt the amendments proposed by the deputy minister, with the understanding that they would be considered for the next stage of the process. The committee also agreed to consider amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the duty to promote public awareness, and to amend amendments 1B to 1C to include information on parenting support. I believe that the focus of the awareness campaign should be on children and families, as they are the most vulnerable groups affected by this law change, and it is essential that they are informed about the implications. I also believe that it is important for parents to be aware of their rights, and that they should not be penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, and I ask Members to reject amendments 1 A to 1 E because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the bill.",

    "kirsty williams am: So, this brings us back to the principle of self-evaluation and something, if we're honest, we've not been very good at. And the types of interventions that have been used have included, in some cases, appointing additional governors to governing bodies, or suspending a school's delegated budget so the local authority takes on, then, financial control of that particular school, or sometimes applying to the Welsh Government to entirely replace a governing body and establish an intervention board. So, if I can give you an example of where that's been used and has been successful, in Flintshire. They applied to Welsh Government for two interim executive boards, in Sir Richard Gwyn Catholic High School and in Ysgol Trefonnen. The IEBs were put in place and both of those schools, which had been in special measures, moved quite rapidly, actually, out of special measures. Perhaps the most recent example of this is one that the Chair will know very well in her own constituency of Torfaen, in Cwmbran High School. My expectation always is that local authorities should be the first port of call, and I would encourage\u2014and we always encourage\u2014local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and to use those powers.",
    "User interface: We have a lot of options for the remote control, but we're not sure if we're going to be able to use it all the time, so we're gonna have to find a way to make it more useful, but I think it would be a good idea to have a button on the right side of the remote, so that it's easy to find and easy to use. Industrial designer: Yeah, I think we can do that, but it's gonna cost a lot more money than we think it's worth. User Interface: I think the idea of having a remote control is really interesting, and I think there's a market for it, and it's a really interesting idea. Industrial Designer: Yeah I agree with you, it's really interesting to have the ability to control the remote from the outside, and the idea is to have it on the inside, so it can be used in different situations, like when you're in a meeting or something like that. user interface: So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber, so it's pretty hard to actually damage it project manager: Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it? user Interface: Yeah that might be a possible a mi possible problem, but if you drop it industrial designer: Not helping. marketing: Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after industrial Designer: W we need we need, we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff, but user Interface, we could get another version of it that actually works, but marketing: Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradeable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything, but that's that was just an idea I had. to me the only additions project Manager: Yeah, the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well, or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons, you know what they do, it's very simple, and it just works.",
    "Kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we need to be mindful of those challenges, and I think that we have to be careful not to lose sight of the fact that we are in a unique situation, where we have a unique set of challenges in Wales, and it is important for us to ensure that we do everything we can to address them. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), and I am confident that we will be able to address these challenges in the new legislation. sian gwenllian am: I would like to ask Kirsty to clarify that the Minister for Education is not planning to repeal the 2015 Act, but rather to introduce a new Bill to regulate the higher education sector in Wales. Kirsty Williams am: Yes, the Minister is aware of this issue, and she is aware that there is a need for a review of the current legislation, but she is confident that it can be amended to reflect the needs of the sector in the future.

    "The group discussed the feasibility of the remote control, with the project manager stating that it would be expensive, but they were confident that they would be able to meet the cost of the product, and the industrial designer stating that the cost would be within the budget. The project manager also mentioned the possibility of making a smaller version of the device, which would be more cost-effective, as they would not have to deal with the extra costs associated with a larger remote control. They also discussed the need for a smaller remote control that could be easily accessible, as well as one that would be easy to find and easy to use. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be shaped like a banana, and that it could be used as a remote control or as a phone, as long as it was not too heavy or bulky. The team agreed that it was a good idea to use a rubber case for the remote, as it would make it easier for people to hold it in their hands, and it would allow them to easily adjust the volume and volume of the screen. However, they were concerned about the cost, as there were concerns about the quality of the rubber case, and they wanted to make sure that it didn't have any defects. The group agreed that the product should be simple and simple, with a simple design and a simple user interface, but there were some issues with the design, such as the lack of buttons, and a lack of ergonomics. Marketing emphasized the importance of having a user-friendly design, and asked the team to focus on making the remote accessible to everyone, while the Industrial Designer emphasized the need to make it easy to hold and use, and suggested that it should not be too bulky or heavy. The Industrial Designer proposed that the design should be based on the design of the phone, with buttons on the left and right sides, and there should be a button on the right side for volume and a button in the middle for volume.

    "The group discussed the possibility of using a CD as a backup device, with the idea that it would be convenient for people to have access to it in the event of an emergency, as well as the possibility that it could be used for research purposes. They also discussed the importance of having a computer in the room, as it would allow them to easily access the data, as they would be able to access it in case of emergency. The group agreed that they would like to use a CD for this purpose, but they were not sure if they would have to pay for it, as there was no guarantee that they wouldn't lose it if they didn't have it, and they were unsure if they could find it in their possession.

The Project Manager also mentioned that the team would like to incorporate a remote control with voice recognition, but they were unsure if it was possible to incorporate it into the design of the product. The Industrial Designer suggested using a single-curved screen, but the team decided to go with a double-curve design, as they believed that the design would be more aesthetically pleasing. They also considered the idea of using a different material for the case, but ultimately decided against it, as the cost of the case was too high. The industrial designer suggested using plastic instead of wood for the display, as there was no need for it to be too expensive, and they were confident that they would be able to sell the product for less than $20. The group decided to use a plastic case for the remote because it was cheaper than wood, and it was easier to handle and more durable than a wood case. The user interface team also suggested using an LCD screen instead of a curved one, as this would be the most cost-effective option, as well as having a smaller screen that would be easy to hold in one hand and easy to reach.

The project manager agreed that the cost would be too high for a remote control of this size, but they were confident that they would be able to meet the needs of the user, and that it would not cost more than twenty-five Euros. The team discussed the possibility of using a double-curved case for the remote, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost of materials and the need for a more durable material. The industrial designer suggested using a rubber case, which was rejected by the marketing team, as it was too expensive, while the user interface suggested using plastic for the voice recognition function, as they believed that the rubber material would be more durable than the rubber. However, the industrial designer argued that the plastic material could be used for other functions, such as changing the volume and adjusting the volume of the speaker, as well as adding additional features such as voice recognition.

    "user interface: I think it would be a good idea to have a button on the right side of the remote control to control the volume, but I don't know if it's practical to have it on the left or the right, so I'm not sure if I should put it there or not. marketing: It would be nice if it could be on and off, but we need to make sure that it's easy to use and easy to understand. user interface: Okay, so we're going to start with the basic functions, like volume and channel, and then we'll see if there are any other things we can add to it, like a volume button or something like that, or if there's anything else we can do to make it easier for people to understand what's going on. We need to find a way to integrate the different functions into one remote control, so that it doesn't get in the way of the user's workflow, and it's easier for them to use it. We also need to decide whether or not to include a button for the volume or not, and we also have to decide if we want to add a power button to the remote, or whether it should be on or off, and if it should have a volume slider or not. marketing: Well, one one way I would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types, so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. user Interface: I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and I would like to ask you guys for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting. So I can I can say already, I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of redundancy in the in the the issues and the the the things. So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how could we incorporate it and what we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by speaking to the industrial designer, we could decide whether it was worth investing in a new remote control or if it was a waste of money.",
    "The Industrial Designer suggested using a battery for the remote control, but the Project Manager pointed out that it would be expensive, and the Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of having a small battery, as it would reduce the size of the remote and reduce the cost of the product. The Project Manager agreed, and suggested that the remote should be small enough to fit in a purse or purse, and that it should be easy to carry around. The Industrial Designer also suggested a simple design, with a simple and simple design that would be easily accessible and easy to use. The project manager agreed to the idea of using a single-button design, as long as it was not too bulky. The industrial designer also suggested the use of a battery that could be placed in the middle of the device, as the remote would be easier to hold and easier to use, and it would allow for easy access to the remote. However, the project manager emphasized the need for a battery to be small and light, as well as the need to be able to change the battery size, as they would have to be placed on a flat surface. They also discussed the possibility of making the remote with an LCD screen, but ultimately decided to go with a flat screen, as this would be the easiest way to display the remote's functions. The User Interface team agreed to use the LCD screen for the user interface and the industrial designer agreed to design the remote for the User Interface, as there was no need for an LCD display. The team discussed the feasibility of using the remote as a power source, with the idea that it could be used to turn on and off the TV, but they ultimately decided against this option because it would cost too much money. The user interface team agreed that it was a good idea to use an LCD for the power supply, as LCDs are more expensive than LCDs, and they could be easily hidden from view. The group also agreed to incorporate a battery into the remote to reduce costs, as a result of which they were able to reduce the amount of money they had to pay for the battery and increase the battery life. They decided to use triple A batteries, as these were the most cost-effective and would last for a longer period of time than the regular batteries.",

I'm talking about billions and billions, and we have a lot of data, and I think we can get to the point where we have enough data to generate something, and then we can analyze it and see if there are any differences between the two, and if there is a difference between the one and the other, or if there's a difference in the two or if it's the same. grad e: It would be interesting to see if we could find a way to get the system to understand the context of the speech, or whether it would have to do something different from what we were doing, but it would still be possible.",

However, we are aware that there are a number of challenges facing the sector, such as the lack of funding for apprenticeships and the potential impact on the Welsh economy, so we need to make sure that we are prepared for these challenges. We are also looking at the impact on Welsh universities and apprenticeship provision, as well as the role of the European social fund, which is currently being funded by the Welsh Government. We have been in discussions with the Department for Exiting the European Union, and the Joint Ministerial Committee, and they have agreed to work closely with us to ensure a smooth transition to a post-Brexit Wales. We will continue to work with the Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams AM, to address these issues, and I would like to thank them for their work. Kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Suzy, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to us.

The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be made of plastic or rubber, and that the buttons should be shaped to fit into the shape of the user's hand. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a power button on the right side, as well as the idea of using a battery to power the remote, but the team decided to go with a battery-powered remote instead, as they believed that a battery would be more energy-efficient and less expensive than a battery powered remote control. The project manager also suggested the use of solar power, as it would reduce the cost of the product, and it would allow the team to produce the remote in a less expensive way. They also suggested using a different material for the power button, as there are many different materials that could be used for different purposes, such as titanium, titanium, carbon fiber, and titanium, and they also considered using a variety of materials for the buttons, including rubber, plastic, and plastic, but they ultimately decided to focus on the rubber and plastic for the rubber, as the rubber was more durable than the titanium. The group discussed the feasibility of incorporating an integrated circuit into the remote and decided to use a combination of capacitive and capacitive capacitive chips, which would allow for the remote to be placed in different shapes and sizes. The Industrial Designer suggested using the capacitive chip for the microphone, while the Project Manager suggested using capacitive technology for the speaker and the User Interface suggested incorporating a light-emitting diode for the battery, which could be placed on the left side of the device. The User Interface team agreed to the idea, as long as it was not too expensive. The Project Manager proposed using a solar powered remote, as he felt that it was more cost-effective than using batteries, but it would require a lot of energy to power it.",

They also discussed the need for a new type of remote control to be unique to the market, as they were concerned about the cost of the product, which was discussed in detail by the marketing team. The project manager also mentioned the importance of having a unique remote control design, as it was important for them to be able to sell the product to a wide range of people. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a variety of functions into the remote, such as the ability to control the television, and how the remote could be used for different purposes, like playing music, turning on the TV, adjusting volume, and controlling the volume, among other functions. The industrial designer also mentioned that the remote would have to be environmentally friendly and environmentally friendly, and that it needed to be easy to clean and easy to use. The marketing team also suggested the addition of a battery to the remote to reduce the amount of time needed to charge the device, and they also suggested that the device should be battery-powered, as there was a risk of overheating due to its size and weight. The Industrial Designer mentioned that it was difficult to find a battery for the remote due to the size of the device and that they had to buy a new battery for it, but they were confident that they could replace it with a new one. The Project Manager mentioned that they were aware of the fact that there was no guarantee that the product would be successful, but the team was confident in their ability to deliver on their promise. The group agreed to meet again in a couple of weeks to discuss the project, and it was decided that the team would meet again at the end of the year to finalize the project.",

User Interface: Yeah I think they'll like it, they'll love it and they'll be really happy with it. user interface: and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want. marketing: We have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And we have to make sure that it's not too hard to use because we want it to be easy to hold and easy to understand, but we also want to make it easy to lose, so we need to be able to easily replace it if it gets lost.

And then it was something about, some and then somebody said \" yeah, it does seem like, you know, C - zero is the one that 'ds, the major one \" or, s I can't remember exactly what it was now. Phd c and professor b discussed the idea of using the on - line normalization for speech, with the idea that it would reduce the amount of noise in the speech and increase the frequency, and the idea was discussed that the on-line normalization could be used to improve the quality of speech recognition.

    "Hefin david am: So, in your report, the 'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that 'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth? julie morgan am: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it's really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. sian gwenllian am: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014? jo-anne daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded. lynne neagle am: I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue?",

    "Phd b: I think it would be a good idea for us to use the PDA mike as a low - pass filter because it would allow us to reduce the amount of noise that we have to deal with, and it would give us a lot more control over the frequency of the sound, and we would be able to get a much more accurate signal, and also have a much higher level of accuracy. We would like to have a good understanding of how the sound is coming in and out of the room, as well as how it interacts with the microphone, and then we can use that information to adjust the filter accordingly. We also discussed the possibility of adding a filter to the system to filter out the noise, and the idea of using a filter filter was brought up by the professor. He also suggested using a low-pass filter, but the idea was quickly dismissed by Phd b, who pointed out that it was a waste of money to use a filter that would only filter out a small portion of the noise and not the whole thing. The idea of a filter was also raised by Professor A, who explained that it would take a lot of time and effort to implement it, and that it might not be possible to do it in a short amount of time, but that it could be done in the future. The professor also suggested that the filter should be based on the speech frequency, as it would reduce the number of times a person would have to say, \"I don't know, I don't think I want to talk about it,\" when they're in a room, but it would still be interesting to see how it would affect their speech.

The project manager proposed that the button should be placed on the top, as it would make it easy to see and easier to reach. The group also discussed how to integrate the remote into the user's home, with user interface stating that it was important for the remote to have a variety of colors and shapes to appeal to different types of users, including those with different tastes and those who prefer a more traditional look. The marketing team suggested that they would like to incorporate a number of different colours into the remote, such as orange, red, blue, purple, yellow, pink, and green, with different shapes and sizes, while the project manager suggested using different colours and shapes for the buttons. The Industrial Designer suggested using a different color for each channel, with orange being the most popular, followed by red and blue, and purple being the least popular. The User Interface team proposed the addition of a special button for the volume button, which could be used to turn the remote on or off, while marketing suggested adding a button for volume, which would be used for volume control. The Project Manager agreed to the idea, but the User Interface expressed concerns about the cost, as they believed that the cost would be too high for a simple remote control.",

The project manager also mentioned the possibility of incorporating a remote control with a voice recognition feature, as the current remote control doesn't have this feature, but the Industrial Designer believed that this would be a good idea, as they would be able to recognize the name of the brand and the logo, and it would make it easier for people to find the remote. The Project Manager also mentioned that they would like to incorporate a speech recognition feature in the remote to help the user understand what's going on, and they would also like to include a microphone for the voice recognition, so that the user can speak to the remote without having to hold it in their hand. They also discussed the idea of a remote with a microphone on the right side of the device, which would allow them to talk to the TV, but they were unable to find it, so they decided to keep it on the left side. The User Interface team discussed the need for a new remote control that would be user-friendly, with the idea that it should be easy to find and easy to use, and that it shouldn't be too complicated, but it should still have a lot of buttons. The Marketing Expert also suggested that it be possible to integrate the remote into a cup-holder, as long as it was not too expensive, as there were only a few buttons on it and it could be easily accessible from a distance. Marketing also suggested incorporating a speaker in the place-holder to help with the speech recognition, which was agreed upon by the Marketing Expert and the Project Manager. The team agreed to incorporate the speaker into the remote as a part of the new remote, and marketing also suggested using a microphone to communicate with the T_V_ through Bluetooth, as this would make the remote easier to understand and easier to use. And the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a T-V_ or a stereo or something, and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared, so if you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too, and so in order to receive the signals from what's on T_TV_ and such, you would have to spend more money and time to build a receiver. Marketing: Yeah, but I think that's a good thing, and I think it's important for the marketing team to make sure that they have enough money to cover the costs of the receiver, so we can afford it.",

Industrial designer: Yeah, I think we can make it bigger, but we need to make sure that it doesn't get in the way of other people's hands. User Interface: Okay, so we're going to have to change the shape of the remote to make it easier for people to hold it, and we'll have to find a new shape for it. Industrial Designer: We're not sure about the shape, but the idea is that it should be a little bit different, but not too different. Project Manager: So we're gonna go with the idea of making it look like a banana, and then we'll make it into a fruit. The project manager suggested that the remote should be made out of plastic, and the industrial designer suggested that it could be made of a variety of fruit shapes, including broccoli, strawberries, mango, mangoes, and strawberries. The team discussed the possibility of making the remote with different sizes and shapes, but ultimately settled on a single-curved shape for the base, which would make it easy to hold. They also discussed the need for a more advanced remote control, which was suggested by industrial designer, who suggested making it into an iPod-like shape, with a rubber band around the base to hold the remote in place. The industrial designer proposed that the buttons should be shaped like a triangle, and that the button should be placed in the middle of the device, with the power button on the left and the volume button in the center on the right. The group discussed the feasibility of incorporating a battery into the remote, with industrial designer suggesting that the battery should be small enough to fit in the remote's case, while user interface suggested using a battery case for the remote.",

However, if it were to use a different language, it wouldn't be possible to train on the same language, because it would be too hard to differentiate between the two languages. Phd a: I think it's a good idea to have a multilingual model, because we have a lot of different languages, and we want to make sure that we have enough different languages to cover all of them. professor b: But but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another, does that is that improve things i c in comparison?, my assump From what I saw from the earlier results, I guess last week, was that, if you trained on one Language and tested on another, say, that the results were were relatively poor. You have the same number of parameters in the neural net, and maybe there's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set.. That's interesting because it it seems like what it's saying is not so much that you got hurt because you didn't have so much representation of English, because in the other case you don't get hurt any more, at least when it seemed like it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse, phd A: I wonder were all three of these nets using the same output output?

    "The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to prioritize the creation of a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction, policy and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive mental health care services, which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period. They also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. They ask the government to work with the provinces to find a strategy to jointly allow for the delivery of this life-saving medicine to Canadians across the country and to take a leadership role in negotiating a price for gene modulators throughout all the provinces of Canada. Petitioners in my community point out in this petition, which, of course, predates the pandemic, that the family doctor shortage is severe in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia. It also, they cite, would pose risks to native fish stocks, pollute coastal ecosystems, impair at-risk wild Atlantic salmon, and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations. The petitioners ask the Prime Minister to ensure that every Canadian has access to a family doctor, and to ensure the availability of affordable and accessible health care for all Canadians. The Prime Minister is committed to meeting the needs of all Canadians, regardless of their age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or disability, and he has committed to ensuring that all Canadians receive the support they need. The government is also committed to addressing the issue of the lack of access to health care in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. They note that the use of the phrase military-style assault rifle is purely political posturing as the term is undefined in Canadian law, and they also draw attention to the numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation, including the fact that there is no definition of the term \"military-style\" in the Criminal Code and that it is undefined. They point out that the government has not been able to determine whether or not there is a need for a specific amount of money to be spent on the implementation of this program. They call on the prime minister to take immediate and decisive action to address this issue. They are also calling for a review of the government\u2019s decision to create a national program for the legalization of military style assault rifles, as they believe that there are currently no regulations in place to regulate these types of weapons.",
    "The Project Manager and the Industrial Designer presented the idea of a remote control that could be used to control the television, and the User Interface presented a concept for the remote control, with the idea that it would be able to interact with the television in a variety of different shapes and sizes. The Project Manager suggested that the user interface design should be based on the shape of the remote, and suggested that it should be shaped like a human, and that the remote should have a different shape depending on the user's preference. The Industrial Designer proposed that the project manager should design the remote with a unique shape and a unique color scheme, but the Project Manager disagreed with this idea, stating that the design should not be too different from the standard remote control and that it shouldn't be too similar to the regular remote control. The User Interface team agreed with this assessment, and they decided to focus on the design of the device, with a focus on making the remote more user-friendly and more comfortable for the user. They also decided to design a remote that would be easy to use and easy to understand, with an easy-to-use design that would appeal to a wide range of users. The project manager also suggested the use of a different material for the design, as it was easier to incorporate into the design than the other materials, such as rubber or plastic. The industrial designer suggested using rubber as the material, as this would be more durable and more durable than plastic, and it would allow the user to easily adjust the shape and size of the product. The user interface team agreed, but they were concerned about the cost of the project, as they believed that the cost would be too high for a device of this size. However, they were confident that the price would be reasonable, as long as they were able to make a profit on the project. User Interface agreed with the team regarding the cost, as well as the price, and agreed that they would be willing to pay more money for the product if they had to.",
    "The team discussed the various features of the remote control, such as the buttons for multiple operations, the presence of an LCD screen, the microphone position, and the microphone, as well as the shape and size of the buttons, which were discussed in detail, with the industrial designer stating that the buttons would be placed on the left and right sides of the device, while the project manager emphasized the importance of having the buttons on the right side, as it would be easier for the user to reach them. The project manager also mentioned the possibility of incorporating a push-button on the remote, which would allow users to control the remote by pressing a button, but the team was not sure if this would be a good idea or not, as the button would be too small and would be difficult to reach. The team also discussed the idea of a remote control with an LCD display, which could be used to display the user's preferences, and they discussed the feasibility of incorporating the buttons into the remote itself, as they would be able to be placed in different shapes and sizes. The industrial designer mentioned that they would like to incorporate a push button on the side of the screen, as this would make it easier for users to reach the buttons and it would reduce the cost of the product. The marketing team also suggested the inclusion of a microphone, which was discussed in depth, and it was decided that the microphone should be placed at the top of the display, so that it would not interfere with the user when the remote was being used, and that it could be positioned in different positions depending on the location of the button. The Industrial Designer also suggested that the remote should have a microphone on the front, as there was a possibility of placing it in a different position depending on what the user wanted to do with the remote. The Marketing Expert also suggested incorporating a microphone in the remote as well, and suggested that it should be positioned at the center of the TV screen, so it could also be used for voice recognition.

    "The government has recognized the importance of the tourism industry in Canada's economy, and it is important to recognize the challenges faced by the tourism sector in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. They provide hundreds of billions of dollars worth of services to commercial agricultural crops and other ecological services every year, and the European Union has put heavy restrictions on the chemicals that are affecting them, the neonicotinoids. This petition calls on the Government of Canada, for the sake of bees and our food security, to follow Europe's lead and adhere to the precautionary principle by banning the use of pesticides in Canada. It raises big questions about the choices facing seniors in certain situations, which is what makes this first petition particularly timely. I am tabling a petition related to Bill C-7, the government's euthanasia bill, which seeks to dramatically remove safeguards that the government said were vital only a short time ago. When some people are living in deplorable conditions, we cannot truly speak of them as having a choice of when they ought to die. Especially in light of that new information, I commend this petition for the consideration of members of the House. The second petition is in support of Bill S-204 on organ harvesting and trafficking, put forward in the Senate. The bill would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ without the donor's consent. It relates to what I think many of us will regard as the real heroes of the last few months. In this pandemic, there have often been very underpaid and overworked front-line workers who receive minimum wage and nothing more, and who are of course deemed essential services. The petitioners have asked the government to implement a wage supplement as a temporary measure to bring the wages for those who are in contact with the general public and working in what has been deemed an essential service to no less than $20 an hour, in terms of their service and the risks they're taking for all of us. She said that when we present petitions, we are simply supposed to give one or two sentences before putting them on the table. the chair: I want to remind honourable members that when they are presenting petitions, they should be very concise with the prcis that they give up front, as opposed to going on for a long time. Now we will proceed to statements by members for a period not exceeding 15 minutes, and each statement will be for one minute.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the idea of incorporating voice recognition into the remote control, with the industrial designer suggesting that it would be easier for users to use the remote than buttons, and the project manager agreed to incorporate it into the design of the remote. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition chip, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice, as well as the ability to activate the remote by pressing a button. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be able to recognize the user's voice, and that it should be easy to use, as long as there are no buttons on it. The project manager also suggested that there should be five buttons on the remote, as they are easier to find and easier to use than buttons on a traditional remote control. However, the team agreed that there was a need for a more complex design, as it would take a lot of time and money to produce a remote with five buttons. The team also agreed that it was important to incorporate a voice-activated remote control into the product, as there was no way of knowing whether or not it would work without a button on it, and they would need to find a way to incorporate the remote into the device. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to have five buttons, but I don't know if it's practical to include them all at once or not, but it's important to have them all on the same side of the device, so they can be easily accessible. The idea of having five buttons is appealing to the user, but there's no guarantee that it will work, and it's not practical to incorporate them all in the same remote, so the team will have to decide whether they want to use them separately or combine them together. Industrial Designer: We'll have to figure out the best way to integrate them all together, but we're confident that we can integrate them together, and I think we can do it in a way that doesn't cost too much.. I su i if given that the the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before, th th the double risk, perhaps we ought to stick to to buttons, since the last thing we want to do is present a product with a double risk of double risk, but we need to be careful not to over complicate things..

However, the team realized that they would have to do a lot of work to get it up and running, so they decided to focus on a single transcriber instead of having two. They also decided to use a speech-recognition algorithm to generate the speech signal, which would be used for transcribing the speech. The group discussed the idea of using speech recognition as a way to improve the quality of the voice signal, with a focus on speech recognition, as well as incorporating speech recognition into the speech recognition. They discussed the importance of having a voice recognition algorithm that could be used to generate speech, and discussed the need for a speech recognizer that would have the ability to recognize speech in a variety of languages, including English, German, Spanish, Italian, and Spanish. The research team decided to incorporate speech recognition technology into the system, and they discussed the potential for the system to use speech recognition in a number of different languages, such as English, French, and German. The researchers also discussed how they could implement speech recognition with the help of speech recognition software, including the use of voice recognition and speech recognition algorithms. They agreed that speech recognition would be the most effective way to achieve the goal of generating speech recognition for speech, with speech recognition being the most efficient way to do it. Additionally, speech recognition was discussed, and it was agreed that the team would need to find a way for speech recognition to be more efficient, as speech recognition is more expensive than speech recognition due to the time it takes to produce speech.",

But if we were to use it, we would have to have the right amount of time to train the system, and it would take a long time to get it up and running, so it might not be feasible to train it on a large number of people at once, but if we could do it over a longer period of time, then it wouldn't be too much of a problem., you're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation, but because you have these non - causal windows, you're getting these funny things coming in, at n And, what if you did?, there's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to getting it back to the original, according to some equation., so this, This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost, a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case. So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio. And I think there's a possibility that this could be a good way to improve the quality of the signal, because if you have a good signal - to - noise ratio, you can get a better signal-to-noise ratio.",
    ", but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using, the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we had been using, was that the Aurora system had a lot of noise, whereas the SRI system had less noise, but it was a lot less noise. professor b: But if you had a a really big training set, a recognizer, system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we're using the configuration we ''re using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora, we have all those parameters just set as they are., so, if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters, and if you, have the natural room, which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio, then in that case, the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation. But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as, the convolutional kind of things we were doing. phd a: I think it would be a good idea for us to have a group of people in the group to work on this because it would give them a chance to experiment with different types of filters.",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on Free School-Meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free school-meal counterparts. One of the things that they have done is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school, and they've trained all the teachers in it, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate impact on those children, and we have seen that the impact has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. llyr gruffydd am: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is?

    "The User Interface team presented a prototype of the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that it should be made of plastic, and the Project Manager suggested that the design should be based on the shape of the human hand, with buttons on the left and right sides of the device, and that the user should be able to hold it in their hands. The Industrial Designer proposed that the remote should be shaped like a flower or a plant, as it would be easier to hold and easier to use. The Project Manager agreed, and suggested that it could be used in a variety of scenarios, such as as a remote control for the phone, a remote for the television, a speaker, or a speakerphone, and a speaker for the TV. However, the Industrial Design team suggested that they would need to make the device more ergonomic, as they would have to adjust the design to the user's hand size and shape. The industrial designer suggested that there should be a button on the right side of the case to control the volume, while the project manager proposed that it be placed in the middle of the body, with a button at the top for the volume and another on the bottom for the power button. They also suggested making the buttons on both sides to be interchangeable, as well as adding a speaker to the left side, which would be used for volume control. The project manager agreed to this idea, as long as it was not too expensive, but the industrial designer expressed concern about the cost of the product, as he felt that the cost would be too high for a device of this size and complexity. The team agreed that it would not be too expensive if the product were to be sold as a fashion accessory, but they did not want to make it too expensive for people to have to pay extra money for it.",
    "The Industrial Designer and Project Manager discussed the design of the remote, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that the design should be based on the user's personal preferences, and the Project Manager suggested that the remote should have a unique look and feel, while the User Interface suggested that it should be comfortable to hold and easy to use. The Industrial Designer also suggested that there should be a special case for the remote and that the case should be made out of plastic, as it would be easy to handle. The Project Manager proposed that the user should be able to change the color of the case to match their personal preference, and that they could easily change the shape of the buttons to suit their personal preferences. The User Interface team also suggested the addition of a voice recognition feature, which would allow the user to control the volume, volume, and volume with their voice, as well as the ability to adjust the brightness, contrast, and brightness of the screen. The project manager also proposed the inclusion of a speech recognition feature that would allow users to speak to the remote through speech recognition, and suggested that a microphone should be included in the remote to help with the voice recognition. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker in the case, which was agreed upon by the industrial designer and the user interface team. Marketing also suggested incorporating a microphone into the case and the project manager agreed to include a microphone on the front of the device. The industrial designer also suggested adding a speaker to the case as well, as he felt that it would make it easier for people to use the remote in the future.",
    "Members of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic have raised concerns about the lack of adequate funding for the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as a lack of support for front-line workers in the wake of the pandemic. However, the government has allocated $75 million to address the issue of sexual exploitation and human trafficking, with the aim of reducing the number of people who fall prey to these crimes. The government has also allocated $25 million to the Ministry of Public Health and Emergency Preparedness to address this issue, and the Minister of National Defence has pledged to provide additional funding to address it. The Minister of Public Security has also pledged to ensure the safety of all Canadians, including those who have been affected by the virus, and to ensure that there are adequate measures in place to ensure their safety. In addition, the Minister has committed to ensuring the safety and security of Canadians in the event of a pandemic outbreak, and he has also committed to providing support to those who are affected by it. He has also promised to work closely with the provinces and territories to ensure a safe and secure environment for all Canadians. This is a very important initiative, and I look forward to seeing the results of this initiative in the coming months. I would like to express my appreciation for this initiative and thank the Minister for his leadership and support for this important initiative.",
    "Phd c: So he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcribers thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number, a digit, and then a Beep, at the beginning of each one professor f: Yeah. And, so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style, beeps phd g: Where 'd you get the digits from? phd d: and so we're I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten. Professor f: And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they ''ll be doing, how long they 'll be doing it, and so forth, because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working. And so, we're going to have to figure out a way to make it easier for them to understand what they're saying and what they want to say, and we're gonna have to do it in a different way than we did before, but it's going to be interesting to see how it goes. We'll see if we can get it up and running in a month or two, but we'll have to wait until the end of the year to see if it's worth it.",
    "User Interface: I think it would be a good idea to have a button on the right side of the remote control, but I don't think it's practical to have it on the left side, so I think we should go with the left. user interface: the thing is we do need to develop our technology of actually how to program the menus and what sort of, you know, text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen, marketing: This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation, and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department. This one has no obvious connections to fruit, but because it's round and molded, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchy-feely, kiddie, it's more like yeah, you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one, which I quite like that sort of image. user Interface: So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two marketing: Yeah. User Interface: That isn't that is more curved, like a banana, but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana, with the grooves and the stalk and stuff, Marketing: As a banana. marketing: And of the two I really like I m I like the banana, project manager: The chunk.

    "dafydd evans: I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. Nick brazil: Could I add to that? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world, so, there are plenty of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the meantime, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh Bac is one one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college. sian gwenllian am: So, do we get rid of it? lynne neagle am: You don't need to answer that.

    "User interface: We have a lot of ideas for the remote control, but we're not sure if we're going to be able to implement them all at once or if we'll have to tweak them in the future. Industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to have two buttons on the back of the remote, one for volume and one for power, and the other for volume. User Interface: It would be nice to have a volume button on the right side, but I don't think it's practical to have it on the left side. Industrial Designer: I'm not sure about that, but the idea of having two buttons is appealing to me, so I'm willing to give it a try. We'll see if it works, and if it doesn't, we'll adjust it later on. user interface: Yeah, I think we're gonna have to adjust it, but it's going to work, and I think that it's gonna be interesting to see how people react to it. industrial designer: Yeah I think they're gonna like it, and they'll like it a lot, and we'll see what they like about it. We're gonna see if they like it or not, and then we'll decide whether or not they want to buy it, or if they just want to get rid of it. User interface: Okay, we have to make sure that we have enough buttons for all the different functions, because we want it to work for everyone, and it's important for people to be comfortable with it. The project manager: We want to make it affordable, we want to sell it to people who want to use it, so we're looking for a price point where it's affordable, but not too expensive. We want people to have the option to upgrade to a different model if they don't want to pay for a new model, but if they do, they can still use the old model and still have the same functionality.",

The Project Manager also mentioned the importance of a new design for the remote control, stating that the current remote control was too expensive, and that they needed to find a way to make it more affordable. The User Interface User Interface team agreed with the project manager's assessment that the new design would be more affordable, and suggested that the project should be based on the user's preferences, with a focus on design and user-friendliness. However, the Industrial Designer expressed concerns about the cost of the project due to the cost and complexity of the design, as well as the lack of a user interface. The Industrial Designer also expressed concern about the price of the product, as it would have to be more expensive than a normal remote control and it would require a lot of time and money to produce. The project manager agreed that the price would be too high, as they would need to make the product more expensive, but they were confident that the product would be able to meet the demand for the price. The Marketing team also expressed concerns over the cost, as there was a lack of information about the product design, and they were concerned about the quality and quality of the remote controls, as compared to the standard remote controls currently available in the market. Additionally, the Marketing team emphasized the need to create a new type of remote control for the market, as the existing remote controls were too expensive and they did not have the necessary features to meet demand. The team agreed that a new model would be needed for the next project, and it was decided that the team would design a new version of the original remote control in the next meeting.",

The project manager agreed, but User Interface expressed concerns about the cost of the new remote control due to the lack of budget and the need for an advanced chip, which would require a lot of money. User Interface also expressed concerns over the cost and complexity of the project, as they had not been able to design a remote control that was easy to use and easy to understand, and they were unsure about how to make it more user-friendly than a standard remote control. The team decided to focus on creating a simple and simple remote control with a simple look and feel, with the aim of making it easy to find and easy-to-use. The user interface suggested a simple design that would be simple to use, with buttons on either the left or right sides of the display, and a scroll wheel with buttons for the volume, volume, and volume buttons. The industrial designer proposed that the buttons should be placed in the middle of the device, and the project Manager agreed, as long as they were placed in a place where they could be easily reachable. The marketing team suggested that they would like to incorporate a speech recognition function into the remote, as it would be easier for the user to understand what was going on, and it would make it easier for them to use the remote. However, User Interface pointed out that there was a lack of information about what was needed for the speech recognition, as there was no information about how many buttons needed to be placed on the remote and only one button needed for each channel, and there were only two buttons for volume and on-off.",

The Project Manager agreed with this view, and suggested that it be possible to make the remote more powerful, as long as it was not too expensive, and that it should not be too heavy or bulky. The User Interface Team agreed with the idea, as they felt that the product should be easily replaceable, but they were concerned about the cost of the product and the need for a higher-end model, as well as the possibility of having to pay more money for a different model. However, they were confident that they could produce the product at a cost of fifteen Euros per unit, which would allow them to cater to a wide range of price points, including a price of twenty-five Euros for the basic model and twenty-eight Euros for a more expensive model. The project manager agreed to this, and the Marketing team agreed to increase the price of the device to fifteen Euros, with a price range of fifteen to twenty-seven Euros, and a price point of fifty Euros.

    "The House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic has been working closely with the Ministry of Public Health and Emergency Preparedness to provide support to those affected by the coronavirus pandemic, including providing support to front-line workers who have been impacted by the pandemic. They provide hundreds of billions of dollars worth of services to commercial agricultural crops and other ecological services every year, and the European Union has put heavy restrictions on the chemicals that are affecting them, the neonicotinoids. This petition calls on the Government of Canada, for the sake of bees and our food security, to follow Europe's lead and adhere to the precautionary principle by banning the use of toxic pesticides in Canada. It raises big questions about the choices facing seniors in certain situations, which is what makes this first petition particularly timely. I am tabling a petition related to Bill C-7, the government's euthanasia bill, which seeks to dramatically remove safeguards that the government said were vital only a short time ago. When some people are living in deplorable conditions, we cannot truly speak of them as having a choice of when they ought to die. Especially in light of that new information, I commend this petition for the consideration of members of the House. The second petition is in support of Bill S-204 on organ harvesting and trafficking, put forward in the Senate. The bill would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ without the donor's consent. It relates to what I think many of us will regard as the real heroes of the last few months. It has been a difficult time for the people of the province, and I would like to recognize the work of the Canadian Coast Guard auxiliary members and the Department of National Defence and Provincial Airlines, as well as the efforts of the Minister of Public Services and Procurement, who have worked tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of Canadians during this difficult time.",

The project manager suggested that they could easily adjust the price of the device to fit into the budget of the company, but they were unsure if they could afford to do so. They decided to focus on making the product more affordable, and decided to sell it at a price of twenty-five Euros instead of thirty-five euros. The group decided to use the D_V_D_ player as a base for their remote, as the price would be less expensive than the average price of a television set, and it would allow them to invest in a new product.",
