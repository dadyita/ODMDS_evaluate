        "In the meeting, the decision was made to try to have the system ready for the DARPA meeting in mid-July. The team discussed the progress on the transcription interface and the need for a mock-up of a question answering system. They also discussed the need for more transcribers and the organization of the meeting data.\n\nIn terms of the paper, it was about the amount of overlap in different corpora, including the Meeting Recorder meetings, the Robustness meetings, Switchboard, and CallHome. The paper included statistics on the number of overlapping words and spurts of speech in each corpus. They found that the Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap, followed by Switchboard and CallHome, and the Robustness meetings had the least amount of overlap. It was also noted that two-party telephone conversations had similar levels of overlap as face-to-face meetings.",
        "During the meeting, the decision was made to send the EDU meetings to IBM for transcription, focusing on the dominant speakers and excluding background laptop sounds. The transcribers would mark the start and end points of the dominant speakers, and any misclassification of speech as nonspeech would be noted. The aim was to generate a flood of data that could be useful when it comes back from IBM. It was suggested that a sample of the meetings should be listened to before sending them to IBM to ensure the accuracy of the speech-nonspeech detection. The statistics from previous meetings indicated that the speech-nonspeech detector had an error rate of around 1% for good meetings, with potential higher error rates for meetings with more background noise. The paper discussed the results of the detection system and the impact of overlaps on recognition performance."
