        "During the meeting, there was a discussion on resource implications related to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Julie Morgan, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, expressed the view that the Bill is not addressing child abuse, but rather aiming to protect children's rights by prohibiting all forms of physical punishment. She acknowledged that people have different views on this issue and emphasized the importance of hearing those views through the consultation process. Morgan also highlighted that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognizes that any physical punishment of children, no matter how minor, is incompatible with their human rights.\n\nIn terms of unforeseen costs, Julie Morgan explained that the legislation would not create a new offense but rather remove a defense to an offense of common assault. She mentioned that the implementation group, which includes representatives from various agencies, is working on addressing issues related to implementation and resource implications. The group has set up four work streams to address parenting advice and support, data collection and evaluation, operations and procedures, and out-of-court disposals and diversions.\n\nKaren Cornish, the deputy director of the children and families division, added that the effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs), although they can be helpful in facilitating joint working between agencies. She mentioned that there are currently MASHs in certain areas but acknowledged that their effectiveness may vary. Cornish also noted that the implementation group is considering how agencies can work together in a consistent and appropriate way, and the effectiveness of MASH arrangements in Wales will be reviewed by a multi-agency strategic group.\n\nRegarding the impact on social services, Julie Morgan recognized that social workers are already stretched and that their workload could potentially increase with the implementation of the Bill. However, she mentioned that there is no expectation of a significant rise in referrals to social services. She referred to the evidence given by Jane Randall, the National Independent Safeguarding Board representative, who stated that there will likely be a small number of referrals but that it would be manageable within existing resources. Morgan emphasized the importance of ongoing monitoring and evaluation to assess the impact of the legislation and ensure that social services have the necessary support and resources.\n\nThe issue of teacher readiness was also discussed, and Julie Morgan stated that the education sector is represented on the implementation group through the Association of Directors of Education in Wales. She mentioned that teachers already receive training on childcare legislation and that the training related to the Bill could be incorporated into existing training programs. When asked about the cost of training, Morgan suggested that it could be minimal as it would likely be absorbed into the current training budget.\n\nOverall, the discussion highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation, the importance of collaboration between agencies, and the consideration of additional support and resources to ensure effective implementation of the Bill.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications was summarized. Julie Morgan expressed the importance of a whole-school approach to mental health and well-being, creating an atmosphere where children can bring up any concerns they have with any trusted staff member. Hefin David questioned whether the information discussed in the meeting would be a surprise to teachers and trade unions, to which Julie Morgan explained that the issues being addressed are already part of their procedures and processes. Karen Cornish added that the Healthy Child Wales program and health visitors play a crucial role in promoting positive parenting and can benefit from the removal of the defense. However, concerns were raised about the low accessibility of the program for some parents. The discussion also touched on the potential impact on social services, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service, and the need for a public awareness campaign. The meeting ended with a discussion on human rights considerations and the potential for polarisation among the public. It was noted that while there is support for the Bill among parents with young children, there is opposition from some older individuals. The meeting concluded with a note to provide updates on out-of-court disposals, discussions with the Disclosure and Barring Service, and the cost of the awareness campaign."

        "During the meeting, it was discussed that the increase in exclusions from school can be attributed to several factors. One of the main factors mentioned was the prevalence of challenging behavior, particularly among students with additional learning needs such as autism spectrum disorder. The meeting participants acknowledged that there is a need for more capacity and resources to support these students effectively.\n\nIn terms of strategies for support and reintegration, it was mentioned that local authorities have developed behavior and well-being strategies that include tiered approaches to provide universal provision and more specialist support when needed.

The Minister also addressed questions on the legislation, specifically the inclusion of aspects related to the 'what matters' statements and the statutory framework for progression. The Minister emphasized the importance of equity in the curriculum and the ongoing reflection and refinement of the curriculum based on feedback. The meeting also touched on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) and the potential unintended consequences of the curriculum. The Minister acknowledged the value of WISERD's work and stated that equity and principles of equality have always driven the curriculum reform.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on assessment, progression, and accountability, with the Minister highlighting the need for ongoing professional learning and support for teachers.",
        "The discussions in the meeting focused on various aspects of education, including the integration of human rights into the curriculum, issues in special education and the recruitment of professional staff, challenges in training staff for special education, emphasis on the more able and talented stream, standards in special schools, and the trend of teacher recruiting along with the reasons and steps taken.\n\nRegarding the integration of human rights into the curriculum, the discussions highlighted the positive feedback received on the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment to support children's learning and progression. There was a suggestion to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment and to clarify definitions around formative and summative assessment. It was agreed that the primary purpose of assessment is to inform teachers on how to support a child's educational journey and that assessment methods and outcomes should be shared with parents.\n\nIn terms of special education, challenges were identified in recruiting professional staff and in providing appropriate training for them. It was acknowledged that there is a need to ensure that staff have the necessary skills and knowledge to support students with special needs. The discussions also touched on the importance of catering to the needs of more able and talented students and providing appropriate resources and support for their development.\n\nThe meeting also addressed the standards in special schools and the need to ensure that they meet the needs of all students.

        "The increase in exclusions from school can be attributed to various factors, including the prevalence of challenging behavior and additional learning needs, a lack of capacity in the system to provide appropriate support and provision, and pressures on schools to perform well in accountability measures. Local authorities have strategies in place to support and reintegrate learners at risk of exclusion or disengagement, including behavior and well-being strategies and tiered approaches to provision. However, there may be a lag in the system in fully implementing these strategies and ensuring consistent provision across all local authorities. School accountability measures may have an impact on exclusions, as there is pressure on schools to perform and meet targets, which can contribute to a culture that may not always prioritize individual student needs. However, efforts are being made to shift this focus and prioritize the well-being and progression of students. Local authorities also engage with parents through a team-around-the-family approach, bringing together various agencies to support families and address the underlying causes of challenging behavior. However, there may be variations in the extent to which local authorities have implemented this approach. Funding challenges can also impact exclusions, as schools may have to make difficult choices and prioritize resources, which can affect the provision for learners with additional learning needs. The implementation of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 may place additional pressure on the system and highlight the need for increased funding. The WLGA highlights the importance of considering the needs of staff in pupil referral units and ensuring that funding is provided for their training and support. The allocation of funding between local authorities and schools can also impact provision and may create difficulties in providing consistent support across different authorities.",
        "According to Samaritans and Mind Cymru, there is concern about the increasing number of children and young people being excluded from school. The main reasons for this increase are not fully understood, but there are indications that factors such as persistent disruptive behavior, verbal abuse, physical assaults, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may contribute to exclusions. The impact of early trauma and ACEs on children's mental health and well-being is a significant concern.\n\nSchools need to provide adequate support to pupils who are at risk of becoming excluded. This support should include a compassionate and informed response from all school staff, as well as a focus on the whole-school environment and the well-being of students. Training for teachers on understanding and responding to distress and suicidal thoughts is also important. Additionally, it is crucial to listen to the voices of young people themselves and involve them in decision-making processes.\n\nThe balance between funding for diagnosis and support is a complex issue. While diagnosis can be useful in understanding a child's needs and behaviors, it is not sufficient without proper support. Schools need to ensure that they provide appropriate support for all learners, regardless of whether they have an additional learning need or not. The focus should be on inclusion and creating a supportive environment for all students.\n\nThere is a need for greater awareness and understanding of the impact of early trauma and ACEs in schools. The whole-school approach, which considers the emotional and mental health well-being needs of students, is crucial. This approach should be supported by statutory guidance and integrated into the curriculum to ensure that students receive the necessary support and interventions. More research and data collection are needed to fully understand the current level of support provided in schools and EOTAS settings for mental health.",
        "The discussions on the new curriculum's integration of human rights focused on the need for a national understanding of best practices and how well they are being implemented. There was a concern that some schools may not be effectively integrating human rights into their curriculum, leading to uneven outcomes for students. The discussions also touched on the issues of special education and the recruitment of professional staff. It was noted that there are challenges in training staff for special education and that more needs to be done to support and equip teachers in this area. The emphasis on the more able and talented stream was also discussed, with a recognition that there is a need for better identification and support of these students, particularly those who are eligible for free school meals. The standards in special schools were also mentioned, with a call for more research and investigation into the reasons behind the baseline of young people being off-rolled from these schools. The trend of teacher recruiting was also discussed, with a focus on the need for proper training and support for teachers in dealing with mental health issues and providing emotional well-being support.",
        "During the meeting, several topics were discussed, including the integration of human rights in the new curriculum, issues in special education and recruitment of professional staff, challenges in training staff for special education, emphasis on the more able and talented stream, standards in special schools, and the trend of teacher recruitment.\n\nIn regards to the integration of human rights in the new curriculum, it was mentioned that there is a need for more information and evidence regarding attendance and looked-after children. It was also discussed that the pupil deprivation grant, which is primarily for looked-after children, should be spent on that specific group, but there were concerns about blurring the boundaries and not targeting the grant effectively.\n\nThe meeting also touched on the challenges in training staff for special education, particularly in relation to the PLASC data and the tracking of previously looked-after children who are now adopted. There were discussions about the need for better data collection and tracking systems to ensure proper support for this group of children.\n\nRegarding the recruitment of professional staff, it was noted that the Schools Challenge Cymru program had variable success, but overall showed improvements in the 40 schools involved. The length of time needed for such programs to be successful was also discussed, with suggestions that at least three years of implementation is necessary for proper evaluation.\n\nIn terms of special schools, it was highlighted that over 90% of special schools are considered good or better, with the remaining schools mainly dealing with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties. The collaboration and sharing of good practice among special schools was seen as a positive factor in their success.\n\nLastly, the issues surrounding local authorities and consortia were addressed. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of self-evaluation processes within local authorities and the need for better monitoring and evaluation of progress. The turnover of directors in local authorities and the need for consistent approaches across consortia were also discussed.\n\nOverall, the meeting covered a range of important topics related to education in Wales, highlighting both successes and challenges in various areas."

        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector were discussed in a meeting attended by David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, Deputy Chief Executive of HEFCW. They highlighted three main causes for the financial challenges: the impact of a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England and Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales, as the majority of UK universities are also facing financial challenges and taking cost-cutting measures. Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England due to pre-existing funding gaps. However, the introduction of the Diamond reforms, which increase funding for higher education in Wales, is seen as a positive step. The sector's performance in terms of national student survey results and research impact is also positive. The meeting also discussed the financial sustainability of the higher education sector, the reserves of universities, the role of governing bodies, and the need for collaboration between higher education and further education. In terms of research funding, concerns were raised about the lack of increase in QR funding and the potential impact of Brexit on research funding. The meeting also touched on the importance of transparency in reporting the use of fee income and the need for affordable accommodation for under-represented groups. Overall, the meeting provided insights into the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector and the efforts being made to address them.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are as follows:\n\n1. Impact of Brexit: The uncertainty surrounding the relationships and arrangements with Europe has had a significant impact on the higher education sector in Wales. This uncertainty affects areas such as EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding.\n\n2. Funding Position: The funding position is a major pressure for the Welsh higher education sector. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are being implemented, but the re-establishment of funding for Welsh institutions is expected to take some time. This funding is crucial for higher cost provision, innovation, and research funding.\n\n3. Student Recruitment: The sector is facing challenges in student recruitment, both from EU and non-EU students. The changes in student support arrangements for EU students have had an impact on their willingness to come to Wales. Additionally, the downturn in 18-year-old school-leavers and increased competition from English institutions are affecting student recruitment.\n\n4. Pay and Pension Costs: The sector is facing increased costs for pay and pensions, including issues with the universities superannuation scheme pension fund. These increased costs add financial pressure to the institutions.\n\n5. Expectations for Modern Facilities and Infrastructure: Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure require capital expenditure and borrowing, which adds financial pressures to the sector.\n\n6. Uncertainty about Fees and Funding Review: The uncertainty surrounding the review in England of fees and funding, known as the Augar review, adds to the financial challenges faced by Welsh higher education institutions.\n\nIn terms of addressing these challenges, the sector is working on promoting Wales as an attractive place to study, increasing marketing efforts, and strengthening partnerships with the Welsh and UK governments. The sector is also focusing on finding additional sources of funding, such as research funding from the charitable sector, and advocating for continued access to EU funding programs. The sector is also working on contingency plans and scenarios to ensure financial sustainability and protect student interests. However, the sector's ability to address these challenges depends on the clarity and stability of the political and funding landscape."

        "During the meeting, Dr. David Blaney, the chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, discussed the impact of Brexit on the higher education system in Wales. He mentioned that the uncertainty surrounding the relationship between the UK and the EU is one of the most significant issues facing universities in Wales. He highlighted the importance of EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding for the Welsh higher education sector. He also mentioned that there has been a decrease in EU students applying to study in Wales, as well as a decrease in non-EU international students. Dr. Blaney attributed this to changes in student support arrangements for EU students and the relative investment levels between Wales and England. He also mentioned that the Welsh higher education sector is facing pressures related to funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and the uncertainty surrounding the Augar review of fees and funding in England. He stated that the sector is preparing for various scenarios and that there is a need for increased capital investment to enhance competitiveness. Dr. Blaney also discussed the potential impact of Brexit on fee and access plans, as well as the need for continued collaboration and funding from research councils and the charitable sector. He emphasized the importance of maintaining the quality and impact of research in Wales and the need for clarity and support from the Welsh Government. Overall, Dr. Blaney expressed concern about the potential challenges and uncertainties that Brexit may bring to the Welsh higher education system and highlighted the importance of continued investment and support to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of the sector."

They believe that high-quality early childhood education and care can provide support for both parents' employment and the development of children. The current system is complex and needs to be simplified. The Welsh Government is working on pilot projects in eight local authorities to find ways to simplify and join up the system. They are also planning to make an announcement soon regarding the direction they want to take. The discussion also touched on the variation in early childhood education and care provision across different parts of Wales. The Welsh Government recognizes the need for greater consistency but acknowledges that there are reasons for the variation, such as historical differences in local authority approaches. They are working to develop a more integrated approach and ensure that standards are maintained through inspections and regulation by Estyn and CIW. The meeting also discussed the Welsh Government's efforts to support the Welsh language skills of the childcare and play workforce. They are working with the National Centre for Learning Welsh to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. In terms of the childcare offer, the evaluation of the first year showed limited impact due to the limited availability of the offer. The second evaluation is expected to provide more meaningful results. The evaluation also highlighted that the majority of respondents were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. The Welsh Government acknowledges this and is working to increase take-up and ensure that the offer is an incentive for parents to return to work. They are planning to extend the offer to parents in education and training and are reviewing the program to determine how to include them. The factors being considered include the need to encourage people back into work, cost, and avoiding duplication of existing support. The review will report early next year.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion revolved around the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them, as well as Julie Morgan's perspective on the matter. In regards to the issues with HMRC, it was mentioned that the budget process is ongoing and it is premature to say that any money has been secured for early years. However, it was acknowledged that early years is one of the eight priority areas for the government and they would expect to receive funding from Barnett consequentials. The decision to move away from HMRC was based on the desire for a more flexible approach and the ability to expand the childcare offer beyond what HMRC would allow. It was also mentioned that there were technical issues with HMRC's IT systems and their ability to comply with Welsh language standards. The decision to work with local authorities instead of HMRC was also influenced by the lower costs and the ability to retain investment in Wales. \n\nIn terms of the childcare offer, there was a discussion about the cost of moving to a child-centred approach where every child would have access to the offer. The exact cost is not known yet as it is part of a longer-term review. It was mentioned that there are approximately 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales and based on the current eligibility criteria, about 34,000 children are eligible for the offer. It was noted that the eligibility criteria is based on parents being in work, which means that half of the children are from non-working families. The committee raised concerns about whether three and four-year-olds are the right age group to target for child development, and it was mentioned that there is a review looking at the possibility of a universal offer. \n\nRegarding the Parent, Childcare and Employment Programme (PaCE), it was mentioned that the programme has been extended until June 2022 with additional ESF funding of \u00a35.6 million. The UK government has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, including the PaCE programme. However, there is uncertainty about funding beyond that date. \n\nMoving on to Flying Start, there was a discussion about the benefits and challenges of geographic targeting versus a mixed socioeconomic environment. It was mentioned that Flying Start currently reaches about 23% of children in Wales, and an estimated 45% of children in Flying Start areas are in poverty. The committee raised concerns about the take-up of the childcare offer in certain areas and the reasons for the drop in take-up. The reasons for the drop will be discussed in more detail in upcoming meetings. The committee also expressed concerns about the low percentage of parents attending parenting courses and asked about plans to encourage take-up. It was mentioned that parenting courses are just one aspect of parenting support and that support from health visitors and childcare providers also play a role in supporting parents. The committee also raised concerns about children who are still falling behind despite the support provided by Flying Start, and it was mentioned that longitudinal studies are being conducted to track children's progress and evaluate the"

        "The findings and concerns raised by WISERD research regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system were discussed in the meeting. The Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams, acknowledged that while the majority of schools are making well-thought-out and appropriate decisions regarding the targeting of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG), there is still room for improvement. The use of PDG is evolving over time, with schools becoming more aware of how to effectively deploy the funding. Williams highlighted the importance of leadership in schools and the role of PDG regional advisers in promoting best practices and consistency. She also recognized the need for flexibility in eligibility criteria and the possibility of longer-term projections of funding allocations. Williams stated that the PDG should be used to address the specific needs of students, including more able and talented students, and to support interventions that have a disproportionate effect on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The impact of PDG on attendance and engagement was discussed, with examples given of schools using PDG to implement interventions such as growth mindset training and walking buses to improve attendance. The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged that there is still work to be done in reducing the attainment gap for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but highlighted that progress has been made in narrowing the gap in previous years. She emphasized the need for a more sophisticated performance measurement system that takes into account individual progress and value-added by schools. The Cabinet Secretary also addressed concerns about the widening attainment gap in 2017 and stated that further analysis and discussions with exam boards will be conducted to understand the factors contributing to this trend. Regarding PDG for looked-after children, Williams acknowledged that there is less awareness of this funding compared to PDG for free school meals. She explained that PDG for looked-after children is held at a regional level and is intended to be strategically deployed to drive greater impact. The Cabinet Secretary expressed her expectations for greater scrutiny and accountability of the funding and highlighted the ongoing evaluation of its implementation.",
        "The WISERD research findings indicate that students from different socio-economic backgrounds face varying levels of performance and resilience within the education system. The research, commissioned in November 2017, aims to examine whether current policies are effective in addressing these disparities. The report is expected to be published before the summer recess and will be made available to the public for review. The concerns raised by the research highlight the need to address the performance and resilience gaps among students from different socio-economic backgrounds. The research findings also suggest the importance of improving the support and resources available to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, particularly in relation to their education outcomes. The research further emphasizes the need for a collaborative approach involving education, social services, and health services to address the complex needs of looked-after children. The meeting also discussed the eligibility criteria for the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) and the need to adjust it to include students who have been adopted or looked after within a given period of time. The Cabinet Secretary expressed her intention to strike a balance between focus and flexibility in the allocation of PDG resources and stressed the need to strengthen monitoring arrangements to ensure effective support for looked-after children. The meeting also highlighted the importance of a broader approach to supporting vulnerable learners, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the need for improved teacher training and intervention strategies to address issues such as attachment disorder. Overall, the meeting emphasized the need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to improve the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system.",
        "The findings and concerns raised by WISERD research regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system were discussed in the meeting. The concerns raised included the performance and resilience of students in secondary schools, with a particular focus on the 50:50 chance of students from different socio-economic backgrounds attending a good or better secondary school. The concerns also extended to the fact that 10% of secondary schools were judged to be failing and 12% were under Estyn review. The meeting highlighted the need for a long-term solution to improve the quality of teaching and learning in secondary schools, as well as a short-term solution to address the immediate concerns. It was also noted that the performance and resilience of students in primary schools, special schools, and post-16 education sectors were generally positive, with improvements seen in pupil referral units and independent special schools. The meeting discussed the importance of early years education and the need to focus on the first few years of a child's education. The concerns raised by WISERD research were seen as important issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system."
