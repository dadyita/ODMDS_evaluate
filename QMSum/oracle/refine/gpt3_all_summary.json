        "During the meeting, the team discussed the evaluation criteria for the remote project. They considered factors such as ease of use, fashionability, physical feel, and technological innovation. The team members had different opinions on these criteria. The user interface team mentioned that they did not find the prototype easy to use and rated it a two on a seven-point scale. However, they liked the physical feel of the remote, particularly the curvature and the thumb-shaped buttons. The marketing team agreed with the user interface team's rating of two for ease of use and also mentioned that the remote felt good to hold. They were unsure about the technological innovation aspect since certain features were not reflected in the prototype. The industrial designer team believed that the remote's shape and integrated scroll-wheel or push-button added to its appeal, but they were unsure about its technological capabilities. Overall, the team felt that the project was beautiful and aligned with their initial discussions. They also expressed excitement about the potential success of the remote. Additionally, the team discussed the components and budget of the remote, deciding to use a lithium battery and potentially including two or three interfaces. When evaluating the entire production process, the team felt that they had some room for creativity but were initially restricted by the company's requirement to use a TV remote. They appreciated the opportunity to choose the direction of the project and felt satisfied with their level of control. The teamwork aspect was mostly positive, although there were some minor annoyances with the survey and digital pens. The team did not mention any new ideas that emerged during the process. However, they expressed their belief that the remote would be successful due to its cool design and desired technological features. They also discussed their preferences for fashionable and hip technology rather than purely functional ones. Some team members expressed their dislike for Apple products due to their association with low-tech and cheap designs. Finally, the team acknowledged that the costs of the project were within budget and planned to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary before celebrating with a big party."

        "During the meeting, there was a discussion about the back-end and storing data. The professor mentioned that there might be a need for more disk space as the nightly backups were starting to take too long. One suggestion was to buy a high-density tape drive and back up the data onto non-backed-up disks. Another option was to use CD-ROM or DVD for archiving, but it was mentioned that these media can degrade over time. The idea of putting the data on tape and then archiving it on CD-ROM was also discussed. It was suggested that a separate file server could be used for data that is rarely accessed, while a fast new file server could be used for heavily accessed data. The issue of consent and transcription for the SmartKom data was also mentioned. Overall, it was agreed that more disk space would be needed, and the professor suggested discussing the matter with Dave Johnson, who could provide more information and guidance on the best approach.",
