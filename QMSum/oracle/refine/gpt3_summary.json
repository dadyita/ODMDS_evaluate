They also discussed the challenges of implementing speech recognition and the advantages of using a low-cost circuit board.\n\nRegarding technical issues, the group discussed the possibility of using a stick or a round button for control, the use of LEDs for visual feedback, and the inclusion of a cradle for recharging the remote control. They also considered the advantages and disadvantages of implementing voice recognition and the potential impact on costs and battery life.\n\nOverall, the group had discussions about technical aspects such as energy sources and design elements like the method of control and visual feedback. They also touched on the project requirements and the potential challenges and benefits of implementing certain features.",
    "During the meeting, the team discussed the design of a new remote control for televisions. The user interface designer and industrial designer presented their ideas for the product's appearance and functionality. The user interface designer suggested implementing a scroll wheel, a cradle, and a remote call feature. The industrial designer proposed a design with a single-curved plastic body and rubber buttons. The team also discussed the potential issue of the scroll wheel being easily rotated if dropped. The industrial designer mentioned the possibility of making the remote control slightly lighter in the final design. \n\nThe marketing team expressed their satisfaction with the marketable features of the product, such as the remote call feature and the base station with a \"where's my remote\" button. They discussed the possibility of targeting a higher price range for a more exclusive market. The marketing team also mentioned the potential for adding a trigger button to the design, although they were unsure of its functionality. They emphasized the importance of making the product visually appealing and easy to use. \n\nThe project manager requested a detailed project plan from the industrial designer and marketing team, including the functional and technical design, team members involved, time frame, and budget. The project manager also emphasized the need for coordination between the industrial designer and user interface designer to ensure user acceptability. They stressed the importance of keeping the marketing team informed and involved in the design process. The project manager encouraged open communication and requested regular updates on progress.",
    "During the meeting, the decision was made to send another sample meeting to DARPA and to aim for a production mode by the July DARPA meeting. The discussion also revolved around the organization of meeting data and the transcription process. The paper discussed the amount of overlap in different corpora, such as Meeting Recorder meetings, Robustness meetings, Switchboard, and CallHome. It was found that the Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap, followed by Switchboard and CallHome, while the Robustness meetings had the least overlap. The paper also included statistics on the number of overlapped spurts and words in each corpus.",
    "During the meeting, the team discussed the evaluation criteria for the remote project. They considered factors such as ease of use, fashionability, physical feel, and technological innovation. The team members had different opinions on these criteria. The user interface team mentioned that they did not find the prototype easy to use and rated it a two on a seven-point scale. However, they liked the physical feel of the remote, particularly the curvature and the thumb-shaped buttons. The marketing team agreed with the user interface team's rating of two for ease of use and also mentioned that the remote felt good to hold. They were unsure about the technological innovation aspect since certain features were not reflected in the prototype. The industrial designer team believed that the remote's shape and integrated scroll-wheel or push-button added to its appeal, but they were unsure about its technological capabilities. Overall, the team felt that the project was beautiful and aligned with their initial discussions. They also expressed excitement about the potential success of the remote. Additionally, the team discussed the components and budget of the remote, deciding to use a lithium battery and potentially including two or three interfaces. When evaluating the entire production process, the team felt that they had some room for creativity but were initially restricted by the company's requirement to use a TV remote. They appreciated the opportunity to choose the direction of the project and felt satisfied with their level of control. The teamwork aspect was mostly positive, although there were some minor annoyances with the survey and digital pens. The team did not mention any new ideas that emerged during the process. However, they expressed their belief that the remote would be successful due to its cool design and desired technological features. They also discussed their preferences for fashionable and hip technology rather than purely functional ones. Some team members expressed their dislike for Apple products due to their association with low-tech and cheap designs. Finally, the team acknowledged that the costs of the project were within budget and planned to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary before celebrating with a big party.",
    "During the meeting, the professor discussed the need for more disk space for storing data. They mentioned that the nightly backups were taking too long and suggested options such as buying a high-density tape drive or using CD-ROM or DVD for archiving. It was noted that CD-ROM and DVD media can degrade over time. The idea of putting the data on tape and then archiving it on CD-ROM was also discussed. The professor suggested using a separate file server for rarely accessed data and a fast new file server for heavily accessed data. The issue of consent and transcription for the SmartKom data was also brought up. It was agreed that more disk space would be needed and the professor suggested consulting Dave Johnson for guidance on the best approach.",
    "During the meeting, Marketing and the Industrial Designer had disagreements regarding future product ideas. One of the disagreements was about the use of kinetic energy in the remote control. Marketing believed that it would be a good idea to incorporate kinetic energy, while the Industrial Designer was unsure about its feasibility and cost. Another disagreement was about making the product upgradable. Marketing suggested that the product should be designed in a way that allows for future upgrades, while the Industrial Designer was not convinced about the practicality and potential complications of implementing such a feature. These disagreements stemmed from differing perspectives and priorities between the two roles. Marketing was focused on marketability and innovation, while the Industrial Designer was more concerned with technical feasibility and production cost.",
