    "During the meeting, there was a discussion about the eligibility and targeting of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG). The money is being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, but it is important to ensure that individual interventions are only targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. Schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, as long as there is evidence that it has a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. \n\nThe meeting also addressed the issue of supporting more able and talented students. The Cabinet Secretary for Education emphasized that PDG should be used to support all eligible children, including those who are more able and talented. Examples were given of schools using PDG funding to provide experiences and opportunities to raise aspirations and drive potential for these students.\n\nThe effectiveness of the PDG in targeting and supporting eligible students was discussed. The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged that while the majority of schools are making appropriate decisions on how to use the funding, there is still room for improvement.

The guidance and awareness of how the PDG should be used are also being reviewed to ensure schools have a clear understanding of its purpose.\n\nThe issue of eligibility for free school meals as a measure for targeting students was also discussed. The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged that while it may not be absolutely focused, it is currently the best measure available. Efforts are being made to understand the impact of universal credit and explore other measures of identifying relative need in the future.\n\nThe meeting also addressed the issue of longer-term planning and flexibility in the allocation of the PDG. The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged the challenges of the current system, where eligibility is determined on an annual basis. Consideration is being given to providing longer-term projections to schools, but the need for flexibility in responding to changes in the number of eligible students was also highlighted.\n\nThe impact of the PDG on attendance and engagement with education was discussed. It was acknowledged that while improvements in attendance have been seen, there is still a gap between free-school-meal and non-free-school-meal pupils. Examples were given of schools using PDG funding to proactively address attendance issues, such as employing staff to work with families and implementing walking bus initiatives. Efforts are being made to further support this agenda and improve attendance for all students.\n\nThe meeting also addressed the issue of the attainment gap for free-school-meal pupils. It was acknowledged that while there has been progress in narrowing the gap over the years, there was a concern about the widening of the gap in 2017.
