    "The group discussed the possibility of using Tcl - TK for the transcribing of the data collection, as well as the use of Tcl-TK in the presentation, with the idea that it would be beneficial for the presentation. The group also discussed the need for a more efficient way of organizing the data, with a focus on the importance of having a simple and easy-to-understand format, and the need to have a simple way to organize the data. However, the group agreed that it was not necessary to use Tcl, as there was no need for it, as it was already in place. They also agreed that the team would need to be more efficient and efficient in their use of the program, as they would have to be able to analyze the data more efficiently. The team agreed that they would like to use a different type of speech synthesizer for the transcription of the speech, and they also agreed to incorporate a speech recognition system into the presentation to make it easier for people to understand what they were hearing. The Professor also suggested that the presentation should be presented in English, but the group disagreed with this idea, believing that using English would be a waste of time and not beneficial to the team. They decided to focus on translating the speech into English, as this would be easier for the audience to understand, and it would allow them to understand the context of the conversation.",
    "The group discussed the need for a user-friendly remote control that would be easy to use and easy to understand, with a simple design that could be easily understood by the user. The project manager suggested that the remote control should be simple, simple, and simple-looking, with buttons on the right side of the screen, and the user should be able to easily find the right button. The team also discussed the importance of having a simple and easy-to-use remote control, as it would be easier for the user to use than a complicated remote control with lots of buttons. The group agreed that it was important for the remote to be simple to use, and that it should not be too complicated, as there would be no need for complicated buttons. They also agreed that the user interface should be easily recognisable, and it should be easy for users to understand and understand what they're doing, as well as easy to remember. The user interface team agreed that there was no need to have a lot of buttons, as they would be easily accessible, but they did not want to overcomplicate the design of the remote by having too many buttons. However, they did agree that there should be a button on the left side, and they would like to include a button for the volume and a power button for power. The industrial designer proposed that the power button should be located at the top of the device, while the user would have to hold it for a few seconds to activate it, but the project manager disagreed, stating that it could be placed on the back of the user's hand. They agreed that this would be a good idea, as users would be more likely to use it if it were placed on their hands. The Industrial Designer suggested that a simple button would be the best way to control the remote, as the user could simply hold it with their hands and not have to lift it up to see what's on the screen. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer regarding the need to keep the design simple and simple, with the exception of the volume button, which would be placed in the center of the display.",
    "The Minister of Innovation, Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, and the Minister of Science, Science, and Economic Affairs Minister Jim Carr, Minister of Public Services and Procurement Ralph Goodale, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, David Lametti, have agreed to convene a meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic to discuss the impact of the pandemic on the Canadian economy and the government's actions during the special period. During the meeting, Mr. Ste-Marie raised concerns about the lack of support for the government during the period of uncertainty, as well as the need for further consultation with the provinces and territories. The Minister of Finance explained that the government was aware of the concerns raised by some members of the special committee, but they were confident that they would be able to address them in the coming weeks. He also expressed confidence in the ability of the government to address the issues raised by the committee, including the need to ensure the safety and security of Canadians and the importance of maintaining the integrity of the system.",
    "The industrial designer and industrial designer discussed the design of the remote control, with the industrial designer suggesting that the user interface should be simple and user-friendly, while the project manager suggested that it should be easy to use and easy to understand. The industrial designer also suggested that the design should be based on the shape of the animal, and that the remote should be able to be easily recognisable to the user. The project manager proposed that the product should have a simple design, with a simple look and feel, and a simple function, and it should not be too complicated, as it would be easy for the user to pick it up and use it. The user interface team agreed with this idea, and the team agreed that it was a good idea to have a user interface that could be easily understood by the user, as well as a simple and easy-to-use design that would make it easier for people to use. The team also agreed that they would like to incorporate the idea of a remote control into the product, as they believed that it would make the product more accessible to people of all ages and genders. The Industrial Designer proposed that it be a simple remote control that could easily be used by anyone, as long as it was not too complicated. The User Interface team agreed to design the remote with the idea that it could be used to control a variety of different types of devices, such as TVs, phones, and televisions, but they were unsure about how to incorporate it into a device that could also be used for other purposes.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of using the LDC to transcribe the transcriptions, with the goal of creating a corpus of data that could be used in the future. The team also discussed the importance of having a voice synthesizer, as it would be easier for the team to understand what was happening in the room, as well as the potential impact on the team's performance. The group discussed the need for a speech synthesizer that would be easy to understand, and the team agreed that the team would need to find a way to make it easier for them to understand it. They also discussed how they would like to be able to use the voice synthesizers for their research, as they were unable to find one that was easy to use due to the cost and complexity of the synthesizer. Additionally, the team discussed how to create a new method for transcribing the transcripts, as there was a lack of consensus on how to do it, and there were concerns about the quality of the audio, as the team had not been able to determine the exact location of the microphone, and it was unclear whether it was necessary to have a separate microphone for each person, or if they would have to use different microphones for different people.",
    "The team discussed the design of the remote control, with the user interface designer suggesting that it should be simple and simple, and the industrial designer suggesting the use of a single-curved case with buttons on the left and right sides, while the project manager suggested using a double curve for the buttons and a single curve on the right side. The industrial designer suggested that the buttons should be easy to find and easy to use, and suggested that they could be placed on the sides of the device to make it easier for users to find the buttons. The team also discussed the need for a unique design for the remote, with a simple design that would allow for a variety of shapes and sizes, as well as the possibility of incorporating a number of functions, such as the ability to change the volume, adjust the brightness, and adjust the battery. The project manager proposed that the remote should be able to be controlled by the user, and that it could be used to turn on and off by simply pressing a button on the screen. The user interface team proposed the idea of having a small button on each side of the display, and they also suggested that it would be possible to use the remote as a remote control to control the TV, as long as it wasn't too bulky. They also suggested the inclusion of a battery in the case, as it would reduce the cost of the product and reduce the amount of material needed for the battery, and it could also be used for other functions such as changing the volume or adjusting the battery size. The idea of using a kinetic battery to power the remote was also considered, but the team ultimately decided against it, as they believed that the battery would be too heavy and that the device would not be practical for everyday use. However, the team decided to incorporate a battery into the remote to increase the battery life, as there was a possibility of using the battery to charge the device in the future.",
    "Hefin david am: What are the challenges that you're seeing in the early implementation of the childcare offer? huw irranca-davies am: There are a lot of challenges that we're having to deal with, and we're trying to work through them, but I think it's important to understand them, and I think we're going to be able to address them in the future. Hefin David am: So, for example, there's the issue of the cost of childcare, which is something that we need to look at, and it's something we're working on, but we're also looking at how we can reduce the cost and the complexity of the system, and how it can be done in a way that is more cost-effective. hefin david AM: And what are some of the challenges you're dealing with, in terms of how to address the cost, and what are the issues that you need to be aware of, in order to make sure that it's not a problem for parents, and are they aware of what they need to do to ensure that their child receives the best possible care? Hefin david Am: Are you aware of any challenges that have arisen as a result of the pilot, and if there are any, what are they and what needs to be done to ensure a smooth rollout? Huw Irranca Davies am: Yes, we're aware of some challenges, but they're not insurmountable challenges, and they're being addressed through the pilot. We're working closely with the local authorities to understand what they're doing and how they're addressing them. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynvard, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer. Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020. We haven't got the exact number but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well because we also get people who will say to us, 'I don't want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look at my grandchildren because I look after them.', whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully.",
    "The Project Manager and the Industrial Designer discussed the idea of incorporating a voice recognition feature into the remote control, with the Project Manager stating that it was important for the remote to be able to recognize the user's voice, as it would be easier for them to understand what they were saying. The Project Manager emphasized the importance of having a simple design with a simple look and feel, while the User Interface team emphasized the need for a user-friendly design. The Industrial Designer emphasized that the remote should be easy to use and easy to understand, and the project manager emphasized that it should not be too complicated to use, as there was no need for complex buttons or buttons on the front of the remote. The project manager also mentioned that the product should be easily recognisable, and that the user interface team would have the ability to change the shape of the buttons to suit their personal preference. They also discussed the possibility of adding a speaker to the remote, but the industrial designer emphasized that they did not want to add too much complexity to the design, as they wanted to keep the design simple and simple. The industrial designer also emphasized that there would be no need to include any buttons, as the buttons would be easily accessible, and they would be easy for the user to find. The team also decided to incorporate a speaker into the design of the device, as well as incorporate a microphone for voice recognition, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice.",
    "Phd a: Well, I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed, but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker. And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth, or and even on prosody, which Don is gonna be working on soon, it adds this extra, you know, vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar. postdoc g: I had thought under my topic that I would mention the, four items that I I, put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting, which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans. So the room, it's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room and how it how the recordings are done, and that kind of thing. phd c: And so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there's there \u2019s speech in addition to to the thing we we did now which is just, speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file..",
    "The project manager explained that the team would need to come up with a marketing plan for the project, which would be based on the project manager's idea of making the remote control look like a coffee cup. The project manager also suggested that the marketing team would be responsible for creating the marketing plan, while the industrial designer would be in charge of the design. The team also discussed the need for a marketing strategy for the product, as well as how to market the product to the market. The marketing team proposed that the product should be simple to use and easy to use, and the team agreed that it was important to have a simple design that would appeal to a wide range of people. The industrial designer suggested that they would have to design the product in a way that would make it easy for people to use it, and that it should be easy to find and easy for the user to use. They also suggested the use of a drawing board for the design, as it would be easier for them to understand the concept of the product. However, the team was unable to come to an agreement on the budget, as the budget was too high, and they were unable to agree on the amount of time needed to complete the project. The group agreed that the project should be completed by the end of the year, and it was decided that the budget would be split between the marketing and the industrial design teams, with the marketing group focusing on the marketing, while industrial designer focusing on design and industrial designer on the industrial side. The Industrial Designer proposed the idea of using the design as a marketing tool, with a focus on making the product attractive and appealing to the consumer. The Project Manager agreed to this idea, but the Industrial Designer raised concerns about the cost of the project due to the lack of a budget, and suggested using the drawing board as a way to reduce costs.",
    "The Industrial Designer and the Project Manager discussed various options for the design of the remote, with the Industrial Designer suggesting the idea of using a plastic case and a rubber case, while the User Interface team suggested using a variety of different materials for the buttons, including a soft material, a rubber material, and a special material for the remote control. The Project Manager also suggested that the user interface team design the remote with a unique look and feel, as it would be easier for the user to use than a regular remote. The Industrial Designer also suggested incorporating a voice recognition feature on the back of the device, which would allow users to use their voice to activate the remote and control the TV, and the project manager agreed to this idea. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a back-up battery into the remote as a backup battery, which could be used to charge the device in case of an emergency. The project manager also mentioned that the remote would be able to power on and off with the help of a remote control button, and that it would have the ability to be programmed with the user's voice. The industrial designer also suggested the use of a back up battery to power the device if necessary, and suggested that it could be placed on the side of the TV to protect the battery from damage. The team also considered incorporating a speaker, but ultimately decided to go with a single-curved case for the speaker, as they felt that it was more aesthetically pleasing and less expensive than having two buttons on the front of the case.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating the remote control into the curriculum, with Kirsty Williams suggesting that it could be used as a stand-alone remote control, as it would be easier for children to access information on the internet. Kirsty williams am: The team also discussed the feasibility of incorporating it into the existing remote control system, and they agreed that it would not be too difficult to incorporate it into a new remote control. They also agreed that the cost of the remote should not exceed \u00a35,000, and that it should be priced at no more than \u00a31,000. The team decided that it was not necessary to include a remote control in the new curriculum, as there was no need for a separate remote control for the classroom, and it would only be used for remote control-related tasks.",
    "The group discussed the importance of having a diverse range of materials, with the WJEC suggesting that the best way to achieve this would be to have a range of different materials, ranging from simple and easy-to-use materials to more complex ones. The group also discussed the need for a more complex material, with Mike Ebbsworth stating that it would be important to include a variety of materials in the curriculum, with a focus on topics such as mathematics, English, Welsh, and Welsh-language content. They also considered the possibility of using different materials for different subjects, such as physics, mathematics, and physics, as well as different materials that could be used for Welsh and English-related subjects. They discussed the potential for different materials to be used in the future, with one suggestion being the use of spongy material, which is a material that is more flexible and adapts to the needs of different subjects. The team also suggested the introduction of a new material for Welsh-medium subjects, which would be based on the same material as the English-language material, but with the addition of a spongier material.",

The Industrial Designer emphasized the importance of a user-friendly remote control, and suggested that it should be easy to use and easy to understand. The Project Manager emphasized the need for a simple design, with a simple look and feel, as well as a simple price point. The User Interface team proposed the idea of a single-function remote control that could be used in different scenarios, such as in a dark room or in a darkened room. The industrial designer proposed that the user should be able to use the remote to turn on the TV, while the project manager suggested that users should have the ability to control the remote with their hands. The project manager agreed, but the Industrial Designer raised concerns about the cost of the product due to the high cost of materials and the lack of ergonomics. The user interface team agreed that the price should be reasonable, with the industrial designer suggesting a price point of twenty-five Euros, which would be lower than the current price of fifty Euros. They also proposed a price range of forty Euros for the product, which was agreed upon by the Industrial Design team. The team agreed to make the product more affordable than the price of the current remote control and decided to price the product at fifty Euros, as they believed that the consumer would be willing to pay more money for a remote control with a smaller price tag. Marketing emphasized the necessity of a unique design for the remote, as it was difficult to find a remote with a small price tag in the market.",
    "Hefin david am: So, what are the challenges that you're facing in the early years? julie morgan am: Well, there are a lot of challenges that we have to deal with, and one of them is that there's a lack of funding for early years, and we need to find a way to make sure that there are enough resources available to meet the needs of the children, so that they have the best possible start in life, and that's why we're investing in early years. Hefin David am: I think it's important to remember that we're talking about a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the Early Years, and they're continually developing, so it's not just about one programme, it's about the whole system, and it's a combination of different programmes. So, we're trying to find the best way to integrate them all together, and I think that's going to be a challenge, but we're going to do our best to do it. sian gwenllian am: And if you're willing to go that far, then I'm sure you'll be able to explain how it works, because it's something that we've been working on for a long time, and there's no doubt about the importance of it.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of using a low-pass filter to reduce the amount of noise in the system, with the idea of using the PDA mike to filter out the noise, but the professor suggested using a high - pass filter instead, as it would be more cost-effective and less expensive. However, the professor raised concerns about the cost of the filter due to the cost associated with it, as well as the fact that it would require a lot of energy to produce it. The professor suggested that the filter should be based on the frequency of the sound, as opposed to the low pass filter, which would be cheaper and more efficient. He also suggested that it be possible to use a low -pass filter instead of the LDA filter, as there is no need to waste energy on a filter that is too expensive. The team agreed that this was a good idea, and the professor agreed that it could be done, as long as it was done in a way that would be cost-efficient. The group decided to use the PDP as the filter, but they were not sure if they would be able to use it in the future, as they did not want to spend money on a new filter. They also wanted to make sure that it was not too expensive, as the cost would be prohibitive, and they were confident that they would not have to pay for it.",
    "The Prime Minister emphasized that the government has strong measures in place to prevent fraud, including a $1,000 no-penalty policy, and the creation of a national care guarantee, which would ensure that people would not lose their benefits if they were to lose their jobs due to fraud. The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of all Canadians, including those who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, as well as those who are living with disabilities. He also emphasized that there was a need for the government to work closely with the provinces and territories to ensure the safety and security of the population, and that the Prime Minister was committed to ensuring that all Canadians would be able to receive the necessary support. The government is committed to meeting the needs of those affected by COVID-19, and we will continue to work with the government and the provinces to ensure that everyone gets the support they need. However, the government is also committed to working closely with all stakeholders, including the provinces, to address the challenges faced by the families of those who lost their loved ones due to COVID. We are committed to supporting the families affected by this pandemic and ensuring that they have access to the services they need, while also ensuring that those who need help will receive it.

    "The WJEC does provide what's required in a regulatory sense, and there are two things there\u2014the specification, which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching, and also exemplar assessments, which include marking, and those go to the regulator before they are published. The Welsh Government does provide funding to the Welsh Government to support the process of providing Welsh-language versions for those textbooks. So, we use that funding to provide editorial support to the process and also to pay for translation costs, and we have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the Welsh government, as well as working closely with external translators, who have a wide range of experience in the field. Our other primary role is in maintaining standards. We have a Language Services team, including an excellent team of translators and editors, who provide excellent guidance to the curriculum team, and they have extensive experience in teaching in both English and Welsh. We've made a lot of use recently of speaking with teachers and the consortia, and ensuring then that we are focusing on those things that need that attention. llyr gruffydd am: But would you\u2014? The question I'm asking is: would you still see that as a core part of your work, although it's not necessarily essential in terms to the provision that you're required to provide? gareth pierce: Yes, we invest substantially from the W JEC budget into digital resources, so, through the types of conversations that Mike mentioned, in addition to identifying needs, deciding on priorities with teachers in individual subject areas, that can provide very useful information for us. Therefore, I think another interesting question is: can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating? And, certainly, it would be very unfortunate if there were a dozen Welsh-medium schools, for example, translating material from the same website independently of each other. If there are a few websites, or a few case studies, in this big external digital world, that were worth translating, shouldn't we able to source those early? Because I don't think it's a good use of teachers' time. Because we are not talking about examination boards competing with each other in Wales for GCSE and A-levels, in passing, that is something that I would want to suggest may deserve review. At the moment, these tend to be England-based\u2014Hodder Education and Illuminate Education, for example\u2014and then the Welsh Minister for Education, Mike Ebbsworth, assistant director educational support, has funded the process to provide the Welsh language versions of these textbooks.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the design of the remote control, with the project manager stating that the idea was to create a device with a unique look and feel, and the industrial designer stating that it was important to incorporate the brand into the design. The project manager also mentioned the need for a unique shape for the remote, with a different shape and a different color, as well as a different material for the buttons. The industrial designer also mentioned that the remote would have to be able to charge in the dark, as it would be difficult to charge it in daylight, and that it would need to be powered by solar power. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a remote control with a push button, but the team decided against it due to the cost of the battery, as they believed that the cost would be too high. They also decided to focus on the idea of a battery that could be placed on the side of the device instead of on the top of the screen, and they decided to go with a simple and simple design that would be easy to find and easy to use. The idea was also pitched to the team that it could be used to charge the remote by simply placing it on the table, but they were unable to agree on the size of the buttons, as there were too many of them to fit onto the table. They decided on a simple design with a small number of buttons on the front and a large number on the back, and it was decided that the design would be based on the shape of the body of the product, as opposed to the size and shape of a traditional remote control.",

    "The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HFCW) is concerned about the impact of Brexit on the Welsh higher education sector, with Dr. David Blaney, chief executive of the HFCW, saying that it is difficult to predict the impact on the sector, but he believes that it will be positive for Welsh universities. He also believes that there will be a significant increase in the number of EU students applying to Wales in the coming years. However, he warns that there is a risk that there could be a drop-off in applications from European Union students due to the uncertainty around the future relationship between the UK and the EU, and the lack of certainty about the future of the UK's relationship with the EU. Dr. Blaney also highlighted the need for universities to work closely with the European Union to ensure a smooth transition to a post-Brexit future, with the aim of ensuring that students from the EU are able to continue their education in Wales. He believes that the government should focus on supporting students in Wales, as well as ensuring that Welsh universities have the support they need to continue to attract students from across the world. He added that there was a need to ensure that universities had the resources they needed to meet the needs of their students, and that they were prepared to invest in research and innovation. He highlighted the importance of having a well-resourced and well-equipped university system, with a focus on the quality of facilities and infrastructure.",

They also agreed that it was important to have two types, one for the semantic and the other for the syntactic, and that the latter would be more useful for syntactic purposes. They agreed that there was no need for the former, but the latter could be used in situations where there was a need for it, such as in the case of a speech bubble, where the speech bubble would need to have a name and a number, and the number would have to be either a number or a number.",

    "The Minister of Veterans Affairs and Veterans Affairs expressed concerns about the lack of support for veterans affected by the pandemic, and the Minister of Seniors emphasized the importance of providing support for those who have lost their loved ones due to illness. The Minister emphasized the need for the government to address the issue of long-term care for veterans and their families, as well as the need to ensure that they have access to the necessary support. He also emphasized that the government is committed to ensuring that all Canadians have the support they need to survive and thrive in the face of this pandemic. However, the Minister emphasized that there is a need for more support for seniors, as they are at risk of losing their homes due to lack of access to health care and lack of financial support. The government is working to address this issue, and it is important for the Minister to address concerns raised by the petitioners. The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support the government's efforts to address these issues and to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians. They are calling for the Prime Minister to prioritize the safety of Canadians, and they are asking for a review of the government\u2019s policies and programs to ensure they are in line with international standards. They also call for a public debate on how to deal with the challenges faced by the government, and for the Government to take appropriate action to address them. The Prime Minister's Office should prioritize the needs of Canadians in the wake of this crisis and ensure that their needs are being met. The Ministry of Veterans' Affairs and Emergency Preparedness is working closely with the Department of Veteran Affairs to ensure their safety and support for families affected by this crisis. The Government is working with the Veterans' Association of Canada and the Canadian Red Cross to address issues related to the crisis, including support for the families of those who lost loved ones. The Department is also working with organizations like the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, the Canadian Mental Health Association, and other organizations in the region to address challenges related to mental health and mental well-being.",
    "The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be simple, simple, and easy to use, and the Project Manager agreed, but the Industrial Designer disagreed with this idea, stating that it would take too much time to learn how to use the remote, and that the design should be based on the user's preferences. The Industrial Designer also suggested that it should be easy to change the color, shape, and size of the remote controls, as well as the shape of the buttons, as it would be easier for the user to find the right buttons. The Project Manager also suggested the addition of a remote control button on the right side of the device, which was met with skepticism by the User Interface Designer, who believed that it was unnecessary and unnecessary, and suggested that a simple button would suffice. However, the Industrial Design team disagreed with the idea, believing that the user should be able to control the remote with just one button, while the Marketing team believed that a button should be placed on the left-hand side, as this would make it easier to use. The User Interface team agreed with the Marketing Team regarding the need for a simple remote control with a simple design, as they believed that the cost of the product should not be too high and that it could be easily understood by the user. They also agreed that the price should be reasonable, with a price point of less than five Euros per remote control and a price range of five Euros to ten Euros. The Marketing team also suggested a simple and easy-to-use remote control that could be controlled by a single button, but they were unable to agree on the price, as there were too many buttons to fit in a single remote control, and it was difficult to find a price that was affordable.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer came up with the idea of making the remote control with a spongy texture, which would make it easier to use, and the idea was to incorporate the fruit and vegetable colours into the design, as well as the ability to change the shape of the remote to fit in different shapes and sizes. The project manager also suggested that the remote should be able to adapt to different sizes and shapes depending on the needs of the user, and that it should be easy to use and easy to maintain. Industrial designer: So we're going to have to decide whether or not we want to use the same material for all of the buttons, or if we want something that's a little bit different, like a different material or a different shape, or something that can be used in different sizes. industrial designer: Yeah, I think it would be a good idea to go with a variety of colors, but we could also go for a lot of different shapes, and we would like to incorporate a lot more variety in terms of the shape and feel of the design. marketing: It would be interesting to see if we could find a way to make it look like a fruit or a vegetable, or whether we could incorporate fruit and vegetables into it, and whether it would make sense to use different colours for different shapes. Industrial Designer: I think we'll go for the fruit or vegetables, and I think that it's going to be fun to have fruit and veggies on the front and back of the device, and it'll be fun for people to see what they're wearing and what they want to do with it. marketing: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy-to- locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, though that did seem to be the favoured strategy, but there was also, on the sideline, the though of maybe having a beeper function. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device? industrial designer and project manager: Well, we're gonna have to make sure that it doesn't interfere with the whole look of the product, so we'll have to be careful not to interfere with it, but if it does, we'll definitely have to change it.",
    "grad c: and so we had a meeting on Friday talking about how to avoid that, and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject m to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those, and there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it it's getting more complicated. grad c: Yeah a and the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names and maybe some ma ma major streets and their calls. grad g: and we want to maybe ask them, if you have get it sort of isolated street the the, whatever, \" River Street \", and they know that they have decided that, yes, that's where they want to do this kind of action, they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it ''s too hard to memorize all these st strange German names. grad e: So you ''re just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever? grad c:' Yeah a,' and the Map is more of a way for the subject to know where to go and what to do.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, addressed the concerns raised by the Deputy Minister regarding the need for a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the change in the law, stating that it was important for the public to be aware of the implications of the law change. She also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public understands the impact of the Bill and the need to promote public awareness. The Deputy Minister emphasized that the Bill was not intended to create a new criminal offence, but rather to change the existing law, and that it should not be seen as a new offence. However, it is important to note that it is not a criminal offence for a child to be physically punished, as it is a criminal offense for a parent to physically punish their child, and there is a duty to educate the public about the change to the law. Additionally, it was emphasised that the law should be amended to ensure that children are not subjected to physical punishment if they have been physically punished in the past, as this could lead to a negative impact on their education and employment opportunities. I believe that this is the only way to achieve the objectives of this Bill, and I am confident that it will have a positive impact on the lives of children and their families. I also believe that the introduction of the new law will not result in a significant increase in the number of children being sent to carers, as there is no evidence to suggest that this will lead to an increase in child abuse. I think it's important to focus on the positive impact of this law on children and families, and it is essential for the Welsh Government to address the concerns of parents and ensure that they are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, as these amendments are necessary to ensure the success of the awareness campaign, as well as ensuring that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect children from harm in the future.",
    "The WJEC does provide what's required in a regulatory sense, and there are two things there\u2014the specification, which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching, and also exemplar assessments, which include marking, and those go to the regulator before they are published. The Welsh Government does invest a great deal in resources that we produce digitally in both languages simultaneously. Each new course has substantial teaching guidance, which includes a lot of useful information for teachers and pupils. And we run a professional development programme for teachers that is free of charge when courses are new, and then annually there is some charge for those events. And, in addition, I'm a governor of one of the schools that features in the video. So, item 2, then, today is our first session on the provision of textbooks and learning resources for pupils, which is a video of interviews with young people and teachers. The committee team has been out to take video evidence around Wales, and we're now going to watch the results of that on the screen. We'll move on now then to our evidence session, and I'm very pleased to welcome Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the Welsh Education Commission (WJEC), Mike Ebbsworth, assistant director educational support, Welsh Government, and Philip Blaker, Chief Executive of Qualifications Wales, to the stage. gareth pierce: I think the question of translation is an interesting one. I think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that, largely because comparable outcomes are designed for circumstances like this, where there's a change in a specification particularly, because there are any number of reasons, including resources, why performance may be different from one year to the next, but comparable outcomes is there to ensure that, all things being equal, if the cohorts have the same ability, the same grade should be awarded. Therefore, I think another interesting question is: can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating? And, certainly, it would be very unfortunate if there were a dozen Welsh-medium schools, for example, translating material from the same website independently of each other. If there are a few websites, or a few case studies, in this big external digital world, shouldn't we able to source those early? Because I don't think it's a good use of teachers' time. philip blaker: Yes, we invest substantially from the Welsh Government budget into digital resources, so, through the types of conversations that Mike mentioned, we develop approval criteria and we ask Welsh Government to submit their specifications against those approval criteria. We have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the Welsh-language team and we work closely with external translators too, which facilitates a great many things. We've made a lot more use recently of speaking with teachers and the consortia, and ensuring then that we are focusing on those things that need that attention. llyr gruffydd am: But would you\u2014? The question I'm asking is: would you still see that as a core part of your work, although it's not necessarily essential in regard to the provision that you're required to provide?",

    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the design of the remote control, with the project manager stating that the idea was to create a device with a unique look and feel, and the industrial designer stating that it was important to have a design that was unique to the brand. The project manager also mentioned the need for a different material for the case, as it was difficult to find a material that would fit in the budget budget. The industrial designer also mentioned that they would need to design a new case for the remote, as the previous one was too expensive, and they would have to change the shape of the case to fit in a different shape. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a battery, as they were concerned about the cost of the device, as well as the need to be able to charge the device in the dark. The team discussed the idea of a remote control that could be used to charge other devices, such as televisions and computers, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the size of the battery. They decided to go with a smaller size, as there was no need for it to be too bulky, and it would be easier for people to hold it in their hands. The idea of using a battery was also discussed, but the team ultimately decided to focus on a simple design that would be easy to use and easy to replace. They discussed the feasibility of using the same material as the existing remote control and decided to use a plastic case instead of a plastic one, as this would be more durable and less expensive.",
    "Phd f: We have a lot of work to do in terms of making sure that we have a good understanding of what's going on with the data, and we have to figure out how to make sure that it doesn't get lost in translation. We also have to decide whether or not we want to use a different type of data, or if we'd like to keep it in the same format, or whether we want it to have a different look and feel to it. We'll see if we can get it to work in a different format or if it would be better to have it in a new format.. grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and different compiler work - arounds and so on. So the fact that it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get IT to work under Windows.. So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it, do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting, phd F: What what kind of what does that look like? The string that you type in. professor b: And then does it play something back or that's something you ''re having to program? graduate h: It would be nice to be able to play the audio, but I don't know if it's possible to do that because it would require a lot more effort, and I think it would take too much time to do it, so I'm not sure if I should do it or not, but it might be a good idea to just do it and see if it works.",
    "The group discussed the introduction of the new remote control project, including the concept decisions, the universal remote, parental control, games, and voice recognition. Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to note that the concept of universal remote control has been around for a long time, and it's a concept that has been used in a number of countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United States. However, it's not a universal concept, and we have to be mindful of the fact that it may not be universally accepted by all schools. We need to make sure that we have a good understanding of how it works, and that we are using it in a way that meets the needs of the children. We have to ensure that it is effective and that it's effective for all children, but we need to be careful not to lose sight of the need for the children who are eligible for free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free school-meal counterparts. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concepts of growth mindset in school, so, they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who have to pay for school meals, and they have to demonstrate that they have a positive impact on the free school meal programme. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning difficult for a lot of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional \u00a340 million to introduce an Ever 6. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years. darren millar am: It's just a very brief point in response to the $40 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG, yes? Kirsty, do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to ensure it is being used properly?",

    "Sharon davies: I can only speak for Torfaen\u2014we've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system, and we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding\u2014they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they've have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools, and sometimes they've had to look to other areas of the school to meet the needs of the learner. But there's a little bit of lag, trying to bring everybody up to the same, consistent level. But I think work is afoot in nearly all local authorities, as far as I'm aware. In terms of school accountability measures, do you think that they have had an impact on the rise in exclusions? sharon d Davies: When we're looking at the accountabilities, there\u2019s a huge amount of pressures on schools to perform, and I think the whole culture that the schools are within does play an element of it to some\u2014. We are seeing a change with the interim measures coming on board, but I think there's going to be a lag in the system before we see that having a knock-on effect on our learners, because, undoubtedly, there are pressures on school. lynne neagle am: So, you\u2019ve seen an improvement since the capped 9 has been brought in? sh Sharon Davies: I think it's early to say, but certainly we're working towards that improvement. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister has currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding has become increasingly under pressure\u2014there have been big issues around Tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals because they were losing them time and time again. Anybody got anything to add to that, or\u2014? nick williams: May I answer this in Welsh? Sharon, we have a team-around-the-family approach. So, as you say, it's more complicated than just the child behaving in a certain way, or being school-anxious, whatever the issue is, so it's sort of bringing all of the agencies together to try and look at how we can proactively solve problems and support the families. Because nearly always, the behaviours that are demonstrated, or come out in schools, or whatever provision, is obviously probably greater in the home environment, so there is a whole\u2014. sharon Davies: We've just developed a behaviour and well-being strategy, which, with schools, I know across Wales we've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice, so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through, whereas in the past\u2014I'm thinking myself, now, as a teacher\u2014they were just difficult behaviours.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the need for a new remote control that would be more user-friendly, with the user interface stating that they would like to be able to control the remote with the touch of a button, while the industrial designer emphasized the importance of having a simple design with a simple look and feel. The industrial designer suggested that the remote control should be simple, simple, and simple, with a few buttons on the left and right sides, and the project manager agreed with this idea, stating that it would be easier for the user to use the remote than a traditional remote control.

However, we do recognise the importance of the PDG, and it is important for us to make sure that it is implemented in a way that maximises the impact of the grant, and that we have the support and support that is needed to achieve that. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there's some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. I just want to know if there is any evidence to suggest that schools are using PDG effectively, and if they are using it effectively. meilyr Rowlands: Yes, we've done that. claire morgan: Throughout our inspections, we are looking for best practice, because part of our strategy is always to identify where there are weaknesses, but actually to point schools in the direction of where they can find a solution. It was being spent on children who were underachievement, and one of the things we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was spent on boys than girls. I think, ultimately, all of these sorts of initiatives come down to strong leadership and effective leadership\u2014that they know how to organise and use those grants effectively.

    "The team discussed the possibility of using a push-buttons for the remote control, with the user interface designer suggesting the idea of using rubber for the buttons, while the project manager suggested using a double-curved case for the push buttons, and the industrial designer suggested using rubber as the material for the case, as it would be cheaper and easier to handle. The team also discussed the feasibility of incorporating a speaker into the remote, with industrial designer stating that it could be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from simple to more advanced. The industrial designer also suggested the use of a rubber case, which would be more cost-effective, as they would be able to use it for a wide range of functions, such as turning on and off, as well as controlling the volume and volume of the TV. The project manager also mentioned the possibility to use a push button for the volume, but the team ultimately decided to go with a simple push-button for the button, as this would be easier for the user to reach and easier for them to reach. They also decided to use rubber as a material, as there was no need to worry about the cost of the case material, and they could easily adjust the size of the buttons to suit the user's hand size and shape of the remote. The user interface team also considered using a rubber-based case, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost and complexity of the product. They decided to focus on a simple design that would be easy to use and easy to maintain, with a small amount of effort, and would be easily replaceable in the future. However, the team realized that they would need to incorporate a speaker in the remote to communicate with the TV, but they were not sure if they could find a way to incorporate it in a remote control that would fit comfortably into a smaller package. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to have a speaker, but I don't know if it's going to work or not. user interface: 'cause The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where, basically, you can program a sample wi That when you say something it will give a response, and you program the response as well. industrial designer: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether we want to go for a double or a single curved case, or if we want it to be a double curved case or not, but we have to make sure that it's not too heavy or too light, and that it doesn't get in the way of other people's work.",

The industrial designer proposed that the design of the case should be based on the user's preference, and that it should be made of plastic or plastic plastic, with a plastic color and a plastic body. The user interface suggested that a plastic case be added to the cover, which would allow for the user to easily change the color, as well as the shape and size of the buttons. The project manager agreed to this idea, as long as it was not too expensive, as he believed that the price of the product would be less than fifteen Euros. However, the project manager expressed concerns about the cost of manufacturing the product, as there was a lack of information about the price, and it was difficult to estimate how much it would cost to produce the product. The team decided to go with a budget of fifteen Euros for the model, which was decided upon by the team due to the fact that it was cheaper than the average person's budget, and they were confident that they would be able to sell the product for less money than they would have to spend on the average consumer. They also discussed the need for a user-friendly design, as they were concerned about the lack of buttons on the remote control and the need to have a simple design that was easy to use and easy to understand. They decided to focus on a simple look and feel, with an easy-to-understand design and a simple color scheme. The design team also decided to use a plastic cover for the device, which they felt would make it easy for users to easily adjust the color of the display, as the case material was plastic and the shape was similar to that of a normal case.",
    "Meilyr rowlands: I think it's important to recognise that there's a difference between a primary school and a secondary school, and we need to make sure that we have a good balance between the two. We need to ensure that secondary schools have the resources they need to meet the needs of their pupils, and that they have the support and support they need. I think there are a lot of challenges for secondary schools, but I think they're doing a good job, and I think that they're going to be able to meet their needs. suzy davies am: Can I just ask: is that based on your evidence around primary schools, where the sort of ethos that we've seen in the curriculum has been already articulated through the foundation phase? meilyr Rowlands: The track record I'm talking about is across the board, so it's very difficult to think of anything that's actually got worse over the last three or four years, but it's difficult to say that standards of provision is slipping. It might not be improving as quickly as we would like, but the purpose of major curriculum and, more generally, educational reform is to make everyone take that seriously, and there's work going on regarding the workload issue. A large number of schools and teachers and leaders have been part of preparing the new curriculum and all the associated work, as well as doing the day job. But also the time it takes for the headteacher and the senior staff to make those decisions can take their eye off the educational ball because they're looking at these financial and staffing issues. I hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in Wales, because there is a number of good things we can report also. The primary sector, the special sector, post-16\u2014there are many sectors that are doing robust research into the subject matter. So, there are lots of ways\u2014we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary, particularly in Welsh-medium, where there's currently a shortage. Just before going on to that, just to pick up on that last point that you made about the shortage of teachers and losing teachers during the first year of their training. Has Estyn done any themed work on that particular issue, or do you intend to do anything on that? Also, looking at the financial incentives and how they compare with the situation in England, for example; do we need, perhaps, to think about financial incentives, not just for specific subjects, but for going to schools where there are particular issues, perhaps? Meilyr Rowelands: Yes. I know that Professor Mick Waters is looking at this currently and we've had the discussion with him. Now, we are looking at initial teacher training, but we haven't looked at the first couple of years for many a year. And, for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on this particular issue and that work will be published in due course.",

Right hon. Chair, it is important to note that there is no evidence of any fraud in this case, but there are concerns that there may have been some fraud in the past, and there is a need for a review of the program to determine whether there was any potential for fraud. The government is aware of these concerns, and they are working to address them. We are working hard to address the issue of fraud, and we will ensure that there are safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the programs and ensure that anyone who received money fraudulently will have to pay back the money. We will also ensure that people who have been affected by COVID-19 will not be able to access the benefits, as they will be required to repay the money to the government if they are found to have committed fraud. In order to address this issue, the government has set up a special committee to review the program, which will be chaired by the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, Innovation, and Economic Affairs. The committee will meet again on Friday, May 24, to discuss the implementation of the Canada emergency student benefit and the creation of a national care guarantee program. The Minister of Finance will present a report on the program in the coming weeks, and it will be presented to Parliament.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition system into the remote control, with the idea of using voice recognition to activate the remote, but they were unable to come up with a solution that would be cost-effective, as it would require a lot of time and money. The team decided to focus on a single-curved design, with a spongy texture and a unique shape, as well as incorporating a number of different colours and patterns into the design, including fruit and vegetable colours and a variety of shapes and sizes. Industrial designer: We're going to start with the fruit-and-vegetable colours, as they're the most popular colors right now, and we want to incorporate them into the overall design of the remote. industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to have a fruit- and vegetable-inspired design, and I think we could easily incorporate the fruit and vegetables into the shape of the shape, and then we could use it as a base for the other colours. We could also incorporate the ability to change the shape and size of the buttons on the remote depending on the needs of the user. We also discussed the feasibility of adding a remote control to the device, and the team agreed that it would take some time to design and manufacture, but ultimately decided to go for a simple design with a simple look and feel. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be shaped like a noodle, but the project manager disagreed, saying that it was too hard to make it look like a normal remote control. The project manager agreed with the industrial designer's assessment that the design should be simple, and suggested that it should be made of plastic, and that the buttons should be easy to find and easy to use. Industrial Designer: We could easily find the right shape, but we have to make sure that it's not too hard for the user to find it, because it's going to be hard for them to find the buttons. The idea was to have the buttons in different sizes, with different shapes and colors, and it was suggested that they could be placed in different positions depending on how they were positioned, but it was ultimately decided that they should be in the same place.",
    "The met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market, because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So we need to combine those ones industrial designer: user interface: and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. marketing: Y yeah yeah, we have to, because d you can see how people have related their clothes, shoes, and everything with fruits and vegetables, project manager: User Interface: marketing: because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic, becoming more and more organic, user Interface: Okay. industrial designer, User Interface, and Industrial Designer discussed the possibility of using different colors for the remote control, including lemon, lime, and yellow. The industrial designer suggested using a yellow color for the L_C_D, while the user interface suggested using yellow for the T_V, and the project manager agreed.",
    "User Interface: Okay, so we're going to start with the idea of making a remote control with a different look and feel, but we're not sure if we want to use the same shape as the current remote control or if we should change the shape of the remote control, or if it should have a different shape or something different, and we need to make sure that it's not too big or too small to fit into a purse or something like that. Industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to go with a flat design, but I don't know if it's practical to do that, but it would make it easier for people to hold it in their hand and not have to lift it off the table. user interface: I'm not sure about that, I think that it might not be practical, but if it is, it's okay because we can adjust the size of the buttons on the remote to suit different shapes and sizes. industrial designer: Yeah, we'll see if we can find a way to make it smaller and easier to hold, but the idea is to keep it small and easy to carry around so that it doesn't get in the way of other people's hands. marketing: Okay, so we'll have to think about that and see if there's any way to reduce the cost of the product, and then we'll decide whether or not it's worth investing more money to make the product more expensive, but as long as it's still affordable, we can afford it. Industrial Designer: We'll see what we can do, but there's no guarantee that we'll be able to achieve the cost savings because we have to pay for all of the components separately, so it's important for us to have a price point that's reasonable and affordable.",

Heaney highlighted the importance of ensuring that there are adequate resources in place to deal with the pandemic, and highlighted the need for more support for children and their families. He added that the government was working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that there were adequate resources to meet the needs of the children affected by the outbreak, as well as providing support for the wider community. The Minister for Education expressed concerns about the impact on children's mental health and their ability to access services, and the Minister for Children and Young People agreed that there was a need for further research into how to address the issue of mental health in the future.",
    "Phd f: I think it would be a good idea to have a bunch of people working on it because it's a lot easier for them to understand what they're doing and to be able to understand it more easily. grad h: Right, which So I've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the ThisL tools are there're two sets, there's a back - end and a front - end, so the front- end is the user interface and the back - End is the indexing tool and the querying tool.. So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for conveniently you can now do Information retrieval on it, do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting, Phd F: What what kind of what does that look like? The string that you type in.

    "User Interface: Okay, we have a lot of different types of remote controls in the market and we have to find a way to integrate them all into the same remote control, and we need to find the right one for each one, but we can't have too many buttons because it would be too difficult for people to understand them all, and it would make it difficult for them to understand what they're doing. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to incorporate speech recognition into the remote control as it will be easier for the user to understand it and it will make it easier to use it. User Interface: We have to make sure that it's not too complicated to use, but it's also important for the users to be comfortable with it. Industrial Designer: We need to make it easy to use and easy to understand, and I think we can do that by making it easy for the consumer to understand and understand what's going on. We also need to design the remote to be user-friendly, and the industrial designer believes that it is important to design it in a way that it can be easily accessible to the user. The industrial designer also believes that the user interface should be able to control the remote with their hands, and that it should be simple to use. The user interface designer also thinks that the remote should be ergonomic, as it should not be too bulky or too complicated, and they should be easy to hold and operate. The project manager agreed with User Interface on this point, and User Interface agreed with Industrial Designer on the importance of having a simple design and a simple look and feel. The Industrial Designer also agreed with the User Interface User Interface team on the need for a simple and simple design, as they felt that it was not necessary to have a complicated design, but they did not want it to be too complicated.",
    "Meilyr rowlands: I think it's important to recognise that there's a lot of work to be done, and we need to make sure that we have a system in place to ensure that people have the support they need to be able to do it. I think there are a number of things that we can do to support teachers, but we have to be careful not to lose sight of the fact that there is a need for co-construction, and I think that the focus needs to be on making sure that schools are prepared for the new curriculum, and that they have the right people in the right roles. We need to focus on ensuring that there are enough teachers in the system to meet the needs of the children, and it's also important for the education system as a whole to have a well-rounded and well-informed workforce. suzy davies am: Can I just ask you then about the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools, which I've just mentioned previously, and also what your views are on the impact of funding for schools on that as well? Because we're in a situation where a couple of primary schools have got surplus funds, sometimes that's because of end of year additional funds just being magicked up, but there's also a serious worry that so many secondary schools are in deficit. Is there a correlation between those two positions, that secondary schools may be less ready for this than primary schools, and is there a need to increase funding for secondary schools to get to grips with this, albeit that there'll be a phasing in? Meilyr Rowlands: Yes, there are currently discussions ongoing between us and the Government about working in those early years for teachers. I know that Professor Mick Waters is looking at this currently and we've had the discussion with him. Now, we are, of course, looking at initial teacher training but we haven't looked at the first couple of years for many a year. And for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on that particular issue and that work will be published in due course. sian gwenllian am: Okay, and on that point of scrutiny, will we be back in a scenario where we're being told, 'You can't compare one set of results against the previous year's results, because of the nature of the change? meilyr rowinglands: Bore da, bawb. I don't think you can make that straightforward correlation, but if you do look at surpluses and reserves, they have been more or less constant for primary schools over a long period of time, but they have declined for secondary school, so it's difficult to say that standards of provision is slipping. It might not be improving as quickly as we would like, but the purpose of major curriculum and, more generally, educational reform is to make certain that we do get a more substantial sort of improvement. A large number of schools and teachers and leaders have been part of preparing the New curriculum and all the associated work, as well as doing the day job, I think their commitment and their engagement with curriculum reform, and engagement with wider education reform, is to be congratulated. So, I hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the Education system in Wales, because there are plenty of good things we can report also. The primary sector, the special sector, post-16\u2014there are many per cent of sectors that are doing well, and there are others that are not doing well. I welcome some of the part-time Open University courses, for example, so there are lots of ways\u2014we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary, particularly in Welsh-medium.",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to\u2014in challenge advisers' discussions in schools\u2014we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meal. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wresford, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-, meal-eating counterparts. One of the things that they've used PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. kirsty Willams am: Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world, and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work, so, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6 concept, but as an 'Ever 2' concept.",
    "User Interface: Okay, so we're going to start with the basic design of the remote control, and then we'll talk about the functions of the buttons and how we can incorporate them into the design. Industrial designer: We need to make sure that the buttons are easy to find and easy to use, and we need to be able to change the color of the button to match the colors of the TV screen, so that it's easy to see what's on the screen. We also need to find a way to make it easier for the user to find the buttons, as well as make it easy for them to find them. Industrial Designer: I think it would be a good idea to have the buttons on the right side of the screen, as it's easier to reach and easier to see, and it would also be easier for people to understand what's going on. User Interface: Yeah, I agree with this idea, but I think that it might be a little confusing for people who are used to having a lot of buttons on their remote controls, and they might not know how to use it properly, so it might not be the best idea for them. industrial designer: I don't think it's a bad idea at all, it's just a matter of knowing what they need and what they want, and if they're willing to pay more money for it.. So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code, which is then communicated to the remote site, which h has an infrared receiver.. user interface: If you have questions project manager: If that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it was important to include video and D_V_D_, I could get back to them and see. industrial Designer: It would be nice to have a button on the left side, but it's not practical to have two buttons on one side, so I would like to have just one button on each side, and I'm not sure if there's enough room for two buttons, or if it's better to have one on either side, or whether it's necessary to have more than one button for different functions.",
    "dafydd evans: I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. At the moment it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it. kay martin: Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world, so, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. sian gwenllian am: So, do we get rid of it?

    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a touch screen into the remote control, with the idea of having a scroll wheel on the remote, but they decided against it, as it would be too expensive and difficult to produce. The team also discussed the feasibility of using an LCD screen, but ultimately decided against this option, as they felt that it was too expensive, and that it would not be practical. They also decided to focus on the design of the remote itself, considering the cost and complexity of the project manager's presentation, as well as the fact that the team was unable to find a way to incorporate it into the project due to budget constraints. However, the team decided to go with a rubber-based remote control as the most cost-effective option as it is more durable and less expensive than the LCD, and it is easier to maintain. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be shaped like a tomato, and the team agreed that the shape of the case should not be too different from that of a regular TV remote, as there is no need for a hard plastic casing. The project manager also suggested the use of rubber as a material for the case, but the industrial designer expressed concerns about the cost of using rubber for the casing and suggested using a plastic case for the buttons, as the rubber would be cheaper and more durable than the rubber. The idea of using a rubber case was also discussed, but it was ultimately decided that a rubber casing would be more cost-efficient and would be easier to produce than a plastic one.",

They also agreed that it was important for the remote to be aesthetically pleasing, and that it should be easy on the eye and easy for users to use. The team also agreed on the need to have a small and simple design, as they wanted to avoid having too many buttons on the remote, and they also wanted to minimize the size of the remote and make it easy to find. The project manager suggested that the user should be able to easily find the right button, and the user interface agreed to this idea, but the project manager expressed concern about the cost of the project due to the complexity of the task at hand. However, the industrial designer emphasized that the team would need to find a way to make the remote more user-friendly, as there was a lot of work to be done in terms of the design. The industrial designer proposed that the design should be based on the user's preferences, with a focus on simplicity, simplicity, and ease of use, and a simple look. The user interface suggested that there should be a small button on the right side of the screen, as the user could easily find it by looking at the screen and pressing it, and there should also be a button at the top for volume and a button in the middle for volume control.

The project manager suggested that the remote could be used to turn on the television, but the team was skeptical about the idea, as it would be difficult to find a place for the light, and it would require a lot of time and money to make it work properly. However, the project manager believed that the team could find a way to incorporate the light into the design of the device, and they were confident that they could achieve the desired result. The idea of using a light for the remote was also discussed, as the team believed that it would make the remote more user-friendly, but they were unsure about how to incorporate it into the product, as they were not sure if it was a good idea to include a light in the remote or not, or if it should be a light that was too bright or not bright enough to be seen by the user, or whether it was too dark to be easily seen by a human. They also discussed how to integrate the remote into the user's hands, with a focus on the user interface, and how to make the device more user friendly. The remote control was also designed to be easy to use, with buttons on the left and right sides, and a button on the right side for volume and volume control, while the left button was to be used for volume control and the right button for power and volume. The user interface team also suggested the addition of a button for the power button, which the team agreed to, but there were concerns about the cost, as there was a lack of information about how much money was being spent on the project and the amount of time it would take to produce the product.",

The industrial designer emphasized the need to be simple in terms of design, as it would make the user's life easier and more comfortable, and it would allow them to easily find the right button for the task at hand. The user interface emphasized that they would like to keep the design simple, but the team agreed that the design should not be too complicated, as there was no need to include too many buttons, and they wanted to keep it simple. The Industrial Designer emphasized that there should be a simple look and feel to the remote, and that it should be easily recognisable to the user and not too complicated. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer's assessment that there was a lack of clarity in the design of the remote controls, but they were confident that the team could come up with a design that was simple, simple, and simple enough to be used by the average user.",

The user interface suggested that there should be two buttons on the right side, one for each channel, and one for the volume and the other for the power button. They also proposed that the button should be placed on the left side of the screen, as this would make it easier for users to see what's happening on the screen and would allow them to switch to the next channel without having to look at the screen. The group also agreed to include the ability to change the channel by pressing the button, which would allow users to switch between different channels, as well as the ability for the remote to be used in different scenarios, such as when the TV is turned on and off, or when the television is turned off and on again.",
    "The WJEC does provide what's required in a regulatory sense, and there are two things there\u2014the specification, which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching, and also exemplar assessments, which include marking, and those go to the regulator before they are published. The Welsh government does invest a great deal in resources that we produce digitally in both languages simultaneously. Each new course has substantial teaching guidance, which includes a lot of useful information for teachers and pupils. And we run a professional development programme for teachers that is free of charge when courses are new, and then annually there is some charge for those events. And, in addition, I'm a governor of one of the schools that features in the video. So, item 2, then, today is our first session on the provision of textbooks and learning resources for pupils, which is a video of interviews with young people and teachers. The committee team has been out to take video evidence around Wales, and we're now going to watch the results of that on the screen. We'll move on now then to our evidence session, and I'm very pleased to welcome Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the Welsh government, Mike Ebbsworth, assistant director educational support, Welsh Government, and Philip Blaker, Chief Executive of Qualifications Wales, to the stage. gareth pierce: I think the question of translation is an interesting one. I think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that because, as I mentioned earlier, there are so many resources available digitally in either Welsh or English at the same time. Perhaps an interesting question is: is that source useful for teachers, being able to draw resources from two sources? Another interesting question, I think, is\u2014.The Welsh language, of course, is a language that is used in an educational context, but we are in a big world that's an English language world. I am very aware that many of the websites we refer to in our resources and many of our case studies, as was mentioned in that video, are available in English only. Therefore, it is important that we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating, and that we are able to discover them independently of each other. We have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the Welsh Government and we work closely with external translators and we use translation technology increasingly, which facilitates a great many things.",
    "The group discussed the need for a standard case design for the Welsh-language version of the textbooks, with the WJEC suggesting that it would be a good idea to have a single case for the English-language versions of the materials, as it would allow teachers to use the same case for both the English and Welsh versions. The group also discussed the importance of having a standard design, with Gareth Pierce stating that it was important to have the same size and shape as the English version, and that the case should not be too big or too small. Gareth Pierce emphasized the need to ensure the quality of the case design, as there was a need for it to be easy to read and easy to understand. Gareth also highlighted the importance in the future of the Welsh language, with a focus on making it easier for teachers to understand it and to be able to incorporate it into their teaching. Gareth concluded that the focus should be on making sure that there are enough materials to meet the needs of the children and that they have the right content. He also highlighted that there is a great deal of work to be done to ensure that the materials are up-to-date, as well as ensuring that they are up to date in terms of their quality.",
    "sally jenkins: We know that there are a lot of people who are concerned about the impact of this Bill on children, and we need to make sure that we have a clear definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, and it's important to ensure that it is consistent with the principles of the Bill. However, it is important to recognise that there is a need for clarity in terms of the definition, as well as ensuring that the Bill is well-considered and well-thought-out, and that it reflects the needs of children and their families. We also need to be mindful of the importance of ensuring that this Bill is implemented in a way that respects the rights of the child and their right to equality and respect for their rights. We need to recognise the need for the Bill to be well-written, well-reasoned, and well thought-out. We have to be aware of the fact that this is a complex issue, and there are many different views on how to address it, but it is clear that there needs to be clarity, and the Bill needs to address the issue of how to achieve it. The committee has already heard different views about whether there's clear evidence that physical punishment is harmful to children. How do you respond to that view, and is what you're calling for essential to be on the face of the bill? huw david: It's not essential for it to be in the Bill, but we would like to see it incorporated into the Bill in the future. What we know is that children themselves, as Alastair has already referred to, really find physical punishment demeaning and harmful, and for children it is an emotionally damaging experience. I think what we would also say is that, in the world that we work in, it's part of a continuum, and, whilst this is an element of how children are cared for, what we see is a continuum where an acceptance of how we treat children in a particular way perpetuates throughout our work. So, for us, this is about a natural progression of change in how we care for our children in Wales. For children's services at the very sharp end of this world, it brings a true clarity. This continues with an ambiguity in the way we treat our children and how we think about care, and this shift for us brings that very much needed clarity. We've had evidence from the equal protection network that the reasonable punishment defence undermines child protection and fails to protect children because it permits an arbitrary level of violence, which invades children's physical integrity, making it a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse, and you did refer to that just now. It is about how we see our smallest and most vulnerable people, and if it is acceptable it opens the door to those other, more extreme versions of violence. The current legislation has been criticised, obviously, by the UN concerning the defence of reasonable punishment still being within our current legislation, so, we will always\u2014ADEW will always \u2014ADEW would always\u2014advocate that the Rights of the Child be upheld, so that is really the fundamental aspect of the statement from ADEW and the position of ADEW. I know that the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Measure 2011 made sure that article 3 and article 4, article 12 and article 37 were a focus in terms to making sure that the best interests of children were put first, that children expressing their views and opinions was a priority. And we know, for safeguarding purposes, that the express opinions of the children and expressing their opinions are a fundamental part of any safe environment, whether it be a school or college. If we're to progress with this, that has to be an option that is offered to every parent in Wales; that is\u2014the position is really following that legal position under the Human Rights of Children and Young Persons (Welsh) Measure. Nothing to add at this stage, no? alastair birch: Bore da\u2014bore da, bawb.",

They also expressed their desire for a simple and easy-to-use remote control that could be easily understood by the user, and it was decided that the team would design a simple remote control with buttons on the left and right sides of the screen, with buttons for volume, volume, and power, and a power button for volume control and a volume button for power. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a button for the volume control, which would allow users to turn on and off the TV by pressing one button at a time, but the team decided to focus on a single button for now, as this would be the most cost-effective for the budget-conscious user.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, and Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government, presented their views on the amendments to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. They highlighted the need for a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the change in the law, as well as the need to ensure that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. They also highlighted the importance of ensuring that children are not punished due to their age, as this could affect their employment opportunities.",
    "Members of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic have raised concerns about the lack of adequate funding for the coronavirus pandemic, and they are calling on the government to provide additional funding to address the crisis. Additionally, they call on the Minister of Health to ensure that there are adequate resources available to meet the needs of those affected by the pandemic. They also call on him to ensure the safety of patients and their loved ones. They call for a review of the government's response to the crisis, as well as an update on the situation in the province. The committee will meet again on March 31 to review the situation and determine the next steps to be taken. They will also meet with representatives from the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador to discuss the future of the province's health-care system and the need for more funding for hospitals and other health-related services. Lastly, they will meet with the minister of public health and support services to ensure a safe and effective response to this pandemic and ensure the health of all Canadians. The meeting will be chaired by the Speaker, who will be joined by the chairperson of the special committee and the chair of the parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister. The chairperson will be assisted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government of Canada, who is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of the members of the committee and their families. the chair: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for convening this meeting, and we look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the resilience of Quebeckers concerned for their jobs or their businesses during the CO VID-19 crisis. That is why the Bloc Qubcois is demanding that the government present an economic update, and that it do so before June17. In closing, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister. I am talking about the tech giants, the GAFAM group, that have never before been used to the extent that they are now, and are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Peel region police, paramedic and firefighting services for keeping Bramptonians safe. Organizations such as the Khalsa Aid Society, the Interfaith Council of Peel, the Brampton YMCA, the Prayer Stone Peoples Church, Unity in the Community, Ste. Louise Outreach Centre, Knights Table, the Yogi Divine Society, Vraj Community Service, Regeneration Brampton and many more have made our community stronger during this difficult time. Like many Canadians, I was shocked by this report from the long-term care centres, including one in my riding. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C, to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. They include residents being given expired or improper doses of medication; not being cleaned or changed for a prolonged period of time; being forcibly fed, causing choking; being bed-bound for weeks; receiving inadequate nutrition, and much more. I call upon Premier Ford to place these five homes under a mandatory management order and to appoint a third party manager to address and rectify these violations. I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-time care facilities across Ontario.",

The project manager emphasized the importance of having a simple design, as it would make it easier for users to use the remote and would be easier for them to understand what they were doing and what they needed to do. However, the user interface was concerned about the cost of the remote, as they would have to pay for a new remote control, which would be expensive. The industrial designer agreed that the price of the product should not be too high, but they would need to make sure that the product was not too expensive, as there was no guarantee that the user would be satisfied with the price. They also wanted to ensure that the cost would be reasonable, as the product would be more expensive if the price was too high. The team agreed that it was important for the price to be affordable, and they were confident that it would not cost more than $20 USD, which was the target price for the product.",
    "The Welsh bac was introduced in 2012 as a vocational qualification, with the aim of providing students with the skills they needed for employment, but it has since evolved into a qualification that is increasingly being used as a career qualification. However, it has been criticised by employers, who have expressed concerns about the quality of the qualification, as well as the lack of support from schools and colleges, and the need for more support from employers. In response to these concerns, the Welsh baccalaureate has been the subject of a review by the Welsh government, with a view to improving the qualification in the future. The aim is to ensure that it meets the needs of employers and that it is accessible to all Welsh students, and it is aimed at ensuring that students have the right skills for employment opportunities.",

The group agreed that the design should be simple, simple, and functional, and that the user should not have to deal with a lot of complicated buttons. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be small enough to fit in a purse or purse pocket, and it should be easy for a person to hold, as it would be easier for them to hold it in their hand. The project manager agreed with this idea, and agreed that it would not be too difficult to use the remote, as long as it was not too heavy or bulky. They also agreed that there should be no buttons on the remote except for the power button and the volume button, as these would be the only buttons that would need to be used. The team also agreed on the need to keep the design simple, as they wanted to avoid having too many buttons, and they also wanted to minimize the amount of buttons, as there would be too many of them, as well as having a small number of buttons for each channel. The Industrial Designer proposed the idea of using a small button on the right side of the screen, which was met with skepticism from the User Interface team, but the Project Manager agreed to it, as he believed that the buttons would be easily accessible from the back of the TV and that it wouldn't be too hard to find.",
    "The team discussed the importance of having a good understanding of the user's preferences and preferences, as well as their preferences, and they discussed the possibility of using the remote control to control the display, with the aim of making it easier for the user to navigate to their desired destination. The team also discussed the concept of a \"tourist\" and a \"visitor\", and the possibility to use the remote as a guide to find the location of the destination. They also discussed how to make the remote easier to use, with a focus on making the remote accessible to the user, and the idea of using it as a remote control for navigation. The group discussed the feasibility of using a voice synthesizer for the presentation, as it would be easier than using a speech synthesizer, and suggested that the remote could be placed on the left side of the screen to be more easily accessible. The idea of having the remote on the right side was also discussed, and it was decided that the user would be able to use it for navigation purposes, as they would be more likely to find their way to their destination if the remote was placed in the right place. Grad c: So the idea was to have the remote in the middle, and then the user could use it to move around and interact with the remote. Grad b: I think it's a good idea to have it in the center, because it'll be easier for people to find it. grad b: Yeah, but I don't know if they'll be interested in it or not. grad c: I'm not sure if they're going to be interested, but if they are, I think they'll want to see it. We'll see if they like it, and if they don't, we can change it to something else. Grad d: We have to decide whether or not we want to change it, but we're not sure whether it's the right time of day or not, so we'll wait and see what happens.. So the thinking behind that was we have the features that we ''ve drawn from the communication of some Like, the someone s The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea, like \" I ''m \" the the abstract idea being \" I am a tourist I want to go to this place. So then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour, running an errand, or whether they were in a hurry, because we were thinking, if they were IN a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th grad c. There ''d be less likelihood to like, but there ''d still be a chance to like it if they liked it, or if they didn't like it.

The Industrial Designer proposed that the buttons should be placed on the right side of the remote, while the user interface suggested making the buttons on the left side, as they would be easier to reach and easier to hold. The project manager suggested that they should be able to control the remote with the right hand, but the industrial designer suggested using the left-handed button, as the left hand would be more ergonomic. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a push button for volume, but they ultimately decided to go with the rubber material as it was cheaper and more durable than rubber. They also decided to use a rubber rubber band to hold the remote in place, with the idea that the rubber band could be easily removed if needed. The industrial designer also suggested the use of rubber as a material, as rubber is more flexible than rubber and it would make the remote easier to handle.",

We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), discussed the challenges facing universities in Wales, including the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds on the sector, as well as the challenges faced by the universities. He also highlighted the need for universities to invest more in research and innovation, and the importance of investing in the future of the sector. He explained that there was a need for the sector to invest in the education system, with the aim of ensuring that universities have the capacity to meet the needs of their students, and that the sector would be financially sustainable in the long term. He added that universities would be able to meet their obligations to their students in the next academic year, but they would need to ensure that they had the resources they needed to do so. He concluded that the universities would have to work closely with the government to ensure the sustainability of their budgets, and they were confident that they could meet the challenges they faced in the coming years. He said that the government would continue to support the sector in the short term, but that they would also need to work with universities in the longer term to ensure their financial stability.",

The Industrial Designer also suggested using an integrated circuit to power the remote, with the idea that the user would be able to control the remote by pressing a button on the back of the device. The User Interface Developer emphasized the need for a user-friendly remote control that would be easy to use and easy to understand, with a simple design that would make it easier for the user to find the remote. The user interface designer suggested that the remote should be simple in terms of design, with buttons on the left and right sides, and that the buttons should be placed on the right side of the remote to make it easy to find. The industrial designer also suggested the use of a battery as a power source, as there is no need for batteries to be expensive, as they can be easily found easily. Additionally, the industrial designer suggested the inclusion of a rechargeable battery, as this would allow for a longer battery life, as well as the possibility of using the same battery for multiple functions at once. However, the user interface team emphasized the necessity for a simple and simple design, as the user should not have to deal with a complicated remote control as they would have to spend a lot of time and energy to find it. The team also discussed the feasibility of incorporating a battery into the design, considering the cost of the battery and the potential impact on the user's battery life. The Project Manager emphasized the benefits of a simplified remote control and suggested that it could be used for a variety of functions, including turning on the television, turning on and off, changing channels, adjusting volume, and turning on/off, among other functions.",
    "meilyr rowlands: I think that there are a lot of things that we can do to improve the performance of children who are eligible for free school meals, but we need to be careful not to over-prioritise, because we want to make sure that we are targeting the right children, and we want them to be able to access the funding. I think it's important to recognise that there is a need for more support for the more able and talented children, because they are the ones who are most likely to benefit from the grant, and they are also the ones that are more likely to be successful in the future. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there's some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. You referred to the fact that it is used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are enrolled in schools, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable. It was being spent on children who were underachieve achieving, and one of the things we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children with disabilities, because those numbers are equal. However, we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meal funding, and I think we should be seeing examples of schools that are using the grant to support more able children, but they are not using it for children who need extra support. So, I think there is an opportunity for schools to use the grant in a different way, but I think they need to do it in a way that is more effective.",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to note that the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 was passed by the Welsh Assembly in 2015, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Kirsty Williams AM, has been responsible for the implementation of the Act, and she has been in charge of implementing the Act since then. However, the Minister has been working closely with the Welsh Government to ensure that the Act meets the needs of the sector, as well as the interests of the students, and we are currently working on a new Bill, which will be published in the coming weeks. The Minister for Higher Education has also been working with the Education Minister to develop the new legislation, which is expected to be published by the end of the year, and it is hoped that it will be introduced in the first half of next year. Kirsty has already started work on the Bill, with the aim of introducing it in the second half of 2019. The Ministry of Education is currently considering the introduction of a new Higher Education Act to regulate the higher education sector in Wales, and Kirsty is also working on the creation of a commission for higher education in Wales.",
    "Angela burns am: So, let's start with a question about the financial situation of the universities in Wales, because we know that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we have seen a rise in the number of students leaving the sector in recent years, and there are concerns about the sustainability of the sector as a whole. dr david blaney: We are seeing a significant increase in the amount of money that the universities have to spend, but we are not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage, and they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly. And we are seeing that at the moment. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. Before the Diamond review, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs. And there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme and the universities' superannuation scheme as well. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. We have to understand, though, that taking out costs to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacities of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. And so, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have. The costs of those borrowings have to meet on an annual basis, so those costs are becoming increasing proportionally, and that is increasing the cost of operating costs. angela burns Am: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students\u2014it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the Universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before. bethan owen: We can get you that analysis, but I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that Universities have.",
    "The group discussed the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on children and young people in Wales, as well as the impact on the health and social services system, with the Minister for Health and Social Services stating that they were concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on young people. They also discussed the need to ensure the safety of children and their families, and the importance of ensuring that the health system is up-to-date on all aspects of the pandemic. The group also discussed how to address the issue of how to deal with the outbreak, with a focus on how to ensure that children are not exposed to the virus and how to prevent the spread of the virus to others. The team discussed the possibility of using the sample sensor to test the effectiveness of the vaccine, as it was found to be effective in preventing the transmission of other viruses, including influenza and measles, and it was also found to have a positive effect on the immune system.",
    "Meilyr rowlands: I think that there are a lot of things that we can do to improve the performance of these children, but we need to be careful not to over-prioritize them, and we have to make sure that they have the support they need to achieve their goals. I think it's important for schools to be aware of the importance of this grant, and they have to ensure that they are using it in a way that maximises the impact of the grant. However, there are some schools that are not using the grant effectively, and there is a need for them to focus on the more able and talented children, and I think they are doing a good job of doing that. I also think that it is important that schools are aware of this issue, because it is a very important issue for the future of education in Wales. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. You referred to the fact that it was used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable. It was being spent on children who were underachieve achieving, and one of the things we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children with disabilities, because those numbers are equal. So, we look at the different performance of boys and girls, free and non-free school meals and ethnic minorities, to see if they are underachieving, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests. I believe that this data will be very useful, because what that data can do is help secondary schools to identify more able children and to identify those children who are underperforming, and to help them to improve their performance. In terms of what schools are doing with the grant, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things they're doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they have got Families at Brackla, and it's a range of activities to engage with families. They're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy.",
    "Hefin David am: I think it's important to understand that there are a lot of people who are going to be affected by this, and we need to make sure that we have a plan in place to deal with them. Hefin david am: So, for example, there are people who want to pay for childcare, but they can't afford it. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, they can pay for it, and they have the option to pay more, but if they don't have the money, they'll have to pay a fee, which is going to cost them more than they would have paid if they didn't have it. But, if they do, they will be reimbursed by the government, and if they're not reimbursed, they won't be able to access it. So, it's not only about the cost, but it's also about the quality of the service, and it's about making sure that it's accessible to all families. hefin david AM: What are the challenges that you're facing in terms of the cost of the services, and how do you plan to address them, and what are some of the challenges you're currently facing? huiw irrananca-Davies Am: There are some challenges, such as the cost and the complexity of the process, but we're trying to work out how to address those issues, and I think we'll have a better understanding of the issue by the end of the year.",
    "Phd A: Okay, so we're going to start with the on-line and phase normalization, and we'll see if we can find a way to minimize the amount of time it takes to get from zero to zero, and then we'll use the on - line and phase recognition to reduce the number of times it takes for the signal to reach zero. Phd C: I think it would be a good idea to use this method, because it would allow us to get a better understanding of what's going on in the speech, and it would give us a better idea of what we need to do to improve the quality of the speech. Professor B: We have a lot of work to do, but I think we're in a good place and we're on the right track.. professor b: So, we we got an improvement, in word error rate, training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of, six percent to four point five percent, on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F, but, the near- mike performance worsened, from one point two percent to two point four percent.., you're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation, but because you have these non - causal windows, you're getting these funny things coming in, at n And, what if you did?, there's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original, according to some equation. professor B: And one of the things you could do is, you could have some sort of VAD - like thing grad e: Professor b: and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some, very low or or near zero value., I\u2019m just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you ''re hearing are, yeah, I would use TIMIT.. So if you imagine a a waveform that's all positive, which is the time trajectory of energy, and, shifting it downwards, and then got rid of the negative parts, that '\u2019s essentially throwing away the low- energy things., and if it's a low energy compo portion, you might actually hear some funny things.",

Professor c: So we're going to have to find a way to reduce the amount of time it takes to get from 0 to 100 milliseconds to 0.5 milliseconds, and then we'll be able to reduce it to less than a tenth of a second. Professor C: So it would be interesting to see how long it takes for the neural network to get back to the user, and whether it would take longer or less time to get it back to them.. A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between, you know, a quarter of a split second and a hundred milliseconds, and I'm not even sure if we can distinguish between a quarter and a half a second, but I think we can do it. professor c: Yeah, I think it's important to know what the difference is between a half second delay and a quarter second, and I think that we can get it down to about a tenth.., I think the best systems so, everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system, which is something actually, we've done a lot over the last thirteen years. And the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay, and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the IIR filters. phd a: Okay, so we'll see if we could reduce the delay from sixty to sixty-four milliseconds to eighty-five milliseconds, which would be equivalent to the difference in latency between the low and high frequencies.",

So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it, do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting, phd F: What what kind of what does that look like? The string that you type in.. professor b: And then does it play something back or that's something you're having to program? grad H: right now, I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools, professor b, but it would probably be better to have it on a USB or USB-to-USB or something like that.

Hefin David am: What are the implications of this pilot project and how do you see it impacting the early years? julie morgan am: Well, we're looking at a lot of different options, and we're trying to find the best way to integrate them all together, but we're also looking at how we can integrate them together and how they can work together to achieve the best outcomes for children and families, and that's what we're working on. hefin david is: And what are the challenges that you're facing in terms of finding the right way forward, and how can you address them? jo-anne daniels: I think it's a challenge, but it's probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of our most important things we do, because we want to make sure that children have the best start in life for children, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded. And, of course, we have to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. So, we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children, and so, we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And we have been working with local authorities to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how to reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes, but ultimately, we are looking at ways of making it simpler and easier to understand, so we are working with the local authorities and health boards to see if we can actually work together and simplify things. sian gwenllian am: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014? Jo-anne DANIELS: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the greatest experience that they can have in the early childhood. And you've just said you want to simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen?

    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating the person in Grenada into the project, with the idea that they would be able to identify the person through their speech, and the team agreed that the person would be a good fit for the project. The team also discussed the importance of having a person in the group, as it would be easier for them to understand the context of the conversation, as well as for the team to understand what the person was saying and what they were trying to achieve. The group agreed that it was important to have a person who was familiar with the language, as they would have a better understanding of the person's intent, and they would also be more likely to be more willing to listen to the person. They also agreed that there was a need for the person to be familiar with a language, and that the team would need to find a way to make the person familiar with it more accessible to them. They proposed the idea of having the person take a picture of the object in the center of the room, but the team was skeptical about the feasibility of this idea, as there were concerns about the cost and difficulty of implementing it. However, the team decided to go ahead with the plan, as long as they were confident that they could meet the cost of the project and that they had enough time to complete it. They were also confident that it would not be too difficult to incorporate the person into the team, as the team had a good idea of what they needed to do in order to achieve the goal of creating a user-friendly environment. The idea was to have the person sit in a chair with a microphone on the right side of the table, with a mic on the left, and a microphone in the middle, while the person on the other side would have the microphone on their left. The person would have to hold the mic on their right hand, with their left hand facing away from their mouth, and have their mouth open, and their mouth at the corner of the microphone. The microphone would be placed in front of their mouths, and there would be microphones on either side of their mouth to allow them to hear what they wanted to hear, but they would not have to look directly at the microphone, as their mouth would be too close to their mouth. They would also need to have their hands on the microphone to hear it, but not too far away from the mouth, so that the microphone would not interfere with their speech.",

I think there's a lot to be done to ensure that people have the skills they need to be successful in the workplace, but we need to make sure that they have the support they need in order to do so. Kirsty, what do you think is the best way to address the issue of teacher recruitment and retention in Wales? Kirsty Williams am: Well, I think the first thing that we can do is to look at how we can increase the number of people who are qualified to teach through the medium of Welsh, and that's what we're trying to do. We've got a number of different options for people to choose from, including a part-time PGCE, a vocational certificate in education in education, a diploma in education management, and a postgraduate certificate in higher education. We're also looking at whether there is a place for people who want to do a PGCE in education but can't afford to pay for it, or whether they want to take a year off from work, or if they just want to focus on their education. I'm sure that there will be a lot more to come in the next couple of years, but, for now, we're focusing on the first two options, and then we'll see where we go from there.",

They also believed that the device should be simple in design, and that it shouldn't have too many buttons or buttons on it, as they could be easily overlooked by the user. The user interface team agreed that it was a good idea to have a simplified remote control, with fewer buttons and a simpler design, but they were concerned about the cost of developing a new design. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition feature into the remote, with the Industrial Design team believing that it would cost less money and be more cost-effective, while the Marketing team believed that it could be used in the future. The Project Manager suggested that a simple remote control would be the most cost-efficient, as the user wouldn't have to spend a lot of time and energy to learn how to use it. The Marketing team agreed, and they proposed that the project manager and Industrial Designer would be responsible for designing the remote with a simplified design and a simple price point. The project manager agreed with the marketing team regarding the price point and the cost, as well as the need for a simple and simple design.

Professor C: I think we can do that, but I don't know if we'll be able to do it, because it would require a lot more time than we would like to spend on a single filter. We'll have to decide whether or not to change the filter, but if we do, we'll try to minimize the time needed for the filter to reach the user. Phd a: So, for example, if we were to take a picture of a person's mouth, we'd have to take the picture, and if we took a picture, we would have to wait for the person to look at the picture to see what they were looking at, and then we'd compare it to the picture and see if there was any difference in the quality of the picture.

The project manager agreed with this idea, stating that the main function of a remote control should be to turn on and off the television, and that it shouldn't be too complicated. The group agreed that it was important for the remote to be user-friendly, as it should not be too heavy or too bulky, and it should have a simple look and feel. They also agreed that the device should be small and simple, with buttons on the left and right sides of the screen, and they would like it to be easily recognisable, as well as having the ability to change channels easily. The team agreed that there should be a small button at the top to activate the remote and a large button to turn off the TV, as this would make it easier for users to find the channel they want to watch. However, the team was concerned about the cost of the device, as they wanted to avoid having to pay for a separate remote control for each channel, which would be costly. The Industrial Designer suggested that a simple remote control would be the most cost-effective, but the Project Manager emphasized the need for a more complex design, as the remote would have to be more complex than a simple one. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer on the need to have a more complicated design, but they were unable to come to a consensus on how to achieve that goal.

They also discussed the possibility of using the remote as a stand-alone device, with the idea that it could be placed in the center of the TV to be easily accessible, and they would be able to control it with a single button. The project manager also mentioned that they were looking for a way to incorporate the power button into the remote itself, but they were unsure about how to achieve this, as there was a lack of consensus on how to do it. The user interface team suggested the idea of using a remote with an infra-red color, but the team was not sure if this would be a viable option, and it was decided that the team would need to design a new remote with a different color for the next meeting.",

    "The government acknowledged the challenges faced by the tourism industry in Canada and what measures did the government take to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, with the government taking steps to ensure that tourism was not negatively impacted. The government emphasized the importance of tourism to the economy and the need for the government to ensure the safety and security of Canadians. They also emphasized the need to protect the health and safety of Canadians, with a focus on ensuring that the government was aware of the challenges facing the tourism sector and taking appropriate action to address them. They called on the Government of Canada to take immediate and effective action to protect Canadians from the effects of pandemic-related events. They highlighted the challenges posed by climate change, noting that the average household income in Canada is less than $1,000 per month, and the government must ensure that Canadians have access to affordable and accessible health care. They are calling on the Prime Minister to prioritize the creation of a government-funded program to support Canadians affected by pandemic preparedness and recovery. The petitioners also call on the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to provide additional support to Canadians who have lost loved ones due to natural disasters. They call for the Government to provide support to the families of those affected by natural disasters, and for the Canadian government to provide assistance to those who have been affected by disasters, as well as for those who are in need of assistance. They urge the government not to take any unnecessary steps to limit the amount of time they can spend with their loved ones, and to provide them with the support they need to recover and to ensure their safety. The Prime Minister is committed to ensuring the safety of all Canadians, including those with disabilities and those with mental health issues. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Minister of Innovation, Innovation, Science, and Economic Development, and Minister of Science, Innovation and Procurement, Ralph Goodale, are committed to supporting the government's efforts to address these challenges. They acknowledge the challenges that Canadians are facing and call on them to work together to address the challenges they face. They highlight the challenges the government is facing in meeting the needs of Canadians in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and their concerns about the impact on their families and communities.",
    "The team discussed the design of the remote control, with the user interface designer suggesting a simple design with a simple look and feel, while the project manager suggested a more sophisticated design with an industrial design, with a focus on ergonomics. The industrial designer emphasized the need for ergonomic design, and the marketing team emphasized the importance of a user-friendly remote control that would be easy to use and easy to understand. The project manager proposed the idea of using rubber as the material for the remote, and suggested that the user could use the rubber as a rubber band to hold the remote in their hands. The user interface suggested using rubber instead of rubber, as it would be easier for the user to hold it in one hand and not have to use their other hand. The team agreed, but the industrial designer insisted on using rubber for the rubber band, as he believed that the rubber would be more durable than rubber, and that it could be used for other purposes, such as heating and cooling. The marketing team agreed with the idea, as they believed that rubber was the most durable material, and they would be able to use it for a variety of functions, including heating, cooling, and heating. They also agreed that the design should be aesthetically pleasing to the user, as the remote should not be too bulky or too bulky, and it should be simple to hold in the palm of the user's hand.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer agreed that the remote control should be simple, simple, and easy to use, and that it should be easy for the user to find the channel they want, as well as easy to understand. The project manager proposed the idea of a remote control that could be used to control the TV, and the user interface agreed to the idea. However, the project manager expressed concern about the cost of the remote, as it would be difficult to design a new remote control with a large number of buttons. The user interface suggested that the design should be based on the user's preferences, with a simple design that would be user-friendly and simple to use. The industrial designer proposed that the user should be able to choose from a list of channels, with the option to choose between different channels, or to select from different channels based on their own preferences. The team agreed that a simple remote control would be ideal for the job, as the user would not have to search for the channel, and they would not need to look at the remote to find it. They also agreed that it would not be too expensive, as there would only be a small amount of money to spend on the project, as they would only have to pay for a small part of the cost. The group agreed on the need for a simple and easy-to-use remote control, and it was decided that the industrial designer would be responsible for the design and user interface, while the Project Manager would be in charge of the technical aspects of the project. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to have a small remote control because it will be easier for people to use and it will make it easier for them to control their TV. The Project Manager agreed with this idea, as he felt that it was a good way to introduce a new type of remote control to the market. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer on the importance of having a user friendly remote control and the need to be simple and simple. The Industrial Designer proposed the concept of a user interface that would allow users to easily navigate to the channel of their choice, and User Interface agreed to this idea.",
    "I'm very pleased to welcome Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, Estyn; Jassa Scott, Strategic Director at Estyn, and Claire Morgan, strategic director at EstYN. Thank you for the papers upfront, in which you say that the most striking feature of the education system, looking forward, of course is the curriculum and the change that that's bringing. How can we be sure that, during this period of change, standards don't slip? And also, from the point of view of scrutiny, will we be back in a situation where we're being told, 'You can't compare one set of results against the previous year's results, because of the nature of the change'? meilyr rowlands: Bore da, bawb. I think this process of reform has been going on in the background for a few years now, so I think there is a track record of standards and provision not slipping. So, overall, I think we can be fairly confident that standards won't slip during the period of preparation. suzy davies am: Can I just ask: is that based on your evidence around primary schools, where the sort of ethos that we've seen in the curriculum has been already articulated through the foundation phase?",
    "Meilyr rowlands: I think it's important to remember that we have a lot of work to do, and we have to be careful not to get too hung up on the fact that there's a difference between the primary and secondary schools, because there are many different types of schools, and it's not just the primary schools that are affected by the new curriculum, but also the secondary schools as well. I think that there is a need to look at the whole system, and I think we need to make sure that we don't see any slippage in terms of standards and provision. We need to ensure that there are no bottlenecks in the system, but we also need to be mindful of the importance of ensuring that the system is in place for the future. suzy davies am: Okay, and on that point of comparing year on year, we will be able to make those comparisons legitimately then? Meilyr Rowlands: Yes, we can, and that's something that we're going to be doing in the next couple of years. I know that it's going to take some time for schools to get to grips with it, but I think they'll be well on their way, and they'll have the support they need to do it.",
    "The group discussed the need for a new design for the remote control, with the industrial designer stating that the idea of a banana-shaped remote control would be appealing to the younger market, while the project manager emphasized the importance of a simple design that would appeal to the older market. The industrial designer proposed the use of rubber as a material for the case, with a double-curved shape, and suggested that it would be easy to change the shape of the buttons to fit in the case. The project manager suggested that the buttons should be shaped like a banana, and the user interface suggested the addition of a button on the right side of the remote, similar to a banana's shape. However, the team agreed that the design should not be too complicated, as it would make it easier for the user to control the remote. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a remote control with a microphone and a speaker, which was suggested by the marketing team, who suggested using a microphone for the microphone and speaker, as well as a speaker for the speaker. They also suggested the inclusion of a speaker and a microphone on the front of the device, as they believed that a microphone would be more comfortable than a speaker on the back of a television. The group agreed to incorporate a microphone into the remote for easy access, and they also agreed to include a microphone in the remote to allow users to talk to the remote from the TV. The Industrial Designer suggested that a speaker should be placed on the left-hand side, and that the microphone should be positioned in the center of the screen, as opposed to the right-handed side, as this would be easier for users to reach.",
    "Hefin David am: I would like to start by asking Kirsty Williams AM to address the issue of whether schools will be able to reopen in the future. Kirsty williams am: It is important to note that we are currently in the process of assessing the impact of the pandemic on the education system, and we are working closely with the Department for Education and Skills to ensure that we have a plan in place to ensure the safety and security of children and young people. Hefin david am: So, Kirsty, could you elaborate on this? Kirsty Willams Am: I think it is important for me to make it clear that we will need to take a lead from our scientific and medical advisers, but from discussions that I've had with Universities Wales and vice-chancellors, they are very keen to be kept apprised of these approaches, because they may well wish to implement something similar within their own institutions. I've got a couple of supplementaries now; firstly, from Suzy Davies, and then I'm going to go to Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, who is group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty William AM, Minister for Education, Steve Davies, Director of the education directorate, and Huw Morris, Director, Skills, Higher Education and Lifelong Learning, to the meeting. I want to thank them for their support and understanding, and I look forward to working with them in the coming weeks to ensure a smooth and effective response to this pandemic. hefin david is: And could I just ask, with regard to the principles, do they then apply to further education and universities? kirsty Williams Am: Yes, they do apply to higher education, but they are not going to apply to universities, and they will only apply to schools and FE colleges.",
    "meilyr rowlands: I think that there are a lot of things that we can do to improve the performance of these children, but we need to be careful not to over-prioritise, because we have to make sure that we are not over-targeting them, and that we don't spend too much time on the children who are not eligible for free school meals. I think it's important to focus on the more able and talented children, because they are the ones who are most likely to benefit from the grant, and I think there is a lot to be done to ensure that they get the support they need. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. You've reported that the proportion of schools making effective use of the PDG remains around two thirds of secondary and primary schools, meaning that a third are still not using that funding effectively. Why do you think this is? meilyr Rowlands: It's a particular part of our inspection framework\u2014looking at the relative performance of different groups. So, we look at the different performance of boys and girls, free and non-free school meals, ethnic minorities, and we also look at performance of more able pupils in particular. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, but I think we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free meals. In terms of what schools are doing with the funding, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things they are doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they're trying to improve attendance, they are trying to work with families and the community in general, and they're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy. It seems to be a strong correlation between children who underachieve and that measure, so it is a strong measure, for example, For example, some people say that if you have received free school meal for a period of time and now you're not receiving them, then perhaps you should still be receiving the funding for another period. However, if you are not receiving the money, then you shouldn't receive the money for a longer period, and you should be receiving it for a shorter period. We will move on then to item 2 on our agenda, the continuation of our inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes, and evidence session 8. Would you like to introduce yourselves for the record, please?",
    "Phd A: Okay, so I was wondering if there was a way to reduce the amount of time it takes for the signal to reach the center of the spectrum, or if it would be possible to minimize the number of times it takes to get to the center, but it would require a lot of time to get there. Professor B: I think it would make sense to have a system that could be used for this purpose, because it would allow for a lot more control over the signal, and I think that would be a good idea. professor b: So, for example, if you were to use a voice synthesizer, it would have to be able to recognize the speech, but if it wasn't, then it wouldn't be possible, and if it was, you'd have to adjust the volume of the synthesizer to compensate for the loss of the signal. However, if it were to do that, then the signal would be too low and it would produce a signal that was too high, and that would make it difficult for the system to understand the speech. The team also discussed the possibility of using the TORRENT chip, which would allow the team to analyze the speech to see if there were any differences in the signal-to-noise ratio between the speech and the microphone, as well as whether there was any difference in the quality of the speech or not. The group also discussed how to address the issue of reverberation, with the idea that it was important for the group to be aware of the difference in quality between the signal and the noise, and how to minimize it.",
    "Phd c: I think it would be a good idea to increase the number of mixtures to five, but I don't know if it would make sense to increase it to six or not, because it would take a lot of time and energy to do it, and I think that it might not be practical to have five mixtures in the future. However, if I were to add a fifth mixture to the mix, I would have to adjust the amount of time it takes to add it, but if I did that, it would only take a few seconds longer to complete the experiment. The team discussed the possibility of adding a third mixture, but they were unable to find a way to incorporate it into the experiment due to the complexity of the task at hand. They also discussed the need for a new method to calculate the error rates of the different mixtures, as well as the importance of using different weights for different types of cases. Phd A suggested using a combination of different weights, with the goal of reducing the error rate of the mixtures by 50 percent and increasing the accuracy of the results. The goal was to reduce the error by 10 percent, with a goal of 20 percent, and the goal was for it to be 50 percent higher than the previous level. The idea was to use a mixture of three mixtures instead of just one, but the team realized that it was impossible to achieve the desired result, as there were too many mixtures and too many variables to fit into a single mixtures. The group decided to experiment with a single mixture instead of a single one, as it was easier to compare the results between the two, and they found that there was no significant difference between the results of the two mixtures. And right now actually there is a thing also, that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number. Phd c and Phd B discussed the idea of using a different type of weighting for each case, with Phd C saying that the goal would be to use the same weight for all mixtures regardless of the type of case they were working with, and phd B saying that it would not be possible to use more than one mixture in a single case.",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meal meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wales, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free school-meal counterparts. One of the things that they've used PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school, so, that's a universal thing that they have trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate increase in the number of eligible children, and now they're at the same level. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. llyr gruffydd am: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that it is being used properly?",
    "User Interface: Okay, we have a lot of ideas for the remote control, but we're not sure if we're going to be able to come up with all of them at once or if we'll have to break them down into smaller pieces. Industrial Designer: I think it would be a good idea to start with a simple remote control that's easy to use and easy to understand, and then we can expand on it later on. User Interface: Yeah, I think we should have a small remote control with a big button on the front and a small one on the back, so that it doesn't get in the way, and we can easily switch between different channels and functions. Industrial designer: I don't know about that, but I think that it would make sense to have a big remote with lots of buttons on it, and a smaller remote on the other side, so it's easier for people to reach and easier for them to reach. user interface: I'm not sure about that idea, but it would probably be a better idea than having a giant remote with a bunch of buttons, because it would take up too much space and it wouldn't be aesthetically pleasing. industrial designer: It would be nice to have something that's not too bulky, but not too heavy, and it would still be easy to carry around, and people could easily hold it in their hand and not have to lift it off the table, and there would be no buttons on the table. user Interface: We have to think about how we can incorporate all of the functions of the remote into a single remote, but at the same time, we don't want it to be too heavy or too hard to use. industrial Designer: We could have a remote that's really small and light, or we could have one that's a little bit bigger, but still easy to hold, and you can still use it comfortably. We could also have a bigger remote with more buttons on one side, or a smaller one with fewer buttons, or something like that. We also discussed the possibility of making the remote with different functions for different devices, and the project manager suggested that it could be used for different purposes, such as a remote control for the television or a remote for the telephone.",

The User Interface team agreed with this idea, as they believed that the user would be more likely to use the remote if it was easy to find and easy to use. They also agreed that the product should not be too bulky, as the user could easily find it easily, and they would not have to spend a lot of time looking for it, as a result.

The theme Proud of our traditions will be the focus of this celebration for the people of Montarlville. This is a good illustration of the rich history of this municipality nestled in the western foothills of Mont-Saint-Baseline. The seigneury of Montairville was granted in 1710 to the illustrious former governor of Trois-Rivires, PierreBoucher. The parish of St. Francis Xavier, which took root there and in which a village grew, became a municipal corporation in 1845. To this day, it is one of Canada's most prosperous localities with a strong sense of belonging, a very dynamic community life and jealously preserved natural environments. A whole program had been drawn up for the celebration, but the current health crisis has taken over some of the planned activities, which has in no way diminished the pride and festive spirit of the people. Chair, thank you for allowing me to take a moment to highlight an initiative that I started early on during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Heroes of Etobicoke-Lakeshore is an opportunity for citizens in my riding to recognize the contributions of those in their community who make life a bit easier. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out. I think of Daniel Lauzon who set up Food for Now, a mobile service that helps take care of the homeless. The increases to the GIS by $200, and $300 to the OAS, have been well received. They just want to highlight how important it is to support our seniors, in particular the poorest of our seniors. The chair: For members present in the Chamber, a reminder that they are asked to bring their petitions to the table. I remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of this special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, I ask that they please come and drop their signed certificates off at the table once the petition is presented. I would ask members to be very brief and concise, and to summarize the exact content of the petition. The first petition was from petitioners who are very concerned about our obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and our commitments under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action. They specifically reference the RCMP violation of UNDRIP in its actions on Wet'suwet'en territory and ask the Government to commit to actually living the principles embodied in the UN Declaration. I am presenting a petition on behalf of the one in a million Canadians who suffer severe and adverse effects from vaccinations. Even before the crisis, they would often share the hardships they faced on a day-to-day basis.",

The User Interface also suggested that there should be no buttons on the back of the remote, as it would be easier for the user to find them, and that the buttons should be easy to find, as they could be easily seen from the front of the device. The Industrial Designer proposed that the design should be based on the user's preference, with a simple look and feel, and a design that would appeal to a wide range of people. However, the Industrial Designer believed that the price of the product should not be too high, as there was no need to be expensive, as the cost would be absorbed by the user, and they would not have to pay extra for the product. Additionally, the industrial designer believed that it was important for the design to be user-friendly, as people would be willing to pay more for a remote control if they could afford it. The industrial designer also believed that there was a need for a new design that was unique to the product, and it was decided that the user interface would be the focus of the design. The user interface designer also suggested a new shape for the remote that would be more ergonomic, with rounded corners and a more modern look, but the Industrial Design team disagreed with this idea, believing that the shape would be too angular and that it would not be aesthetically pleasing to the user.",
    "The Welsh bac is considered to be an important qualification for Welsh students, as it prepares them for employment. However, it has been criticised by some employers, who feel that it does not meet their needs and that it is not aligned with the Welsh baccalaureate qualification, which they believe should be the focus of the qualification. They believe that it should be a qualification that prepares students for employment, rather than a vocational qualification, and they are concerned about the lack of support they receive from schools and colleges. They are concerned that it may not meet the needs of employers, and that they may not be able to find a place for their children in the workforce. They have concerns about the quality of the qualifications that are being provided to Welsh students. They feel that they are not adequately preparing their children for employment and that there is a need for more support for them. They also feel that there are other qualifications that can be provided to prepare them for work, such as vocational qualifications. They want to know what they need to do in order to be successful in their jobs, and it is important for them to have a good understanding of the skills that they need. They would also like to know if they are ready for work and whether they have the right skills for the job market. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications. But they want them to get their main qualification. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh Bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. nick brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bachelorette\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the Quality of skills within those professional sectors. So, I think it's important for us to make sure that we are providing the right qualifications for employers.",
    "The team discussed the idea of using the remote control as a remote control, with the idea that it could be used to control the TV, but the project manager suggested that the remote should be able to be used for a variety of purposes, such as turning on and off, adjusting the volume, adjusting volume, and controlling the volume slider, as well as controlling the power and volume of the TV. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker into the remote, as it would be easier for the user to see what's going on, and the team agreed to incorporate it into the design of the remote. However, the team decided to go with a single-curved case instead of a double curved case, as they believed that a double curve would be the most cost-effective. They also decided to use a rubber case for the push-buttons, which would be more cost-efficient and less expensive than using a plastic case. The project manager also mentioned that the team would like to use rubber for the buttons, but they were unsure about the quality of the rubber, as there was no guarantee that it wouldn't break, and they wanted to make sure that it was durable enough to last for a long period of time. Industrial designer: I think it's going to be a good idea to go for a double-curve case, but I don't know if it's gonna work or not. user interface: 'cause The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where, basically, you can program a sample wi That when you say something it will give a response, and you program the response as well. user Interface: It would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you said something and it turns the T_V_ on like, turn the T-V, and i turns comes on, but it's not that. industrial designer: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether or not we want to have a push-button or not, but we're not sure if we want a push button or not because we don't want it to break, but if it does break, we'll have to replace it with a different one. Industrial Designer: So we're gonna have to choose between two different options, and we'll decide which one is the right one, and then we'll make a decision on which one we want, but it'll depend on the cost of the product.",
    "The Project Manager discussed the need for a new design for the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting the idea of using rubber as the material for the case, and the Project Manager stating that they would like to use rubber as a material, as it is more durable than plastic. The Project Manager also mentioned the possibility of incorporating a touch screen into the remote, but they were unable to find a way to incorporate it into the design due to the cost constraints of the project. The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote should be shaped like a tomato, but the project manager suggested using rubber for the casing, which was met with skepticism from the Marketing team, who believed that it would be too expensive and would be difficult to produce. However, the team agreed that a rubber case would be the most cost-effective option as it could be used for a variety of reasons, including the cost of materials and the need to be environmentally friendly. The team also discussed the feasibility of a multi-purpose remote control that could be placed on the side of the remote to be easily accessible, as well as the potential for a single-use remote control. The project manager emphasized the importance of making the remote accessible to all users, and suggested that it should be easy to use and easy to find, with a simple design that would appeal to a wide range of people. The industrial designer suggested that a simple and simple design would be ideal for a simple remote control with no buttons or buttons, while the marketing team suggested a more complex design with buttons for different functions, such as the ability to control the volume, volume, and volume of the TV, and a power button for volume control. They also suggested the inclusion of a remote control button on the back of the device, which would be more affordable than a regular remote control and would allow users to easily find the remote. The marketing team also suggested incorporating a screen on the front of the product, which the industrial designer agreed to, although they were not sure if this would be practical or not. The Marketing team also proposed the addition of a microphone to the remote and suggested using a microphone for voice recognition, but it was suggested that this would not be practical due to cost constraints.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the need for a new design for the remote control, with User Interface suggesting the use of rubber instead of rubber for the buttons, and the idea of using rubber as a material for the handle, as well as a rubber case for the power button. The industrial designer suggested using rubber, as it is more durable than rubber, and User Interface suggested using a plastic case instead of latex, as they are more durable and less slippery than rubber. User Interface also suggested incorporating a remote control button on the left side of the remote, similar to the one on the phone, which would allow users to control the remote with their hands, while the project manager suggested using the right side for the volume and volume buttons. The project manager mentioned the possibility of incorporating a push button for volume, but the industrial designer pointed out that it would be difficult to incorporate it into the remote due to the size of the device and the cost of materials. The team also discussed the importance of incorporating the kinetic energy into the design, with the user interface suggesting that the remote should be made out of rubber or plastic, and that it should have a spongy material for a more natural feel. The user interface suggested the addition of a rubber cover for the button, which could be used to hold the remote in one hand and a rubber one for the other. The Industrial Designer also suggested the incorporation of a remote button for the voice recognition, which was suggested by the Project Manager, but User Interface argued that it was not practical, as the remote would be too heavy and it would require a lot of energy. The Project Manager agreed, and suggested that the user should be able to hold it in their hands and not have to worry about the weight of the rubber case. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer on the need to use rubber, but they were concerned about the cost, as rubber is more expensive than plastic and the rubber is not as flexible as rubber.",
    "The Industrial Designer and the Project Manager agreed that the idea of a remote control with a kinetic energy system was a good idea, as it would allow the user to interact with the remote by pressing a button, but the Industrial Designer was concerned about the cost of the product, and the project manager disagreed, as they believed that it would be too expensive. The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be able to adapt to the user's needs, and that it should be easy to change the shape and size of the remote, as well as the shape of the buttons and the color of the screen. The project manager agreed with this idea, believing that the industrial designer to be a good communicator, and they agreed on the need for a user-friendly remote control that would be user friendly and easy to use. They also agreed that it was important for the user interface to be aesthetically pleasing, with a simple design and a simple look and feel, but they did not agree on the amount of buttons needed to be placed on the remote. The industrial designer proposed that the design should be simple and simple, with only one button on each side and a single button on the right side, while the marketing team proposed a more complex design, with two buttons on the left and a third on the bottom, and a fourth on the top. The marketing team suggested that they would like to include a push-button on the side of the device, which would make it easier for users to find the right button, and it was decided that the button would be placed in the middle of the display. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a push button into the remote to make it more user friendly, with the idea that it could be used to turn the remote on and off by pressing the power button.",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we need to be mindful of these challenges, but I think that we are in a good position to address them, and I think we have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and it is important that we continue to work together to ensure that the sector is well-regulated. We have a good relationship with HEFCW, and they have been very helpful in their efforts to support the sector. I think they are doing a fantastic job in supporting the sector and supporting the students, and that's something that I think is very important. sian gwenllian am: Just turning to the issue of the remit letter, Kirsty, are you aware of the fact that there is a provision in the Act that allows the Minister for Education to regulate the higher education sector in Wales? Kirsty Williams AM: I'm aware of this provision, and the Minister has indicated that it will be incorporated into the new legislation in the new Bill. However, it is not clear whether this provision will be included in the Bill, or whether it will simply be added to the existing legislation, as it is currently in the process of being amended. We will be discussing this issue with the Minister in the coming weeks, but it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. So, it's our intention to supersede the current Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, which is currently being debated in the House of Lords, and to ensure a smooth passage through Parliament.",
    "Dr Frank Atherton explained that the target was based on the amount of sugar that was currently in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, and that the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. He also highlighted the importance of having a target in place, as it would allow the government to evaluate the impact of the campaign and ensure that it is being implemented effectively. He added that the government has the resources to achieve the target, but they need to be able to do so in a way that is cost-effective and cost-efficient. Dr Frank also emphasized the need for a strong evaluation of the program, as well as ensuring that it meets the needs of the Welsh Government and the public health system. Dr. Atherton said that the Government is working closely with the National Institute for Health and Social Care Wales and the Welsh government to ensure that the program is implemented effectively and efficiently.",
    "The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to establish a national program to provide free food for free-school-meal meals for children affected by the pandemic. They are calling for the government to ensure that all children receiving free meals are provided with a healthy diet, and they are asking for a review of the government's policy on school meals. They also call on the Prime Minister to prioritize the provision of free meals for school-aged children. The petitioners have also called on the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to ensure the safety of children and their families. They call for the Government to implement a national health plan for free school meals, and for the Ministry of Education to provide a plan for school meals to be provided to children who cannot afford to pay for them. They have also asked for a study to be conducted to determine the cost of providing free meals to school-age children, as well as to determine whether they need to pay extra for meals. The Prime Minister has agreed to consult with the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury Board of Canada regarding the implementation of this plan. The Minister of Education and Minister of Health has also agreed to provide additional funding to the school boards to provide meals to children in need, and to ensure their safety and well-being.",
    "The project manager explained that the new remote control was designed to be easy to use, easy to find, and stylish, and that it would be able to adapt to different shapes and sizes depending on the size and shape of the remote control, as well as the size of the keypad. The project manager emphasized the importance of being able to control the remote from different angles, with the aim of making it easier to find and easier to use. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a push button on the remote, which would allow users to easily switch between channels, and the idea of using the remote to turn on and off by pressing a single button, as opposed to having to press two buttons at once. The group agreed that the design should be simple, simple, and simple, with a simple design that would be easily recognisable to the user. They also agreed on the need for an ergonomic design, and suggested that the remote should be ergonomically shaped to fit comfortably into the hand, with buttons for volume, volume, power, and volume control, and a button for volume control. However, the project manager expressed concerns about the lack of ergonomics, as it was difficult to find a way to make the remote more ergonomic, as there was a lack of space between the buttons, and there was no way to hide the buttons. The user interface team agreed that there should be a way for the user to easily find the right button, and they proposed that the button should be placed on the right side of the screen, and it could be placed in the center of the device to make it easier for users to find it. The industrial designer also suggested the addition of a microphone, which could be programmed into the remote by the user, but they were unable to come to an agreement on whether or not to include it in the design of the product. They decided to leave it out of the final design, as they did not want to compromise on the quality of the design."
