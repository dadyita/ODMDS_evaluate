The group agreed that the new remote control would be visually appealing, but they were uncertain about the cost. Marketing emphasized that it was not necessary for the product to be expensive, as long as it did not exceed a certain price point. They believed that the product should not exceed twenty-five Euros. In order to meet this target, the team would need to raise the price of the remote to fifty Euros, which Marketing believed would not be feasible.",
    "The User Interface team emphasized the importance of a spongy material for the remote control, suggesting the use of rubber instead of titanium due to the cost constraints. User Interface also emphasized the need to replace kinetic batteries, as they were prone to breaking. The project manager agreed, but User Interface emphasized that this would require replacing the kinetic batteries. To address this issue, User Interface proposed the idea of replacing kinetic batteries in the future. The Industrial Designer agreed, stating that replacing the batteries would increase the cost of the project manager's remote control by a significant amount. The Project Manager agreed, emphasizing the need for a more reliable source of energy. The group then discussed the feasibility of using kinetic batteries to power the remote, which User Interface agreed to consider, but the Industrial Designer raised concerns about the cost. The team acknowledged the challenge of replacing all the batteries, and User Interface assured them that they would be able to do so.",
    "Marketing and the Industrial Designer disagreed regarding the use of kinetic energy, as the User Interface Designer believed that kinetic energy was unnecessary and unnecessary. The Industrial Designer emphasized the need for a kinetic energy source for the remote control, while the Marketing team believed that it was unnecessary. Marketing also raised concerns about kinetic energy being lost. The User Interface team emphasized the importance of a user-friendly remote control.",
    "Kirsty Williams AM raised concerns about the potential impact of HEFCW's powers to intervene in FE's decision-making process. Hefin David AM responded that the group would not be able to use their powers. Kirsty Williams added that HEFCw would have to act on their behalf if they did. Huw Morris clarified that the agency did not have the power to intervene, but they had the authority to do so if they wanted to. He added that they would be willing to use it if they needed to.",
    "Mark Reckless and Darren Millar were unable to attend the meeting due to work commitments. Suzy Davies AM raised concerns about the potential impact on their work. Kirsty Williams AM assured them that they would be able to attend. Hefin David AM clarified that they had not been replaced.",
    "The group discussed the impact of COVID-19 on children's physical education. Kirsty Williams emphasized the importance of physical education, emphasizing the need for physical education in schools. Dr. Frank Atherton emphasized the need to provide physical education for all children. Hefin David AM raised concerns about the lack of a physical education provision for children in schools during the pandemic, citing the challenges faced by children in school due to their limited physical activity. Dr Frank Atherton acknowledged the challenge of providing physical education to children and emphasized the value of physical instruction. Dr David AM clarified that the government was committed to ensuring that children had access to physical education regardless of their weight.",
    "Marketing emphasized the importance of an easy-to-use remote control, emphasizing the need for an ergonomic design. The group agreed that the new remote control should be easy to use and easy to locate, and User Interface agreed that it should be simple to use. However, they were not entirely convinced by the idea of a curved design. User Interface suggested that the remote control could be curved, as it would be easier to find. The project manager agreed, but the Industrial Designer raised concerns about the lack of ergonomics. The team agreed that a curved remote control would be more ergonomic than a flat one. The Industrial Designer emphasized that the curved design would make it easier to use, and the group agreed. The Project Manager emphasized the need to keep the design simple."
