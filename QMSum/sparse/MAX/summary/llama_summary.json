    "  The domains in the mental spaces refer to the different types of knowledge or information that are being processed and represented in the brain. The middle layer in the model is responsible for integrating information from various sources and representing it in a way that can be used by the higher-level cognitive processes.\n\nThe middle layer is functioning as a sort of \"meaning maker\" - it takes in various types of information, such as linguistic, visual, and auditory, and combines them into a unified representation of meaning. This process involves identifying the relationships between different pieces of information, such as synonyms, antonyms, and associations, and creating a mental representation of the meaning of a word, phrase, or sentence.\n\nThe middle layer also plays a role in the compositionality of language, allowing the brain to combine individual words and concepts into more complex expressions. It does this by representing the meaning of each word and concept in a way that can be combined with others, and by providing a way to represent the relationships between these meanings.\n\nIn addition, the middle layer is also involved in the process of semantic parsing, which is the process of understanding the meaning of a sentence and identifying the relationships between the words and concepts it contains. It does this by using the information it has about the meanings of individual words and concepts to interpret the meaning of the sentence as a whole.\n\nOverall, the middle layer is a crucial component of the language processing system, as it allows the brain to represent and manipulate meaning in a flexible and efficient way, and to understand the meaning of complex linguistic expressions.",

    "  The discussion centered on the financial sustainability of Welsh universities, particularly in light of recent demographic changes, the impact of the Augar review in England, and Brexit. David Blaney and Bethan Owen of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) highlighted the challenges facing universities, including a decrease in the number of 18-year-olds, a funding gap between Wales and England, and uncertainty around the Augar review and Brexit. They mentioned that universities are taking out cost one way or another, which has a detrimental effect on capacity and impacts people who lose their jobs immediately, as well as the medium to longer term impact on the system's ability to deliver for Wales. They emphasized that the introduction of the Diamond reforms is crucial and that the forthcoming year will see an increase in resource to higher education.\n\nAngela Burns asked about the university reserves, and Bethan Owen explained that there is a difference between distributable reserves and assets that universities have. She mentioned that universities have reserves, but a large amount is tied up in their estates and is not immediately realizable. Operating cash is a more important measure than surpluses and deficits, and universities generate about 7.6% of their income as operating cash, compared to nearly 10% for English institutions. The costs of servicing borrowings have to be met annually, and universities have invested in their estates, largely funded by borrowings.\n\nBlaney and Owen noted that the sector is under significant financial stress, and HEFCW monitors forecasts and meets frequently with universities to understand their latest position. They mentioned that the forecasts for 2018-19 indicated a break-even position, but pension costs have changed, and universities must build those costs into their forecasts at a time when fee income is not increasing. Blaney stated that he doesn't think any universities will be lost in the next couple of years, but there will be more cost-taking and job losses if the pressure continues unabated. Owen added that structural change within the sector is possible, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to a crisis.\n\nIn summary, the discussion focused on the financial challenges facing Welsh universities, including demographic changes, funding gaps, and uncertainty around the Augar review and Brexit. The panel discussed the impact of cost-cutting measures on university capacity and the importance of the Diamond reforms. They also addressed concerns about university reserves and the need for careful financial planning to meet operating costs, including borrowing servicing costs. Finally, they touched on the possibility of structural change within the sector, while emphasizing the need for managed and sustainable financial planning.",

She emphasized the importance of protecting universities' autonomy while ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability for public funding.\n\nRegarding concerns about university governance, Kirsty Williams noted that the Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. She acknowledged that there are different views about the effectiveness of the Act in achieving its strategic aims, but she remains committed to those principles in any legislation she brings forward.\n\nKirsty Williams also responded to concerns about private providers, explaining that the requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity means that alternative private providers cannot be regulated under the Act. She emphasized the importance of ensuring the quality, financial viability, and contribution to public good of private providers before designating their courses as qualifying for student support.\n\nFinally, Kirsty Williams addressed the issue of part-time fees and postgraduate fees, stating that she is currently content with the fee levels for part-time courses, as they are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. She also noted that there are difficulties in introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses, and that the success of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales is important to her.",
    "  The team discussed the financial sustainability of the higher education sector in Wales, particularly in light of recent press coverage and the ongoing challenges faced by universities. David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), and Bethan Owen, Deputy Chief Executive of HEFCW, provided evidence on the current state of the sector.\n\nBlaney emphasized that Welsh universities face significant financial challenges due to three main factors: the demographic dip in 18-year-olds, uncertainty surrounding the Augar review in England, and Brexit. These challenges have resulted in a funding gap between Welsh and English universities, with Welsh institutions being approximately \u00a340 million worse off.\n\nOwen added that the sector is under significant financial stress, with universities facing difficulties in generating cash to meet their costs, including the costs of servicing their borrowings. She noted that some universities have been able to invest in their estates through bond issues, but this has resulted in restricted cash balances that can only be used for specific purposes.\n\nIn response to a question from Angela Burns AM, Blaney stated that he does not believe any universities in Wales are at risk of collapse in the near future. However, Owen noted that forecasts indicate that the sector will continue to face challenges, with some universities managing their finances better than others.\n\nBurns raised concerns about the impact of structural change within the sector, citing the example of the University of Wales, Lampeter, which has announced course restructuring, staff losses, and concerns from students and parents about the sustainability of their three-year commitment to a course. Blaney acknowledged that such changes can be challenging for institutions to manage, but emphasized that HEFCW is not seeing a crisis in the sector.\n\nThe discussion highlighted the need for universities to manage their finances effectively, particularly in light of the ongoing challenges facing the sector. HEFCW monitors forecasts and meets frequently with universities to understand their latest positions and provide support where necessary. The council also emphasized the importance of protecting students' interests and ensuring that they are aware of any potential risks or challenges associated with their chosen course or institution.",
