Key user requirements, innovative features, materials, speech recognition, user-friendliness, and the overall marketing and corporate image were considered.",
    "The group's conclusions on LCD screens were that they decided not to include one in the remote control design due to budget constraints and the need for a more simplistic design. There was no mention of speech recognition in the meeting, indicating that it was not a priority or consideration for the design. The group did not discuss screen usage in detail, but it can be inferred that they decided against using a screen due to the simplicity of the design. Similarly, there was no mention of a spin wheel with an LCD display, suggesting that it was not considered as a feature. The group also did not mention FPGA in the meeting, indicating that it was not a consideration for the industrial working design.\n\nInstead, the group focused on the internal components of the remote control, such as the circuit board and chip, as well as the external design elements. They discussed the use of kinetic energy as an energy source, the possibility of interchangeable face plates, and the need for a user-friendly interface with basic button functions. They also decided to go with a trendy look and feel for the remote control but had doubts about incorporating fruit and vegetable themes. Ultimately, they agreed to explore more abstract designs inspired by fruits and vegetables.",
    "In the meeting, the industrial designer and user interface designer discussed their opinions and conclusions on work division, the difference between their roles, and component design for the remote control.
