They mentioned that they wanted to reduce the number of buttons and focus on user-centered design. They also mentioned the idea of a removable front for customization, while still maintaining the company's recognition. \n\nOverall, the meeting covered various aspects of the remote control design, including functionality, requirements, potential RSI concerns, and design considerations.",
        "During the meeting, the main topics of discussion were the design of the remote control, including the placement of buttons and the use of an LCD screen. The team discussed whether the LCD screen should be placed at the top or the bottom of the remote, with the industrial designer advocating for the top and the user interface team suggesting the bottom. They also discussed the number buttons and decided that they should recognize two numbers pressed in quick succession rather than having a separate button for each number. The team also discussed the importance of having a power button, channel buttons, volume control, and buttons for screen width and AV settings. They debated the inclusion of a button to go to the video channel, with some team members arguing it was unnecessary. Finally, they discussed the menu button and the inclusion of settings for brightness and contrast. The team did not come to a final decision on all aspects of the remote control design, but agreed to continue the discussion individually and reconvene later. The marketing team also mentioned the importance of considering repetitive strain injury (RSI) and the younger target audience's interest in features when designing the remote control."

        "The problem related to feasibility discussed in the meeting is the cost and market viability of the proposed remote control design. The project manager mentioned that the company aims to make at least fifty million Euros from the project and wants the remote control to have a sales price of twenty-five Euros with a production price of twelve and a half Euros. However, the marketing representative expressed concerns that this price may not be competitive in the market and suggested that the remote control should have added features to justify a higher price. One of the suggested features is speech recognition, which was found to be in demand among the target market of people aged fifteen to thirty-five. The user interface designer agreed with this suggestion but also highlighted the challenges of implementing speech recognition, such as filtering out ambient noise and avoiding false triggers. The industrial designer mentioned the importance of the look and feel of the remote control, as well as the need to make it easy to find. The user interface designer emphasized the need to keep the number of buttons to a minimum and make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed. Overall, it was decided to consider all the proposed features initially and then evaluate and eliminate them based on feasibility and user feedback."
