The Industrial Designer clarified that the cost of the product would be under forty Euros, and Marketing agreed that it would be within the company's budget. Marketing also emphasized the need for the product to be affordable, as they believed that customers would be willing to pay more for a remote control if they couldn't pay for a television set.",
    "The team has been working closely with the SPG schema, with the goal of creating a schema that can be applied to all types of data. To achieve this goal, they have implemented a schema for intermediate categories, allowing them to categorize them according to their schema. The team is currently working on creating a new schema that will be used for categorization purposes. This schema will be divided into three parts: intermediate, intermediate, and final. The first section will focus on the first two parts, while the third section will cover the second and third parts. The final schema will include the first and second parts, as well as the third and fourth parts.",
    "The Deputy Minister emphasized the importance of the Bill's duty to promote public awareness, stating that it was essential for people to be aware of the change in the law to ensure their understanding of the impact of the law. She also highlighted the need for the government to ensure that the Bill was not seen as a new offence. The Deputy Minister explained that the purpose of the bill was not to create a brand new offence, but rather to protect children's rights. However, the Deputy Minister acknowledged that there were concerns raised by some members about the lack of clarity on how the Bill would be implemented. She emphasized the need to ensure a balanced approach to the Bill, with a focus on the impact on children and their families. She highlighted that the government had already taken steps to implement the Bill and that there was no need for further action to be taken.",
    "The Welsh baccalaureate qualification has seen a significant increase in the number of placements in the past two years, leading to a significant improvement in the quality of teaching and learning. However, there is still room for improvement, as there is a significant gap between the performance of GCSEs and the bac. Kirsty Williams acknowledged that there was a need for further work to be done to address this gap. Philip Blaker emphasized the importance of ensuring that the qualification is not seen as a pass-or-fail qualification, as it is a qualification that should be taken seriously by students. He also highlighted the need to ensure that students are not discouraged from taking the Welsh bac if they are not satisfied with their GCSE or A-Level results. He suggested that the focus should be on ensuring that students have a good understanding of the qualification and that they do not feel that they are being punished for taking it. The focus should instead be on supporting students to gain the necessary skills and knowledge.",
