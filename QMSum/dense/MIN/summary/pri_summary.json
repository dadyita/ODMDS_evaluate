    "User interface: I think it would be a good idea to have a remote control with a lot of buttons, and I think that it would make it easier for people to find the remote control, and it would also be easier for them to find their remote control. Industrial designer: It would be nice to have the ability to control the remote by pressing a button on the remote, but it would cost a lot more money. User Interface: I don't think it's worth investing in a new remote control because we already have a bunch of them, but I think they would be very useful in the future. Industrial Designer: I agree with the user interface, but we need to find a way to reduce the cost of the product, as well as the time it takes to produce it. The project manager agreed with the industrial designer, and the group agreed that the cost would be too high, but they agreed on the need for a low-cost circuit board, which would allow them to focus on the design of the remote. They also agreed that they would like to use a simple design, with a simple and easy-to-use design, as opposed to a complex and complicated design. The industrial designer proposed the idea of a simple remote control that could be placed in the middle of the table, with buttons on the left and right sides, and a power button in the center. The user interface suggested that the power button should be placed on the right side of the device, and that the buttons should be positioned in a way that the user would be able to reach it easily. The remote control should be easy to use, and there should be no buttons on it, as it should not be too complicated to use. The team agreed that it was important for the user to be comfortable with it, and they wanted to minimize the amount of time they had to interact with the device. However, they were concerned about the cost, as they did not want to overcomplicate the product by having too many buttons and not enough buttons. The Industrial Designer suggested a simple, simple design that would be simple and simple, with only a few buttons, but the project manager disagreed, believing that the design should be more complex. The group agreed to include a button for each button, with the exception of the volume button, which could be controlled by the user.",
    "Kirsty williams am: Well, we have a lot of work to do to ensure that the curriculum meets the needs of the children, and we're working on that, and it's going to take us a long time to complete it, but we're going to do it in the next couple of years. So, there are a number of things that we need to work on, but the most important thing is to make sure that we have the right people involved in the process, and that they have the support of the government and the education minister. We've been working on this for a while now, and I think we're on the right track, and there's a lot more work to be done. sian gwenllian am: You've touched on the point that there's going be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the curriculum changes that we are proposing? Kirsty Willams am: The original proposal that we began working on was to provide for the four purposes\u2014the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a variety of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency. However, we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. We also held a series of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes. And what are the main messages that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. Kirsty Williams AM: Okay, we call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. In October, there will be a number more workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we will have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their input into the process. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire? claire bennett: Yes.",
    "The industrial designer and the project manager agreed that the remote control should be simple and easy to use, as it would be easy for the user to find the channel they want, and the user interface should be easy to understand.

User Interface: It would be nice to be able to control the remote with one hand, but I don't think it's practical to have too many buttons on it, so I think we should try to minimize the number of buttons. Industrial Designer: I agree with the user interface, I think the design should be simple and simple, and it should be easy for the user to use, but it shouldn't be too complicated. Project Manager: We need to find a way to make it easier for people to use it, and we're not sure how to do that, but we'll figure it out in the next meeting.. user interface: If you have questions project manager: If that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it was important to include video and D_V_D_, I could get back to them and see. user Interface: Yeah, and also it's it's other question is because there are so many different And there are SO many different Things that could possibly be included marketing: project Manager: User interface: because besides video, there are the video C-D-s and whatever, so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things, so it's going to be hard to choose which one to include. industrial designer: Are there any questions for Maarika before we go on to the next one? industrial designer, we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want, but so so at this stage, how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or in we can completely do away with buttons and have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But is is there any any thoughts on that? user interface said that they would have to make the buttons smaller, and the project manager agreed that this would be the best way to achieve that.",

    "The Project Manager and User Interface presented a concept for a remote control that would be able to control the remote control with the help of a button, and the Industrial Designer suggested that it would be more user-friendly than a traditional remote control due to the lack of buttons. However, the User Interface suggested that the project manager and Industrial Designer disagreed, with the Project Manager believing that the user interface would prefer a simple remote control, while the industrial designer believed that the product should be more complex. The Project Manager agreed with User Interface regarding the need for a more complex design, and suggested that a single-function remote control would be the most cost-effective, as it would not require a complicated circuit board. The Industrial Designer proposed the idea of having a single button on the front of the remote, which would allow the user to press the power button to turn on and off the TV, while User Interface emphasized the importance of a simple and easy-to-use remote control. The User Interface proposed that the remote should be easy to use, with a simple design that would allow users to control it with the touch of one finger.

Phd A and Phd B discussed the possibility of using a combination of the Wiener filter and the LDA filter, and they agreed that the latter would be the best way to address the issue. However, they were unable to agree on how to implement it due to the complexity of the code, and the need for additional work. They agreed that they would need to create a new version of the filter, which would be based on the results of the previous version, and that it would have to be more complex than the original version. They also agreed that there would be a need for a more complex version, as it would require additional work, but they were confident that they could come up with a solution that would be more efficient.",
    "Phd b: I think we have a lot of work to do, but I think it would be interesting to see if we can find a way to reduce the latency in the future. Professor c: So, for example, if we were to take a picture of a person's face, we would have to take the picture of their mouth, and we would be able to see how long it takes for them to react to the image, and then we could adjust the amount of time it takes to get it back to the user. Professor C: So it would take a couple of seconds to get the picture, but it would only take a few milliseconds for the user to see the image. We would like to get to a point where the user doesn't have to wait for the image to come back to them, and the user would only need to wait a few seconds to see it. However, if the user had to wait longer, they would lose the ability to use the feature stream, and they would be unable to use it. To address this issue, the team decided to add a filter to the system, which was designed by Professor C, and it was based on the idea that it would reduce the delay by a factor of ten. The team also decided to use a neural network to address the issue of latency, as they were unable to find a solution to the problem of having too much noise in the system due to the fact that there were too many people working on it.",

    "Phd f: I think it would be a good idea to have a bunch of people in the room, and I think they would be able to talk to each other and have a conversation about it. professor d: I don't know if it's possible to do that, but I think that it would make sense to do it. postdoc h: It would be interesting to see if there is a way to make it easier for people to understand what they're talking about, or if they would have to write it down on a piece of paper or something like that. Phd e: I'm not sure if there's any way to do this, but if there was, I think we would have been able to get a better idea of what they were talking about and what they wanted to talk about. professor a: Yeah, I'm sure there are a lot of people who would be interested in it, but it would take a long time for them to learn how to use it, and they would need to learn a lot more than they currently do. phd b: I was thinking about the idea of having people write down the names of the people who were in the meeting, but the idea was rejected by the professor because it would require too much time and effort.",
    "The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness announced that the government is working closely with the provinces and territories to address the issue of long-term care in Canada. They are calling on the Minister of Veterans Affairs and Veterans Affairs to ensure that the Government of Canada has a plan in place to ensure the safety and security of veterans and their families. They also call on the government to create a national program to provide support for veterans affected by the pandemic. The Minister of Seniors is calling for a review of the government's policies and programs to ensure they are in line with the needs of Canadians. They call for a comprehensive review of all existing programs and programs, including those that are currently in place, and for a new program to be created. They urge the Government to prioritize the implementation of these programs in consultation with provinces, as well as the provinces, and to ensure their implementation in a timely manner. The petitioners are also calling for the creation of a national network of support groups to provide information and support to Canadians who are affected by this pandemic, and they are asking the Prime Minister to support this initiative. The Prime Minister is aware of this issue, and he is committed to addressing it. He is also committed to ensuring that Canadians have access to the necessary resources to address this issue. The government is also working with provinces to implement a national strategy to address these issues, and the Minister is working with the Parliament of Canada and the provinces to address them. The Government is also collaborating with the Canadian Red Cross and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police to address concerns about the lack of adequate funding for mental health services in the province of Ontario. The Ministry of Health and Human Services and the Office of the Commissioner of Public Health are working closely together to ensure a safe and effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the families of those affected by it. I would like to express my appreciation for the efforts of the members of the House of Commons who have been working so hard to support their colleagues in this difficult time, and I look forward to the next meeting of the Special Committee. I understand that this meeting is being held in the coming days, and we will be meeting again on Thursday, April 25, 2019, to discuss this issue further. Chair, I'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton, Ontario, who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have signed similar petitions. Given that Canadians are living through unprecedented, catastrophic climate events, and at the same time our society, as you know, is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of Canadian families are only $200 away from insolvency in any given month. They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16. They cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted into the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl. They're calling for decriminalization of personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source. I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation for a national opt-out program.",
    "The Project Manager, User Interface, and Industrial Designer had a discussion about the design of the remote control, with the User Interface suggesting a simple and simple design, while the Industrial Designer suggested a more complex design, with a lot of buttons and buttons, and the Project Manager agreed. The Industrial Designer proposed a new remote control that could be used to control the remote, with buttons for volume, volume, power, and volume control, as well as the ability to change channels. The Project Manager suggested that the user interface should be able to choose between different channels, while User Interface suggested a simple remote control with buttons on the left and right sides, and a remote control on the right side. The User Interface team agreed to the idea, but the project manager disagreed, stating that it would be difficult to find the right remote control for the TV remote control. The project manager suggested the idea of having a small remote control in the middle of the table, as it would make it easier for the user to hold it in one hand and not have to hold the remote in their other hand. The industrial designer suggested the use of a small button on the front of the screen to control volume, while user interface suggested using the remote for volume and volume, and marketing suggested the inclusion of a light adaptor to adapt to the user's preference. The Marketing team also suggested the addition of a wireless remote control to the device, which would allow users to control their TV with their hands. The user interface team agreed with the marketing team's idea, as they believed that the remote would be easy to hold and easy to use, and that the design should be simple and user-friendly.",
    "The project manager and Industrial Designer discussed the idea of making a remote control that could be used to control the remote control, with the Industrial Designer saying that it would be easier for people to use it than a traditional remote control. The project manager suggested that the project manager would be the one who would be responsible for deciding on the price, while the Marketing team would be in charge of deciding whether or not to sell the product. The Industrial Designer suggested that they would sell it for less money than a normal remote control and that the marketing team would have the final say on whether to sell it or not. The Marketing team agreed that the product would be more expensive than a regular remote control because of the cost of making it, but they were confident that they could find a way to make it more affordable. Marketing also suggested the idea that the remote could be sold for less than a dollar, with a price tag of less than $20 USD, which would allow them to sell to a wider range of people. The marketing team also suggested that it could be made in a variety of colors, including black, yellow, blue, red, orange, and green. The team also discussed the possibility of making the remote accessible from the side of the remote, as well as incorporating a speaker on the front of the device, which could be placed in the middle of the screen. The industrial designer suggested using a plastic case to hold the remote in one hand and a rubber case on the other, as it would make it easier for the user to hold it in their hands. Marketing suggested using rubber instead of plastic, and the team agreed to this idea, as they believed that rubber was a more durable material than plastic.",
    "Phd f: We have a lot of work to do in terms of getting the information retrieval tool working, but we have a good idea of what we need to do to get it up and running, and I think we'll be able to do it by the end of the year. Phd h: I think it would be a lot easier if we were able to get the data in a format that could be easily accessible to the user, and then we could use it for research purposes. professor b: Yeah, I think that would be the way to go. grad h: Right, which So I've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the ThisL tools are there're two sets, there's a back - end and a front - end, so the front - End is the user interface and the back - ends is the indexing tool and the querying tool.. So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for conveniently you can now do Information retrieval on it, do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting, phd F: What what kind of what does that look like? The string that you type in. So the fact that it took me a day to get It to compile under Solaris means it's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get IT to work, but I think I can get it to work in a day or two.. Phd g: Okay, let's see if we can find a way to make it easier to use it in the future, and we'll see if there's any way to do that.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, said that the Deputy Minister's amendments to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill were designed to address concerns raised by the committee, including the need for a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the change in the law, and to ensure that the public are aware of the implications of the Bill. The Deputy Minister also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the Bill is implemented in a way that is consistent with the Welsh Government's objectives. However, the committee found that while the current Welsh Government was committed to implementing the Bill, future Governments may have less of a commitment. This places further weight on the fact that the Welsh government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the bill beyond its commencement. Furthermore, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness. I think we always need to bear in mind that what the Bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence; it does not create a new offence. And in this context, it doesn't make sense for this Bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished. As I set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point, safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business, and, as now, the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, and I ask Members to reject amendments 1A to 1E because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the legislation.",
    "Kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, we have the design group of Qualifications Wales looking to address some of the issues that arose out of the report around ensuring that, especially from a teacher workload perspective, it's not too onerous in terms of the assessment. I think that added rigour since 2015 has been particularly important in ensuring that there's real value in students undertaking that work. julie morgan am: And what about the effect that the leadership in the school has on the way that the bac is received? Have you\u2014? Kirsty Williams AM: As someone who has had a daughter just finish year 11, that's certainly not the experience that my daughter had in her particular school, and I have another daughter who has just gone into year 10, where the Welsh bac has started in year 10 and it is a two-year course in which elements are undertaken. Obviously, we will need to address, as part of the Design Group and the work that QW Wales is doing, how that is playing out in individual schools. But, we want this to be taken in exactly the same way as we would expect a GCSE to be taught over a period of two years, but recognising that, in some cases, there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised. kirsty Willams am: Yes. I come across individuals for whom their place at university has been secured by that Welsh baccalaureate, and, all of a sudden, if that's what's got you your place, it becomes a lot more valuable than perhaps it was six months before. We need to make sure that students are aware, and teachers and school leaders are aware of the importance that this qualification has. I just want to go back to Julie's question about whether there was a different perspective or a different sense of value for students who are post 16 and those who are pre 16. When one of the college leaders here was asked whether he had people coming to him in his FE college who've been through the pre-16 bac and had heard evidence or had stories of, basically, those children cobbling together their bac in the last four weeks of term before they got there, he said that yes, that is his experience. Does that worry you at all, because, of course, the whole purpose of bac courses is to teach skills over a long period of time, and its purpose cannot be fulfilled by getting it all done in the final term of the last term of year 11 in order to satisfy the curriculum?",
    "Hefin david am: So, what are the challenges that you're facing in terms of implementing these programmes? julie morgan am: Well, there are a number of challenges that we have to deal with, and one of them is that we need to make sure that there are enough resources available to meet the needs of children and parents, and we have a lot of work to do to do that, but it's important that we do it in a way that is cost-effective and cost-efficient, and that's what we're trying to do. hefin david is: And what are some of the challenges you have to address in the early years? jo-anne daniels: I think the biggest challenge is that it's a complex system, and it's complex, and there are lots of challenges to be addressed, but we're taking the right steps to address those challenges. sian gwenllian am: One of the biggest challenges is that there's a lack of funding for early years in Wales, and I think it's going to be a challenge for the Welsh Government to find the money to pay for it, but I think they're doing a good job, and they're working on it, and hopefully they'll be able to find a way forward in the next couple of years.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker into the remote control, with the idea of having a speaker in the case, but they were unable to come up with a suitable material for it. Marketing suggested using wood, but the industrial designer pointed out that it would be expensive and difficult to manufacture, and they would have to find a way to incorporate it into the case. The team decided to go with wood, as it was the most cost-effective material, as well as the only material that could withstand the heat of the power supply. Marketing also suggested using a plastic case, which was deemed too expensive, and the team agreed that a rubber case would be too expensive. The industrial designer suggested that the case could be made out of rubber, which would be more durable than plastic, and that it could be used for a variety of purposes, such as for decoration or for decoration. However, the team decided against using rubber as a material for the case due to the cost and difficulty of manufacturing it. They also decided to use wood for the buttons, as they believed that it was a better material than plastic and would be easier to manufacture. Marketing expressed interest in using wood as the material, but it would require a lot of time and money to produce it. The group also discussed the feasibility of incorporating the remote into a case, as the plastic case was too expensive and could be difficult to produce. They decided to focus on making the case out of wood, which they found to be a more durable material, and it was also cheaper and easier to produce than plastic.",
    "Phd c: Yeah, I think it would be interesting to see if we can find a way to reduce the amount of time it takes for the signal to travel through the channel, or if it's possible to reduce it. professor a: I think we can do that, but I don't think it's practical to do that right now because there are a lot of things going on in the system and we don't know what they're going to do with them. phd d: We'll have to wait and see, but we'll see what happens.. And the third point was the, yeah, the on - line normalization where, well, the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor A: Yeah. And I think that's a good idea because it would allow us to get a better understanding of what's going on with the signal and what's happening to the signal, and we can use that information to improve the quality of the signal. professor c: Okay, so we're gonna try to find out what the problem is and then we'll come up with a solution to it. We'll see how it goes and see if there's any way to address it, but it seems like there's a lot to be done.",
    "The group discussed the design of the remote control, with the project manager stating that it would be difficult to create a universal remote control that could be used by everyone, as it would require a lot of time and money, while the industrial designer suggested that the user interface should be able to control the remote with just one button. User Interface suggested the idea of a simple remote control with only one button, but the team agreed that it was not practical to include a second button. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition function into the remote, which would allow users to activate the remote by pressing a button on the back of the device. The industrial designer proposed that the remote could be programmed to recognize the user's voice, and the user could control the device by pressing the power button on a remote control. The project manager agreed to this idea, as long as it could be implemented in a way that would be easy to use and easy to understand. The user interface proposed a simple design, with buttons on the front and back, and a single button for the volume and volume control, as well as a power button and a volume button for volume control. However, the team decided to focus on making the remote more user-friendly, as they did not want to make it too complicated. They also decided to use a simple and simple design with a simple button, with only a few buttons for volume, volume, and volume, as opposed to a complex design with multiple buttons. The group also agreed on the need for a more advanced design, which included the addition of a speaker, a microphone, a speaker speaker, and an LED light, and they also agreed to incorporate a microphone for voice recognition. The remote control should have a speaker and microphone, and it should be powered by a rechargeable battery, which could be connected to a power supply. The power button should be located on the right side of the screen, and there should be a button that can be pressed to turn on and off the power supply, and another button to turn off the battery. The device should also have a volume control button, which can be placed on the left or right sides of the display, and beep when it's turned on or off.",
    "The group discussed the impact of COVID-19 on children and young people in Wales, with Vaughan Gething expressing concern about the possibility of a rise in the number of deaths due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the impact on the longer-term health of those affected by the virus. Heaney emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of children and their carers, and the need to ensure that they receive the necessary care. He also highlighted the need for the government to ensure the health and safety of the wider community, with a focus on the well-being of the elderly and children. The Minister for Health and Social Services agreed with the Minister for Education and the Chief Nursing Officer that it was important for the public to be aware of the potential impact of the pandemic on young people and their families.

    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we need to be mindful of the challenges that we face, and I think that we have to make sure that we are doing everything we can to ensure that we meet those challenges. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), and I am confident that we will be able to address those challenges in the new legislation. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. I think what's really important to me is the success of universities, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty Williams AM: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's very important, and that is something that I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. So, we've been keen to put students at the front of things to ensure the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen, or whether there is more that we'll need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those objectives are still very, very relevant, but we'll have to recognise the importance of having legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. However, there is a need for a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good, but to the public good. But, Huw, do you know if there is anything else to add? huw morris: Yes, just to say that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. So the scale here is small, and the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association.",

Marketing: Okay, I'm sure that they will like it, I just hope that it's not too expensive. Industrial Designer: I don't think it will cost a lot of money to make this remote control, it's just going to look like a normal remote control and it won't have any buttons or anything like that, but it will have some buttons on it, so people can use it to turn it on and off, and it can be used as a remote control for other things. Marketing's idea is to make it look like an old-fashioned remote control with buttons, and the industrial designer thinks that it would be a good idea to have a small button on the front, so that people don't have to look for it.",

Kirsty williams am: Yes, I think that there is a need for the PDG to be used to support more able-and-talented children, but we have to be careful not to lose sight of the fact that there are more able and talented children who need to be supported, and it is important to ensure that they receive the support they need. We need to ensure they are not only supported, but that they are supported in the right way, and that they have the support that they need to meet their needs. So, it's very important that we have a good understanding of the impact of PDG on these children, and I'm sure that we will continue to work closely with the education directorate and other stakeholders to identify the best way forward. llilyr, are you confident that the government will be able to address the issue of how to implement PDG effectively in Wales? Kirsty Williams AM: Absolutely. I think the government is aware of the challenges that we face, and they are working hard to address those challenges, but they are also working closely with other stakeholders, including schools, to address them.

User Interface: I think it's a good idea to have a simple and easy-to-use remote control with a lot of buttons, and I think that it will be easier for the user to use it. Industrial designer: I agree with the idea, but I don't think we should have too many buttons on the remote, because it would make it too difficult for people to find the remote. The project manager suggested that the user interface should be able to change the shape of the remote to match their personal preference, and that it should not be too complicated. The user interface team agreed that the design should be based on the user's personal preferences, with the exception of the power button, which would have to be placed on the back of the device. The industrial designer proposed that the remote should have a button on the left side of the screen, which could be programmed to turn on and off by pressing a button, while the user could control the remote with the right hand.

The user interface team agreed with this idea, with the user interface designer stating that a banana shaped case would be a good choice for the product, as it could be easily held in the hand and easily accessible. The industrial designer proposed that the product should be able to change color and shape depending on the user's preference, and that the design should be flexible enough to adapt to different shapes and sizes of the device. The team agreed on the need for a simple design with a simple and easy-to-use look and feel, as well as an easy to use design that would be comfortable for the user.

Irwin Cotler, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, Senator Salma Ataullahjan and I have all proposed bills on this. This is another bill that would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. I'm sure petitioners would want me to add that, given the urgency of this issue, perhaps the government could consider bringing forward a government bill on this issue which would allow the process to move much faster.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of using a single-curved design for the remote control, with the idea of using the same shape as in the cell phone, but with a different shape for the buttons, as well as the possibility to use the same design for all the buttons. The team also discussed the feasibility of incorporating a battery into the remote, as it would reduce the cost of the product, and the team agreed to incorporate a power button on the front of the remote. The industrial designer suggested using a battery to power the device, but the project manager disagreed, stating that it would be too expensive, as the battery would have to be placed in a separate case. The project manager agreed with the industrial designer that the battery should be placed on the back of the device and the user interface agreed with this idea, as they believed that the device should be easily accessible and easy to use. They also agreed that the design should be simple, with a simple design, and that it should not be too complicated, as there would be no need for a complicated circuit board. However, the team realized that they would not be able to achieve the desired result, and they decided to focus on a simpler design that would be more user-friendly and less complicated. User Interface: I think it's a good idea to have a simple remote control with only one button, and I think that it will be easier for the user to use it. Industrial Designer: I agree with you, but I don't think we should have too many buttons, because it's not practical to have more than one button. The idea of having a single button would be appealing to the user, but it would cost too much money, and it would make it difficult for the team to produce enough units to meet the demand. The user interface suggested that the remote should be shaped like the shape of a coin, with buttons on the left and right sides of the screen, and could be used to turn on and off the TV, or it could be shaped to be used as a remote control for different functions. The group agreed that it was important for the design to be simple and not too complicated.",
    "The met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market, because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So we need to combine those ones industrial designer: user interface: and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. user Interface: It's you program it like you say, record, and then, play, and then, record, play machine, and stuff like that, so that's And it's much Yeah. marketing: So user interface, the raised symbols I thought were good, the L_C_D_, it does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the industrial designer's help with the design of the remote control? User Interface: I don't think it would be too expensive, I think we'll be able to meet our budget. Industrial designer: I think it's going to cost a lot of money to make this remote control, but we're going to do it anyway, because it's important to us. Marketing: I agree with you, but I have to ask you one question: What are the reasons behind the lack of color on these remote controls, and why are they not more colorful than the ones we have now. User Interface, Industrial Designer, Project Manager, and User Interface have been working on a new remote control for the past few months, with the aim of raising the quality of the product.",
    "The project manager and the industrial designer agreed on the need for a new remote control with a unique design, and the user interface agreed to make the remote control more user-friendly, as it would be easier to use than the current remote control. The team also agreed that the design of the remote should be based on the user's preferences, with the aim of making it easy to use and comfortable for the user. The industrial designer proposed the idea of a remote control that could be used to control the television, but the idea was rejected by the project manager, who believed that it would not be practical. The project manager agreed, however, and suggested that the idea should be incorporated into the product in the form of a simple and easy-to-use remote control, which would be easily accessible and easy to understand. User Interface agreed with the idea, as they believed that a simple remote control would make it easier for people to use the remote, and they would be able to use it more easily. The user interface proposed a simple design, with a single button on the right side of the device, which could be programmed to turn on and off by pressing the power button, but it would require the user to hold the remote in their hand for a few seconds to activate it. The remote control should be easy to control, and it should not be too difficult to use, as long as it is not too heavy or bulky. The idea was to create a device with a simple look and feel, with buttons on the left and right sides of the screen, and a button for the power and volume buttons, as well as a power button for volume and volume control. However, the team realized that it was not practical to include a remote button in the product, as the buttons would be too heavy and bulky, and there would be a risk of damage to the device if the buttons were placed too close together. The group decided to focus on a simple, simple design that would be easy for users to hold and use, with only one button on each side, and to minimize the cost of the product.",
    "Kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we need to ensure that we have a system in place to address those challenges, and that's why we've been working closely with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I think they have a very positive working relationship with the Welsh Government. We have a strong relationship with them, and it is important that we continue to work closely with them in the future. sian gwenllian am: I think that's a very important aspect of the debate, because we have to make sure that the sector is well-regulated and well-resourced, and there's a need for the sector to be able to meet the needs of their students. Kirsty Williams am: It's important for us to recognise the challenges that we face in the sector and the challenges they face, but it's also important to recognize that there is a lot to be done to ensure the safety and stability of the sector. We need to be mindful of these challenges, but we also need to look at how to address them in a way that is beneficial to the sector as a whole. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more to do to achieve those four objectives, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on. But, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh government, so I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at least at the moment, we'll be looking at the possibility of introducing a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good.",

    "The team discussed the possibility of using speech recognition and gesture recognition for the remote control, with the user interface designer suggesting using a speech recognition interface, while the industrial designer suggested using a voice recognition interface and the project manager suggested using gesture recognition. The project manager agreed with the User Interface Designer and User Interface User Interface, and the Industrial Designer suggested using voice recognition, as it would be easier for the user to understand what they want to do. The Industrial Designer also suggested the use of speech recognition, but the Project Manager was skeptical about this idea, as he believed that it would not be practical for a remote control to be used in the future. The User Interface team agreed, as they felt that it was not practical to incorporate speech recognition into the remote controls, but they did not want to compromise on the functionality. The Project Manager agreed with User Interface Industrial Designer User Interface and Industrial Designer Industrial Designer, and they agreed on the need for a more advanced remote control that would be easy to use and easy to understand. The team decided to use a speech-recognition feature, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice or gesture recognition, and would allow them to change channels without having to hold the remote in their hands. The user interface team proposed the idea of a voice-activated remote control with voice recognition technology, which was agreed upon by the team. However, the team debated the feasibility of using the remote controller as a speech synthesizer, considering the cost of the device, as well as the difficulty of implementing it in a small remote control. User Interface suggested using the speech recognition feature, while Industrial Designer proposed using a gesture recognition system, which the team agreed to.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM: I'm pleased to welcome the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, Karen Cornish, Deputy Director, Children and Families Division at Welsh Government, and Emma Gammon, lawyer for Welsh Government. As I said, the purpose of the meeting is to undertake Stage 2 proceedings on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, and to consider amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the duty to raise awareness. We don't think, actually, that this adds anything to the Government amendment, which already mentions awareness. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive, well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change, and understand how to respond to it. The witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands the implications of the changes to the law made by section 1. I tabled these amendments in response to this committee's recommendation\u2014this was a recommendation from this committee in the Stage 1 report, so I have responded to that. An important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that I've tabled within this group\u2014that of a sustained awareness campaign, which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the Bill, but serves as a duty for future administrations. Additionally, the committee found that while the current Welsh Government's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt, future Governments may have less of a commitment. This places further weight on the fact that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote awareness beyond its commencement. Furthermore, the children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill quite clearly notes that, under section 2, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment. I think we always need to bear in mind that what the Bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence; it does not create a new offence. And in this context, it doesn't make sense for this Bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished. Finally, provide an overview of the political background and the aim of the group.",
    "The team discussed the design of the remote control, with the user interface designer suggesting that it should be simple and easy to use, while the project manager agreed that it would not be too difficult to create a simple remote control. The project manager suggested the idea of a remote control that could be placed in the user's hand, as it would be easier for the user to control the remote. The user interface suggested that the remote should be able to change the channel, and the team agreed that the design should be user-friendly. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition system into the remote, which would allow users to ask for the channel by pressing a button on the remote or by selecting a channel from a list of channels. However, the team realized that this would require a lot of time and effort, and they decided to focus on a simple design instead. The group agreed on the need for a new remote control with a simple look and feel, as well as an easy-to-use design that would be easy to change. The industrial designer proposed a simple and simple design, with buttons for different channels, buttons for the channels, and buttons for channels and channels. The remote control could be programmed by the user, and it could also be programmed to change channels, allowing users to choose the channel they want, or it could be used as a search function, allowing them to find the channel of their choice. The idea of using the remote to search for a specific channel was also discussed, but the team decided against this idea, as they believed that it was too complicated and would require too much effort. The marketing team suggested the addition of a speech recognition system, which was agreed upon by the industrial designer and user interface user interface, who agreed that this was a good idea. They also agreed to incorporate a speech-recognition function into the design, as long as it was not too complicated.",
    "The team discussed the idea of having a different color for the buttons, with the industrial designer saying that they would like to use a different colour for the red apple, while the marketing team suggested using a different material for the blue apple, and the project manager agreed, saying that it would be a good idea to have a special colour. The team also discussed the possibility of adding a speaker to the front of the remote, which would be used for voice recognition, as well as a speaker for the microphone, but the team decided against it, as they were concerned about the cost of the microphone. Marketing suggested that the microphone could be placed on the back of the device, as it would make it easier for people to find the remote. Marketing also suggested that it could be used as a remote control, as long as it didn't cost more than a few Euros. However, the team agreed that the price would have to be lower than the price of a normal remote, and they would need to find a way to make it more affordable. The project manager suggested that they could make the buttons in a variety of colors, including red, orange, blue, and yellow, and that the buttons could be made of different materials, including rubber, wood, titanium, and titanium. The marketing team also suggested the inclusion of a special button for the Apple logo, which was considered by the team to be the most important part of the product. The industrial designer agreed to this idea, as he felt that the logo would be visually appealing, and he was confident that the team would be able to incorporate the logo into the design. The group agreed to the idea, but they were not sure if they would have enough money to pay for it. Marketing was concerned about how much it would cost to produce the prototype, as there was no way to estimate the cost, and it was unclear whether they could afford it.",
    "dafydd evans: I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. nick brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bach\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within those professional sectors, I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh baac initially, but the Welsh Baac has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy. In terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would be true of the lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but nevertheless, for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh Baccalaureate. sian gwenllian am: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the British bac?",
    "The group discussed the possibility of incorporating a teletext button into the remote control, but the industrial designer suggested that it would be too expensive, and the project manager agreed that it was too expensive for a remote control that could be used only for television. User Interface suggested the idea of having a button on the back of the remote, which could be placed on the front of the device, but they were unable to find a way to incorporate it into the design of the product. The project manager suggested that the user interface should be able to control the remote with the help of a button, and that it should be easy to use and easy to understand. The team agreed that the remote should be simple to use, as it should not be too complicated, and it should only be used once, with the exception of the power button, which should be placed in the center of the screen. The user interface suggested the use of a light-up and blue light, which would make it easier for the user to find the remote. The industrial designer proposed that the light should be emitted from the remote to the user, and user interface agreed, as long as it did not interfere with the television. The group agreed on the need for a simple and easy-to-use remote control with a simple design, as well as a more complex design with a lot of buttons, and they agreed to include a button for the power and volume buttons. The idea of using a light to turn on and off the television was discussed, but it was decided that the device should not have any buttons on it, as there was no way to control it with a button. The remote control should be easily accessible, and users would not have to hold it in their hands, as they could simply hold it with their hands. The Industrial Designer suggested that a button should be located on the left-hand side of the display, while the User Interface proposed a button in the right-hand corner. The Project Manager agreed with this idea, and suggested the inclusion of buttons on the right side for the volume and volume control. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer on the importance of a user-friendly design, and agreed to incorporate a simple button for volume control and a power button for power control.",
    "The team discussed the idea of a universal remote control, with the user interface team deciding to focus on a simple and simple design, while the marketing team suggested a more complex remote control that would be more complex, and the industrial designer suggested using an LCD screen for the remote control. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating an LCD display into the remote, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost and complexity of the project manager's concerns about the cost, as well as the cost of the LCD display. The marketing team also suggested that the remote should not be too complicated, as it would be easier for people to use than an LCD remote, and that it should be easy to use and easy to understand. The project manager agreed with the team that the design should be user-friendly and simple, and they also agreed that it was important to have a simple design that would appeal to a wide range of people. The industrial designer also suggested the use of buttons on the front of the remote to make it easier to use, but the team decided against this idea because they believed that it would make the remote too complicated. The idea of having a remote control with a screen was also rejected by the team, as they felt that it wouldn't be aesthetically pleasing and would be too hard to use. They also believed that a simple remote control would be the best way to control the remote because it would allow people to control their TV without having to hold it in their hands, and it would also be easy for them to find the remote easily. The group also decided that they would like to incorporate a remote with buttons on it, but they were not sure if they would be able to find them, as there was a lack of information about what they needed to do.

Industrial Designer: Yes, that's what I like about this idea, it could be used to cook or for other purposes. Project Manager: Okay, so we're going to start with the functional design and then we'll move on to the marketing and then the industrial designer.

    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker into the remote control, with the idea of having a speaker in the case, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the material. Marketing: Industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to use wood, as it's more durable than plastic, and it's easier to handle. User Interface: Yeah, I agree with that idea, but I think we need to make sure that it's not too hard to handle, and that it doesn't get in the way of the user's fingers. marketing: Industrial Designer: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether or not we want to use plastic or wood, and then we'll have to make a decision on the shape of the case and the material, but we're not sure if we should go with rubber or wood. User interface: I'm not sure about the shape, but the idea is to have a rounded shape, and I think that would be the best shape for the size of the remote, and the shape would be more ergonomic than the flat shape. Marketing, Industrial Designer, User Interface, and User Interface agree on the need for a flat shape, as they both agree that it would make it easier for people to hold it in their hands, and they would be able to use it to hold the remote in their hand. They also agree that they would like to incorporate a speaker and microphone into the device, as well as a speaker for the microphone, and a microphone for the voice recognition. Marketing believes that the microphone should be placed on the back of the device to make it easy to find and easy to use. Marketing also believes that it is important for the user to have the ability to control the remote with their voice, as long as they don't accidentally press the button. Marketing suggests that the remote should be made of plastic, but User Interface suggests using wood as the material because it's cheaper and easier to manufacture.",

The user interface suggested that there should be a button on the right side of the screen that could be used to turn on and off the TV, and that it could also be used as a button to turn off the television. The industrial designer suggested that a simple button would be the best option, as this would allow users to easily switch between channels without having to hold on to the remote for too long. However, the team agreed that there was no need for this, as there was only one remote control in the market, and there were only a handful of people who would be willing to pay for it. User Interface: I think it's a good idea to use a small remote control because it's easy to hold and it has a lot of features, and I think that it will be easier for people to use.

    "The petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation, which would allow people to choose not to participate in organ donation. They also call on the government to create a national network of doctors and hospitals to ensure that all Canadians have access to quality and safe care. They are calling for the Government to establish a national registry of organ donors, and for the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to ensure the safety of all Canadians. The petitioners also call for the establishment of a government-funded program to provide support to those affected by the pandemic. They urge the Prime Minister to prioritize the implementation of this program, as well as other measures to address the issue. They call for a review of the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and they call on it to take immediate and effective action to protect the health and safety of Canadians, especially those who are vulnerable to the virus. They further call on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to support a bill that would ban military-style assault weapons from entering the country and to ban handguns from entering Canada. They have also called on the Parliament to enact legislation to ban the sale of handguns in all provinces and territories, and to implement a national ban on handguns in provinces that do not currently have a handgun registry. They ask for the introduction of legislation that would prohibit the possession of handguns by anyone under the age of 18. The Prime Minister is also expected to address this issue in the House of Commons in the coming weeks. The Parliament is expected to pass a bill in the near future that will ban all handguns in the country. The government is also considering a bill to ban all firearms from entering into the country, including handguns, except for those used for defence and defence-related purposes.",
    "User Interface: I think it would be a good idea to have a remote control with a lot of buttons on it, and I think that it would make it easier for people to find their remote control, but I don't know if they would be able to find it in the dark, or if they'd have to hold it in their hands. Industrial designer: It would be nice to have the ability to control the remote control by pressing a button on the remote, but we can't afford to do that, because it would cost too much money. User Interface: But I think we can make it more affordable, because we have a lot more money in our budget, and we can afford to spend more money on the product. Industrial Designer: I agree with the user interface, but the cost of the product is too high, so we need to find a way to make it cheaper. Marketing: We have to think about the price of the device, but it's not too expensive for us to produce it. We need to make sure that the price is not too high because we want to keep costs down, but if it's too expensive, we'll have to change the design of the remote. The project manager and the industrial designer agreed that the cost would be too high for them to produce the product, but they were confident that they could make it cost-effective. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should have a light on the front, and the project manager agreed. The user interface suggested the idea of using a light to turn on and off the lights, and it was decided that the light would be placed in the middle of the screen, with the buttons on the left and right sides, and on the right and left sides. The remote control should also have a power button, as well as a volume button and a volume control, as it is easier for the user to control it. The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a teletext function into the remote as well, but ultimately decided against it, as they felt that it was too expensive and would not be practical.",
    "The team discussed the need for a new remote control, with User Interface suggesting a simple and simple design that would be easy to use and easy to understand, while the Project Manager agreed that it would be important for the user to be able to control the remote with their hands. The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be simple, simple, and simple, while User Interface emphasized the importance of having a simple design, with a simple look and feel. The team agreed that the design should not be too complicated, with the exception of the buttons, as they would need to be easily recognisable, and the user interface suggested that it should be easy for users to find the right buttons. The project manager agreed with the User Interface regarding the design of the remote, stating that it was important to keep the design simple, as it would make it easier to understand and easier to use. However, the Industrial Designer expressed concerns about the cost of the product, as the project manager emphasized the need to incorporate more advanced features into the design, such as the ability to change the channel, as well as the possibility of incorporating more functions into the remote. The User Interface team agreed to incorporate these features in the next meeting, but the team was unable to agree on how to incorporate them into the final design due to a lack of time and resources. The Project Manager suggested the idea of incorporating a remote control with a small screen, which was met with skepticism by User Interface, who believed that the screen would be too small and too hard to use, but they were unable to come to a consensus on the issue. User Interface agreed with this assessment, and it was decided that the team would focus on a simple remote control that could be easily understood by the user, which would be simple and easy for them to understand.",

The team also discussed the need for the remote to be user-friendly, as well as the need to make it easy for users to find the remote, as it was difficult to find it in the dark. The group agreed that the design of the device should be based on the user's preferences, with a simple design and a simple look and feel. The Industrial Designer emphasized that the remote should be simple to use, and that it shouldn't be too complicated, as there should be no buttons on the remote except for the power button and the channel button, and it should be easy to find. The marketing team agreed with the User Interface team that there was a need for a simple and easy-to-use remote control with buttons that could be easily accessible, and they also agreed that a simple remote control would be easier to use than a complicated remote control. The Marketing team also agreed with User Interface that the user interface should be intuitive and simple, and suggested that it should have a simple layout, with buttons for volume, volume, channel, and power, and buttons for channel and channel. The User Interface group agreed with Marketing regarding the idea of having a simple button for volume and channel, but they were concerned about the cost of the product, as they believed that the price would be too high. Marketing also suggested that the product should be more affordable, as the cost would be less than the price of a traditional remote control and it could be used in a more affordable way. The user interface team agreed to the idea, as long as the price wasn't too high, and Marketing agreed to make the product more affordable than a standard remote control because they wanted to avoid having to pay more money for it.",
    "The team discussed the need for a new design for the remote control, with the project manager suggesting that it should have a unique look and feel, and the marketing team agreed that it would be a good idea to incorporate the logo into the design of the product. The team also discussed the importance of having a unique design, as well as the need to find a way to incorporate it into the overall design. The project manager suggested that the design should be simple and simple, with a simple shape and minimalistic design, and that the buttons should be easy to find and easy to hold. The marketing team also agreed that the remote should not be too bulky, as it could be easily lost, and it should be able to be used in a variety of ways, including a stand-by function. The industrial designer suggested that it might be possible to create a remote control that could be used to control the TV, but it would have to be simple in terms of size and shape, and there would need to be no buttons on the front or back of the remote, as they would be difficult to find. The idea of having the remote in the shape of an apple was also considered, but the team decided against it because they felt that it was unnecessary, and they didn't want to make it too bulky. They also wanted to avoid having too many buttons on it, but they were concerned about the cost and the cost of having to pay for it. Marketing: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether or not we want to go with a battery-powered remote control or not, and then we'll decide on the size of the battery and the shape. marketing: I think it's safe to assume that it's going to be a battery powered remote, but we're not sure if it's gonna be battery powered or not. Industrial designer: I'm not sure about that, but I'm sure it won't be too big, and I think that it'll be a lot more comfortable to hold than a regular remote control.. marketing: Okay so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general, consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that the br t television remote control, a fancy look and feeling, okay, and not, it specified, not a functional look or or feel, but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons. There's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand by and s the other examples of that The other examples for the other buttons are the green colour button and the blue colour button, but there's a lot of people who want to use the red color button, so I think we should go with the green color button.. one of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them, project manager: user interface: So the up volume button looks like it should probably be a down volume, but since it's not a button, it shouldn't look like it has a V on it. industrial designer: It would be interesting to see if we can find a solution to this problem, and we'll talk about it at the end of the meeting.",
    "user interface: so in the different stages of the design, including the decision on changeable cases, and any discussion about changes in the current design.and I like to show you the agenda for the meeting, I don't know if it was sent round to all of you. project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way, so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product.. marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures. industrial designer: I think i in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be trendy, user friendly and original so I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned, that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this.",
    "Kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we need to ensure that we have a system in place to address those challenges, and that's why we've been working closely with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I think they have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I think that they're doing a fantastic job, and they're working hard to make sure that the sector is well-regulated and well-resourced, and it is important for the sector to be able to meet the needs of their students. sian gwenllian am: I think there's a lot to be said about the importance of the remit letter, because it's a very important part of the legislation, but it's also important to note that it's not the only piece of legislation that has to be updated, as there are other parts of the Bill that have to be amended, such as the post-compulsory education and training Bill. Kirsty Williams AM, and Huw Morris AM, Director of the Skills, Higher Education and Lifelong Learning Group in Welsh Government, agreed that the Bill should be amended to incorporate the new legislation into the existing legislation. They also highlighted the need for the Bill to address the challenges faced by the sector in terms of funding and regulation, as well as the need to improve the quality of the education system in Wales.",
    "The team discussed the design of the remote control, with the user interface suggesting a simple design with a simple and easy-to-use design, while the industrial designer suggested a more complex design with multiple buttons, and the project manager suggested incorporating a power button and a volume button, as well as a remote control that could be used to turn on and off the television. The industrial designer proposed the idea of a two-sided remote control with two buttons on the left and right sides, while user interface suggested using a single button on the right side of the device to control the remote. The project manager agreed with the idea, but suggested that it would be more difficult to incorporate the power button into the remote, as it would require a separate circuit board, which would be difficult to manufacture. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a battery, but the idea was rejected, as the battery would require too much energy, and it would not be practical for the cost of the product. The user interface proposed the use of an infrared light, which could be turned on or off by pressing a button, but they were unable to find a way to incorporate it into the product due to the cost and complexity of the circuit board. The group discussed the feasibility of incorporating the power and volume buttons into a single remote control and decided to focus on the latter, as they believed that it was the most cost-effective way to achieve the desired result. User Interface suggested the inclusion of a simple button, while Industrial Designer suggested the addition of a volume and volume button on either side, and User Interface proposed the incorporation of a voice button on both sides, which was agreed upon by the team. The Industrial Designer proposed a simple, simple design, with only one button on each side, but User Interface emphasized the importance of having two buttons, as there were too many buttons to fit in the device. The Project Manager agreed with User Interface's suggestion, as he believed that a simple remote control would be easier to use than a multi-function remote control.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, and Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government, presented their views on the amendments to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. They highlighted the need for a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the change in the law, as well as the need to ensure that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. They also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the Bill is implemented in a way that respects the rights of children. The Deputy Minister expressed concern about the lack of clarity in the Bill, as it was unclear whether the public would be able to understand the implications of the law change. However, the Deputy Minister emphasized that it was not necessary for the public to understand all of the details of the bill, as they would only need to know what they needed to know.",
    "Angela burns am: I want to ask about the impact of Brexit on Welsh universities, as we have seen a rise in the cost of tuition fees in the past year, and I would like to know what the impact will be on the sector in the coming years. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that there are challenges for the sector, but we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost. But that's not the same as falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector; it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, the challenges are quite acute, and the challenges have to be managed, but the challenge is quite acute. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than they would be in the English system. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to reflect a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs. And so, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that. and those will be significant costs that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge. And I'm just talking about one, but there are also differences in the way universities have secured funding for investing in their estates, so, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending, so they have a bond, whereas Cardiff University has a significant amount of cash, and those funds will be used to invest in their estate.",
    "Kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we have to recognise the challenges that we face, and I think that we need to be mindful of that. We have to make sure that we are doing everything we can to address those challenges, but we also need to ensure that we have the support of the Welsh Government and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, so that we can meet the needs of the sector. I think we have a very positive working relationship with the HEFCW, and there is a lot to be gained from working with them, and it is important that we continue to work closely with them. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more to be done to achieve those four objectives, because I think those objectives are still very, very relevant, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on. We need to look at how we can incorporate those experiences into the new legislation, and that's one of the things that we'll look to take forward in the new Bill. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, or that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation? Kirsty Willams Am: I think the remit letters are a very important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the higher education funding bodies, and then HEFCWs use their powers to ensure they meet those priorities. So, certainly, I see this as being a really important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated and then change happens. But, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh government, so the scale here is small. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students, so, we've been keen to put students at the front of things to make Sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. We'll certainly be looking to see whether we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but I think what's really important to me is the success of these institutions.",
    "The team discussed the remote control's functionality, with the User Interface Designer suggesting that it should be able to recognize the user's voice and gesture recognition, while the Project Manager agreed that it would be a good idea to have a voice recognition feature, as it would make it easier for the user to switch between channels. The team also discussed the possibility of using speech recognition, as the project manager believed that the user would be more likely to use it if it was easier for them to understand what they wanted to do. The User Interface designer proposed the idea of a remote control that could be programmed to change channels, and the team agreed to incorporate it into the design of the product. However, the team realized that they would need to create a new remote control, as they did not want to spend money on a separate remote control for each remote control. The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote controller could be used as a stand-alone unit, and that it could be placed on a table or in the center of the room. The project manager agreed, as long as it was not too expensive. The Project Manager also suggested the use of a speech recognition system, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice or gesture recognition. User Interface User Interface: Yeah, I think it's a very interesting idea, but we have to be careful not to overcomplicate it. Industrial Designer: I don't know if it's possible, but I think we can do it. Marketing: Okay, let's see what we can come up with. Industrial designer: We have to find a way to make it easy for people to understand it, but it's going to cost a lot of money, but they can easily adjust the price of the remote if they want to buy a new one. The user interface designer suggested that they could use the remote as a remote, but the team had to decide whether to use a voice-recognition system or a gesture-based system. The industrial designer suggested using a speech-to-text recognition system to identify the user, while User Interface suggested using gesture recognition for the voice recognition.",

The user interface also expressed concerns about the cost of the product, as it would require a lot of time and money to produce, as well as having to deal with a large amount of buttons. However, the team agreed that they were willing to pay extra for the cost, as they were confident that the product would be affordable. The industrial designer also expressed concern about the price of the device, as he believed that the price would be too high for a remote control of this size and complexity. User Interface: I think it would cost a lot, but I think we can afford it, as long as it doesn't cost too much. Industrial Designer: I agree with you, I think the price is too high, but it's not too expensive for us to have to pay for it.",
    "The group discussed the feasibility of using CD's for backup and the importance of having a computer that can be easily accessed. The group agreed that it would be a good idea to use a CD as a backup, as it would reduce the chances of losing data if the computer were to be lost or damaged.",
    "The Project Manager explained that the remote control should be able to control a variety of devices, such as a television, a computer, a phone, a television remote control, a game controller, and a gaming controller, as well as a gaming mouse and keyboard.

However, the Project Manager expressed concerns about the cost of the remote, stating that the cost would be too high, and suggested that it should be more affordable. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer regarding the cost, as they believed that the price should be less than twelve Euros, and that the design should be based on the user's preference. The Industrial Designer also suggested the inclusion of a button on the right-hand side, which would allow users to control the remote by pressing the button, while the user would have to hold it in their hand to activate it. The team also discussed the possibility of using the remote as a remote control for other devices, with the User Interface designer suggesting that it could be used to control multiple devices at once. The project manager agreed with this idea, but suggested that there should be a separate button for the left-handed user and a right-handed one for the right, as there was no need for two buttons on the same remote. The user interface team agreed to this suggestion, but the Industrial Design team disagreed with the idea, believing that the buttons should be placed on the left side of the device, as this would make it easier for users to use the remote.

The industrial designer also suggested the use of a special material for the buttons, which was deemed too expensive for the budget, but it could still be used in the future. The marketing team also suggested using the same material as the body of the device, but instead of using a plastic case, they opted for a rubber material, which they felt was more durable and less expensive. However, the industrial designer expressed concerns about the cost of the material, as it was difficult to find a material that was strong enough to withstand the heat of the sun, so they opted to go with a rubber case instead. They also considered using a different material, but ultimately decided against it, as they believed that the rubber material would be too expensive.",

The user interface suggested that the microphone should be placed on the front of the device, as this would be easier for the user to reach and easier to reach. The marketing team agreed with this idea and agreed to include the microphone in the front, but they did not agree on the size of the microphone. The Marketing Manager suggested placing it on the back of the controller, as there was no room for it in the original design. The industrial designer agreed to this idea, as he believed that the cost would be less than the cost of the speaker, and that the speaker would be easy to find and easy to use. The team agreed to incorporate the microphone into the remote as a part of the design, although they were not sure about the cost. They also discussed the possibility of adding a speaker to the remote to improve the quality of the voice recognition system, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost and complexity of the system.

They also agreed that it was important to have a remote control that could be easily accessible, as they would be able to control the remote without having to hold it in their hand. The project manager suggested the idea of having a small remote control, which could be placed in the user's hand and easily accessible. However, the idea was rejected by the user interface team due to the cost and complexity of the remote, and the team decided to focus on a simple remote control with a simple design. The industrial designer suggested that the design should be based on the design of the T_V_ remote control itself, and that it should not be too complicated. The team also discussed the feasibility of incorporating a new type of remote control into the device, as the current remote control was too complicated, with a lot of buttons, buttons, and buttons. The group agreed that a new remote control would be more user-friendly, and they decided to design a simple and easy-to-use remote that would be simple to use. They decided to include a small button on the remote to control it, as well as a button for selecting the channel and a button to select the channel. The remote control could be programmed with different channels, with the user having the option to choose from a list of channels or to choose between different channels.",
    "The group discussed the design of the remote control, with the user interface stating that they would like to keep it simple and simple, and the project manager stating that it would be easier for the user to use it than a traditional remote control. They also discussed the importance of having a simple design, as well as the need for a simple and easy-to-use remote control that would be easy to use and easy to understand. The project manager also mentioned that the team would need to come up with a new design for the remote, as they were not sure if they would be able to find a way to incorporate all of the necessary components into a single remote control or whether they would have to add more functions to it. The team decided to focus on creating a simple remote control with a simple look and feel, as it was easier to use than a more complicated remote control due to the lack of buttons. User Interface: I think it's a good idea to have a small button on the right side of the screen, so that the user doesn't have to hold on to it for too long. Industrial Designer: I agree with this idea, but I think that it might be a little too much work for a remote control of this size and weight, so I think we should go for a smaller size. Industrial designer: Okay, I agree, but we need to make sure that we don't add too much complexity to the design because we want to keep the design simple. The main focus of this meeting will be on the design, and it will be important for the team to make the design as simple as possible. The user interface will be the lead designer, while the industrial designer and project manager will be responsible for the marketing and user interface, respectively.",
    "User Interface: Okay, so we're going to start with the remote control, we need to find a way to make it easier for the user to control the remote, and we're not sure how to do it, but we have a few ideas on how to achieve that. Industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to have a button on the right side of the remote to control it, and I think that it would make it easy for people to find it easily. User Interface: We need to make sure that it's easy to use and easy to understand, and that it doesn't get in the way of the user's hands. Industrial Designer: I agree with User Interface, but I don't think it's necessary to include a lot of buttons, because the buttons are already there, and it's not necessary to add more buttons, but it's still important to be able to find them easily. Project Manager: We'll have to find the right buttons, and then we'll decide whether or not to include them in the design, but if they're not, we'll just have to change them later on. user Interface: I'm not sure if I want to change the buttons, I just want to know what I need to do, because I want them to be easy to find, and if I need them, I'll need to ask the project manager.. user interface: If you have questions project manager: If that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it was important to include video and D_V_D_ players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design. industrial designer: Yeah, I think there's a lot to be done, but there's no need to worry about it, because we have enough time to figure out what we need and what we want to do with it.. industrial Designer: So I think the main goal is to come up with a remote control that's simple, simple, and simple enough to be used by the user, but not too complicated, and with the right amount of power, and not too expensive.",

Hefin David am: So, for example, we've got a pilot project in Cardiff and Newport, where we're looking at how we can improve the quality and quality of early childhood education and childcare, and it's going to be important to ensure that parents have the support they need and that they have access to the services that they need. And, of course, we're going to continue to work closely with the local authorities to ensure they have the resources they need to meet the needs of their local communities. hefin david was: And what do you think about the cost of childcare in Wales? julie morgan am: Well, I think that it's fair to say that there's a cost to the government, but it's not too high, because we've been able to pay for it, and I think we'll be able to meet that cost, but we'll have to wait for the results of the pilot to see if it's worth it. sian gwenllian am: And do you have any further details on how the pilot will work? jo-anne daniels: Yes, it's a pilot, and the pilot is going to focus on eight local authorities in eight areas, including Swansea, Newport, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Cwmllwyn, Cefnys, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea and Swansea, with the aim of finding out whether they can meet the demand for childcare in these areas. So, it will be important for us to work with them to understand the needs and the challenges they face, and then we'll come up with a long-term plan for how to address them.",

We'll have to wait and see what happens, but it's likely that it won't be too long before we'll have a solution. And we'll see if we can find a good way to achieve it. Phd C: I think there's a good chance that we'll find a solution to this problem, because it's not that hard to do, but there is a lot to be done. We need to find the right combination of features to make it work. We have to make sure that we don't have too much noise, because if we have too many features, it's going to be hard to get a good signal, but if there's too little noise, it'll be impossible.",

Phd a: I don't think we'll be able to do that right now, but I'm sure we'll figure out how to do it in the future. phd e: I'm not sure if there's any other way to do this, but if there is a way, we can use it, we'll do it.. And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth, or and even on prosody, which Don is gonna be working on soon, it adds this extra, you know, vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar. So the room, it's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room and how it how the recordings are done, and that kind of thing.. phd A: Well, we have a lot of work to do on the audio, and I think we need to start with the speech portion of the presentation, and then we'll move on to the transcribing portion.",

We need to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that we meet the needs of our students, and that's why we've been working with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and they have been very helpful in their efforts to support the sector. We have a very positive working relationship with the higher education sector and I am looking forward to working with them to ensure a smooth transition to the new legislation. sian gwenllian am: I'm aware of the concerns raised by the Minister for Higher Education, Kirsty Williams AM, about the lack of transparency in the implementation of the Act, and it is important to note that the Minister has emphasised the importance of transparency, and the need for transparency in implementing the Act. However, she has also highlighted the need to ensure transparency and consistency in the way that the Act is implemented, as well as ensuring that the legislation is consistent with the Welsh Government's objectives. Kirsty, are there any plans to amend the Act in the future? Kirsty Willams Am: I think there is a need for a comprehensive review of the current legislation, but I think we will have to wait and see what the future holds for the sector in terms of how it evolves in the coming years. I think the future of higher education in Wales is uncertain, but we will continue to work closely with the government to ensure the success of the sector and ensure that it meets the needs and aspirations of Welsh students.",

The team also discussed the possibility of using the user as a model for the user, with the idea that they would have to decide whether they wanted to cross over the bridge or not. However, the team agreed that the person in Grenada would need to be a local person, as they would be unable to make a decision without knowing the location of the bridge. The group discussed the need for a user-friendly interface, and the professor proposed a new form that would allow the user to interact with the user in a way that would be familiar to them. The user would have the ability to choose between a variety of different options, including the option to choose a specific amount of money to spend or not spend, as well as deciding whether they would like to spend money on a specific item or not or whether they'd like to buy something else. The professor also suggested the creation of a new belief-net based on the user's decision-making process, which would allow them to choose the appropriate amount of time to spend on a particular item. He also suggested creating a belief net based on a user's decisions, which could be either a user or a user, or a person who has no idea what to do with their money. The belief -net would be used to determine whether the user would want to spend the money on something, or if they would prefer to spend it on something else, or what they would do with the money they have left over.",

User Interface: It would be nice if the remote control could be used to turn on and off the television, but it would cost too much money, and we don't want to spend too much on it. Industrial Designer: We need to think about the cost of the product, and if we have to spend more money, we can use the extra budget to buy a new remote control, or if we want to invest more money in the design of the device, we will have to pay more money for a more expensive remote control. Marketing: We have to decide whether or not to invest in a more advanced remote control or not, but if we do, it will cost more money than the current remote control because we will need to pay for a new one. We also need to decide on the price of the remote, as well as the amount of time it takes to produce it, as we are not sure how long it will take to produce the product. The project manager and the industrial designer discussed the possibility of incorporating a teletext remote control into the product as well, but they decided against it because they felt that it would not be cost-effective. They decided to focus on a simple remote control that would be easy to use and easy to understand, with a simple design that would appeal to a wide range of users. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be able to be controlled by a single button, and the project manager agreed. The user interface suggested the idea of using a simple button, but the team agreed that it was too expensive, and they decided to use a simpler design instead. The team then decided to incorporate a new button on the back of the T_V_ set, which would allow the user to control the remote by pressing one button at a time. They also decided to include a power button and a volume button, as they did not want to risk losing the remote in the middle of the night.",

We'll see how it goes and see what happens.. And the third point was the, yeah, the on - line normalization where, well, the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor A: Yeah. And so while discussing about these these LDA filters, some i issues appeared, like well,the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it's, well, we don't know really what's the important part in the frequencies, and there is the fact that in the very low frequency, these filters don't don't really remove a lot. and that's probably a reason why, yeah, on - screen normalization helps because it doesn't have to deal with the noise, but it does have the ability to filter out the noise. And we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result.

User Interface: But I think we can make it easier for people to find their remote control, and we can easily find it with the help of a button on the right side of the remote. The project manager agreed with the idea, and the team agreed to incorporate the idea into the design of the product. However, the industrial designer expressed concern about the cost of the project manager's idea, as the cost would be too high for a simple remote control. The team decided to focus on a simple design that would be easy to use and easy to maintain. The industrial designer proposed the idea of having a simple button that could be placed on the back of the device, but the team debated the feasibility of incorporating a button that would allow users to activate the remote without having to hold it in their hands. The group agreed on the need for a more advanced remote control that could interact with a variety of devices, including televisions, television sets, and other devices, and decided to include a button for the TV remote control in the device. The user interface proposed the use of an infrared light, which could be used to turn on and off the television, while the Industrial Designer suggested using a light to turn off the TV, and User Interface suggested using an LED light to illuminate the buttons. The Industrial Designer also suggested the incorporation of a motion sensor, which would allow the remote to be activated by pressing the power button, as well as the ability to activate it by pressing a button. The Project Manager agreed with User Interface's suggestion, and they decided to incorporate a light sensor into the device for the purpose of controlling the TV. They also discussed the possibility of adding a button to the remote that would activate the device when the user pressed it, but they were unable to find a way to incorporate it into the product due to budget constraints.

The user interface also suggested the addition of a voice recognition feature, which would allow the remote to be programmed with the user's voice, but they were unable to find it because it was too hard to program it.",
    "The Minister for Higher Education, Kirsty Williams Am, acknowledged the challenges faced by the tourism industry in Canada, and said that the government was working closely with the government to ensure that the sector was prepared for the challenges they faced. Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to recognise that there are many challenges facing the sector, and the government is working hard to address them. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. However, we'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think the Minister is currently content with the level of support that's being made available to the sector. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and why the strengthening is required? Kirsty Willams Am: Certainly, I see the remit letters as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the higher education funding bodies, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure they meet those priorities. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students, so, we've been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and we'll look to take forward in the new legislation.",
    "The team discussed the design of the remote control, with the project manager stating that it would be difficult to find a remote control that would fit comfortably in the hand, and the user interface stating that they would have to find the right remote control for each channel. The project manager suggested the idea of having a small remote control with buttons on the left and right side of the screen, which would allow the user to choose the channel they want to use. The user interface suggested that the remote should be able to navigate to the channel of their choice, and suggested that it should be easy to use and easy to understand. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition system into the remote, but the team decided to focus on the design instead. The group discussed the feasibility of using a simple remote control to control the TV, as it would reduce the cost of the device and reduce the need for a separate remote control. They also agreed that the design should not be too complicated, as there would be no need for buttons, as the remote would be easily accessible to the user, and that it could be used in a variety of scenarios, such as using the remote to turn on and off, or simply to turn off the TV. However, the team agreed that it was not necessary to include any buttons as they would only be needed for the most important functions. The industrial designer suggested the use of a simple, simple and easy-to-use remote control which could be placed in the center of the TV and easily accessible, while the marketing team suggested a more complex design, with buttons for different channels, buttons for channels and channels, and a power button for volume control. The marketing team also suggested the addition of a voice control, which was agreed upon by the industrial designer and user interface team. The remote control should be simple to use, with a simple and user-friendly look and feel, and it should not require a lot of buttons as the user would not have to hold it in their hand.",

The project manager also suggested that the device should be made of plastic, and that it should be easy to use, as it would be easy for the user to hold it in their hand. However, the team realized that it would not be possible to use a plastic remote control, as the plastic material would be too slippery, so they decided to incorporate a rubber material into the device instead. The team also decided to include a screen on the front and back of the device, which would make it easier for users to hold the device in their hands. The remote control should have a large screen, and the user interface team decided to add a screen to the front of the remote, as they felt it would make the device easier to hold and easier to use. They also considered the possibility of incorporating a speech recognition feature, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost and complexity of the project. The group decided to focus on the design of the product, and it was decided that the design would be based on the concept of a remote control with a screen and a battery, with a battery and a screen, as opposed to a traditional remote control. The idea of using a battery was discussed, but the team decided not to use it because they felt that it was too expensive, and they did not want to waste money on a battery when they could use a smaller battery for a smaller device.",
    "The group discussed the possibility of using the data as a training set for training and testing the digits corpus, as well as a test set, with the goal of creating a corpus that is similar to the standard training set, which would allow them to train the machine to recognize the digits. The group agreed that they would need to train and test the digits, but they were not sure if they would be able to do it in a timely manner due to the limited amount of time they had to work with the data. They also discussed the feasibility of using a speech recognition algorithm, as they were unsure of the accuracy of the speech recognition, and whether it would be possible to use it in the future. However, they were confident that it would not be too difficult to train it, as it would only take a couple of days to train. The team also agreed that it was possible to create a new version of the presegmentation algorithm based on the input data, and that it could be used to generate different types of data, such as speech, speech, and speech. They were also confident that they could train the system to recognize different kinds of speech, as long as they did not have to deal with a lot of noise, and they had a good idea of what they needed to do in terms of training the system.",
    "User Interface: I think it would be a good idea to have a remote control with a lot of buttons on it, but I don't think it's practical to have too many buttons, because it's not practical to use them all at once. Industrial designer: It would be nice to be able to control the remote with just one button, but it would cost too much money. User Interface: But I think we can do it with just a single button, and I think that would be the most convenient. Marketing: I agree with you, but we need to find a way to make it easier for people to use the remote control, and we have to think about how to achieve that. Industrial Designer: Well, I think the idea of having a button on the right side of the remote should be appealing to people who are not used to having buttons on the side of their remote control. Project Manager: We have to make sure that the buttons are easy to find and easy to use, and that they are not too hard to reach, and the buttons should be easy to reach as well. The project manager: We need to make the remote remote control more user-friendly, so we can make it easy for the user to use it, and it can be easily accessible, and there should be no buttons in the middle of the device. The remote control should have a light on the top and bottom, so that it doesn't get in the way of the user's view, and they can see what's going on. The user interface team agreed with the project manager that the design should be simple and simple, with a simple design, but they also agreed that it should not be too complicated. They also agreed on the need for a simple and easy-to-use remote control that can be used in the dark, as well as the need to be simple to use. The industrial designer suggested the use of a light in the device, which could be used to turn on and off the TV, but the idea was rejected by the marketing team, who believed that it would require too much time and effort. The team decided to focus on a simpler design, as they believed that a simple remote control would be easier to use than a complicated one. The marketing team also suggested the inclusion of a button that could be placed on the left-hand side, as it would allow users to easily find the remote, while the industrial designer believed that the user interface would be more easily accessible.",

The project manager proposed the use of a single button on the right side of the screen, which would allow users to control the remote by pressing it with their hands, and they would be able to control it by pressing the power button. However, the team realized that this would not be practical, as the buttons would have to be placed in the same position as the other buttons, which could be difficult due to the size of the buttons. User Interface: We need to find a way to make the buttons more ergonomic, and we need to minimize the amount of buttons and minimize the number of buttons, as well as the size and shape of the circuit board. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to have a simple button, as it will make it easier for people to find the remote, and it will be easier for them to find it easily. user interface: It would be nice if there was a button for the volume button, but I think that it's not necessary, as long as it's easy to find. Industrial Designer: I agree with User Interface, and I think this is a very interesting idea, but it's going to cost a lot of money. We have to think about how we can make it cost-effective, but we have to make sure that it doesn't cost too much money.",

They also decided to include a microphone on the top of the remote, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice, but they didn't want to use a remote with a microphone, as it would interfere with the user's ability to use the remote. The industrial designer suggested that the remote should be shaped like a clay, and the project manager agreed, as he believed that it was a good idea. The project manager suggested using a plastic case for the remote and the industrial designer agreed with him, as long as it was not too expensive. The marketing team agreed with the team on the cost of the case, as well as the price, and agreed to pay for it, although they did not want to pay more than twelve hundred Euros for the case. However, they were not satisfied with the cost, as there was no guarantee that they would be able to sell it to the consumer, as the cost was too high for them to afford it. The group agreed that the price would have to be lower than the price of the original model, and it was decided that the cost would be less than five hundred Euros. The Industrial Designer and User Interface team agreed on a price of six hundred Euros, which was agreed upon by the marketing team, while the Project Manager and Industrial Designer agreed on seven hundred Euros and five hundred euros respectively.",
    "Phd e: I think it would be interesting to see if there is a difference between the two systems, because we have a lot of data to work with, and we need to make sure that we have enough data to train on it. professor a: I don't know if there's a difference, but I think there is one difference, and that is that the SRI system has a lot more data than ours, whereas ours has less data, but it's not enough to make a difference in terms of accuracy. professor A: So we have to decide whether or not we want to use it or not, but if we do, we'll have to find a way to incorporate it in the future. We'll see if we can incorporate it into a future version of the system or if it's too expensive to do it now, but we'll see what happens when we have more data.. The problem is that it's very big and we still have to think how to place it and where to put it and, professor a has to decide if it should be on the front end or on the back end of the device, or if they should be placed on the side of the machine. The idea is to have the front - end on the left and the back-end on the right, so that the front-end is in the center and the left-hand side is in front of the center, and the right side is behind the center.

    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals, but in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on Free School Meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wales, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free school-meal counterparts. One of the things that they've used its PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school, so, that's a universal thing that they have trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate amount of impact on those children, and now they're at the same level. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. llyr gruffydd am: And I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions. llilyr: So, are you content that the PDG should be used at the coalface?

    "dafydd evans: I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular\u2014the civil engineering sector\u2014and particularly the contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to\u2014. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would be true of a lot of employers as well. But, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. nick brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bach\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within those professional sectors. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh baac initially, but the Welsh Baac has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting on a lot more pressure on. And whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable, and, as I said, we need to link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools, so that we can have a far more structured way of getting employers into schools. At the moment, it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it. kay martin: We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which are one of the top law firms in the world, so, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. sian gwenllian am: If there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it?",

The industrial designer proposed the idea of having a remote control in the shape of a human hand, which was agreed upon by the team, but User Interface was skeptical about the feasibility of this idea. The group agreed that they would need to find a way to integrate the remote into the user's hands, as the device would be too heavy to be carried around in the hand.",
    "The Industrial Designer and the Project Manager agreed on the need for a new design for the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting the use of rubber as a material, while the User Interface suggested using rubber as the material, as it would be more durable and less expensive. The Project Manager suggested using a rubber material for the buttons, as they would be easier to handle and more durable. The Industrial Designer agreed, but the Marketing team disagreed with the idea of using rubber, believing that the rubber would be too hard to handle. The User Interface team agreed, however, and suggested incorporating rubber into the design in the form of a rubber case, which could be placed on the front of the remote. The project manager agreed to this idea, as long as the user interface team agreed with it. The Marketing team also agreed to the idea, but they were concerned about the cost of the product, as the project manager believed that it would cost too much money to produce a new remote control. They also believed that the product should be made of rubber, as there was no other material that could be used in the case, and they would have to buy a new material for it.",
    "sally jenkins: I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of different views on this issue, and we need to be careful not to overstate the impact of the Bill, but we do agree that it is important to have a clear definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, and it is also important to ensure that the Bill is inclusive and inclusive. We need to make sure that there is a level playing field for all parties involved in this process, so that children and families have the opportunity to be heard and to be supported. We know that this is a difficult issue for families, but it is something that needs to be addressed, and that's what we're working to do. I think that we have to be mindful of the fact that it's a complex issue and there are many different perspectives on it, and there's a variety of views on how to address it. However, we are committed to ensuring that this Bill is implemented in a way that respects the rights of children and their rights, as well as the needs of families and children's services. We have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of all children in Wales, and the Bill aims to do that by ensuring that children are cared for in a safe environment and that they receive the support they need.",

    "The project manager and User Interface agreed on the need for a new remote control that would be easy to find and easy to use, as well as an ergonomic design that would allow users to find the remote control easily. The project manager suggested the idea of using a curved design for the keypad, as it would be more ergonomic than the current remote control, which has a flat surface. User Interface suggested that the design of the remote should be based on the shape of the screen, and the project manager agreed with User Interface that it would not be too complicated. The industrial designer suggested a simple design, with a simple and easy-to-use design, but the user interface suggested a more complex design, in which the user would be able to choose between different channels and channels. The user interface proposed a simple remote control with buttons on the left and right sides, and a button on the right side to control the volume, while the industrial designer proposed a more complicated design with buttons for volume control and a power button for the power button and a volume button for volume. However, User Interface argued that it was not necessary to have a volume control, as the remote would be easily accessible, and it would only be necessary for the user to hold it in their hand. The Project Manager agreed to this idea, but User Interface expressed concerns about the cost, as they believed that the cost would be too high for a remote control of this size. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer regarding the cost of the new remote, and they agreed that the price would be reasonable."
