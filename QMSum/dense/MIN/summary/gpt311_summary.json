    "During the project discussions, the industrial designer suggested that the new remote control should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. They also mentioned the need to set points to drive the project and discussed receiving an email about it. The project manager proposed assigning responsibilities based on the mail received from the account manager. There was some confusion regarding the industrial designer's role, but it was eventually resolved.\n\nThe industrial designer and the project manager agreed to have a discussion about the project and gather information. The industrial designer mentioned that they wanted to create a new remote control for TV distribution, considering the technical points. The project manager emphasized the importance of not making it too costly. The industrial designer and the user interface designer discussed the idea of having a function to choose between TV channels or the contents of the program.\n\nThe user interface designer suggested having only six or seven buttons for different categories, making it easier for users to choose among the sorted list of programs. The industrial designer mentioned that navigating through the channel program or content on the TV screen would be possible using navigation buttons and the user interface. The project manager and the user interface designer liked this idea and agreed that it would be revolutionary.\n\nThe project manager concluded that the most important function of the remote control would be to choose the content, whether it be by channel or by content. They also mentioned the need to check how to gather data from programs or contents. The user interface designer suggested using a whiteboard to further discuss the ideas. The marketing representative added the idea of having a light adaptation system that adjusts the lights based on the picture on the screen.\n\nFrom the team presentations, the project manager drew the conclusion that the main aspect to focus on is the functional design of the remote control, specifically the ability to choose content. They agreed to meet again in five minutes to discuss other aspects of the project.",
    "During the meeting, the User Interface, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager discussed the characteristics of a new remote control. The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. The Project Manager mentioned the need to set project goals and asked if an email was sent regarding this. The User Interface confirmed receiving an email about the designs. The Marketing representative emphasized the importance of considering all aspects and suggested gathering more information.\n\nThe User Interface and Industrial Designer mentioned confusion about their responsibilities from the account manager, but agreed to have a discussion about their tasks. The Industrial Designer stated the need for a new remote control for TV distribution, and the Project Manager added that it should be cost-effective.\n\nThe User Interface asked about the most important function of a remote control and proposed a feature where users can see a list of programs for the night. The Project Manager expressed concern about the cost of adding too much technology. The Industrial Designer suggested using navigation buttons for program selection and mentioned the possibility of needing navigation buttons for users to choose from a list of programs.\n\nThe Marketing representative suggested that the main function of a remote control is to have something in hand and questioned the feasibility of adding a speech recognition system due to the remote control's slim size. The User Interface agreed and suggested that the TV itself could have a speech recognition system. The Industrial Designer agreed that there should be a function to choose between TV channels or program contents, and the Project Manager supported this idea.\n\nThe User Interface proposed having six or seven buttons for different categories and using the same button to choose from a sorted list of programs. The Industrial Designer suggested using navigation buttons and the TV screen interface for navigation. The Project Manager agreed and suggested displaying the options on the TV screen rather than the remote control.\n\nThe User Interface mentioned that TV remote controls tend to have many buttons, which can be confusing for users. They also mentioned the need to figure out how to gather data from programs or contents for technical implementation. The Marketing representative suggested incorporating a light adaptation system that adjusts the lights based on the TV screen picture. The User Interface asked whether they should focus on a conceptual remote control or just the functions.\n\nIn summary, the prototype of the remote control introduced by the User Interface, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager aimed for a user-friendly design that allows easy program or content selection. The discussed details included using navigation buttons and the TV screen for navigation, having six or seven buttons for different categories, and considering a light adaptation system. The goal was to create a trendy, user-friendly, and cost-effective universal remote control.",
    "During the interactive evaluation, the User Interface and Industrial Designer disagreed on the price of the product. The User Interface believed that certain features could be replaced with simpler and more cost-effective alternatives, while the Industrial Designer believed these features were important for functionality and appeal. The User Interface focused on meeting budget constraints, while the Industrial Designer prioritized features and design.\n\nThe User Interface also disagreed on the redesign after product evaluation. They believed there was room for creativity and improvement, while the Industrial Designer and Marketing team preferred to stick to the existing design and features, believing they met user requirements and followed current trends.\n\nWhen discussing product appearance, the User Interface suggested yellow and red as the basic colors. They believed these colors were user-friendly and commonly associated with remote controls. Red, in particular, is often used for numerical buttons. The choice of colors was based on familiarity and usability in the context of remote controls.\n\nIn terms of the shape of the product, the User Interface designer suggested a curvy shape resembling a vegetable. However, the marketing team found it phallic and not aesthetically pleasing. They preferred a more traditional and practical shape, such as a flat surface rubber design. The disagreement stemmed from differing opinions on visual appeal and marketability.",
    "During the meeting, the group discussed various technical issues related to the design of the remote control. The user interface person mentioned identifying the basic components and the need for feedback from the marketing and user interface person for further refinement. They also mentioned removing teletext functionality and incorporating the company's standard colors and slogan.\n\nRegarding the energy source, the user interface person explained that they had identified a source that feeds energy into the chip. They mentioned the chip generating a response when a button is pressed and sending it to an infrared terminal, which communicates with the remote site that has an infrared receiver. Keeping the design simple was preferred to avoid complicating the chip with new functions.\n\nThe project manager announced the creation of a shared project documents folder and requested team members to email their presentations. They also mentioned the need for a decision on the target group and the functions of the remote control. The industrial designer sought clarification on the target group, which the project manager explained as the group of people the product will be sold to.\n\nThe marketing person shared survey results on remote control use, highlighting the power, channel selection, and volume selection buttons as the main functions utilized. They mentioned the current remote controls not aligning well with user behavior and the demand for a stylish and ergonomic design. The possibility of incorporating voice recognition software was discussed, with younger people being more likely to pay more for this feature.\n\nIn conclusion, the group discussed technical issues, the energy source, the project announcement email, and the sample sensor. They also considered incorporating voice recognition software and the importance of a stylish and ergonomic design. The project manager requested email presentations and mentioned that the next meeting would involve further discussions and decision-making.",
    "The team discussed the presentations and the lack of access to all of them in the shared folder. The industrial designer mentioned difficulty with PowerPoint and requested assistance.
