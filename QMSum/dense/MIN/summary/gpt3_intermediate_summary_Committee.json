        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the financial challenges facing universities in Wales. These challenges include a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, uncertainty due to the Augar review and Brexit, and a funding gap between Wales and England. The Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), David Blaney, stated that while there are financial challenges, they are being managed and he does not foresee any institutions falling over in the foreseeable future. However, he did acknowledge that there may be an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales.\n\nIn terms of governance arrangements, the governing bodies of universities are expected to follow the guidance provided by the Committee of University Chairs (CUC) in order to ensure good governance practices. The role of the governing body becomes even more significant in times of financial pressure. HEFCW encourages governing bodies to engage in a process of continual refreshing to bring in different perspectives. There is also a need for a consistent minimum set of expectations for governance, while also recognizing the autonomy of the institutions.\n\nRegarding part-time student funding, HEFCW has allocated \u00a326 million for 2019-20 to support part-time provision. They have also provided additional funding for collaboration between higher education and further education institutions. However, the sustainability of part-time student funding within current arrangements is a challenge due to the price sensitivity of part-time students and the need for continued investment.\n\nIn terms of research funding, HEFCW recognizes the importance of maintaining QR funding to support the research base in Wales. However, the funding has not increased in real terms for the past nine years. HEFCW is working to improve the accessibility of information on research funding and is collaborating with stakeholders to develop a vision for research and innovation in Wales. The impact of Brexit on research funding and the loss of European Union funds are also a concern, and HEFCW is working to mitigate this impact through strategic funding and collaboration with UK research bodies.\n\nIn conclusion, the discussion highlighted the financial challenges facing universities in Wales, the importance of good governance practices, the need for continued investment in part-time student funding and research, and the impact of Brexit on research funding. HEFCW is working to address these challenges and support the higher education sector in Wales."

        "In the meeting, the opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance of individual institutions were not specifically discussed. However, it was mentioned that the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 aimed to regulate institutions in Wales, safeguard the financial support provided by the Welsh Government, maintain fair access, and protect institutional autonomy. The effectiveness of these aims was discussed, with different views on whether they had been achieved.\n\nSian Gwenllian AM inquired about quality assurance and Kirsty Williams AM responded by stating that the 2015 Act contains provisions that protect institutional autonomy while ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability. They also discussed the need for national outcomes to be reflected in outcome agreements and the importance of ensuring that private providers meet quality standards.\n\nIn terms of fee and access plans, Kirsty Williams AM acknowledged that there may be room for improvement and suggested that a longer-term approach and focus on outcomes rather than inputs could be more effective. She also mentioned the ongoing review of governance in universities and the intention to address governance issues in the new PCET Bill.\n\nRegarding the single quality assurance body, Kirsty Williams AM stated that stakeholders have expressed concerns and that the government is exploring options to ensure a coherent, effective, and comprehensive quality assurance regime that is compatible with national and international standards.\n\nThe issue of transnational education was briefly discussed, with emphasis on the need for appropriate quality guarantees to protect the reputation of Welsh institutions.\n\nOverall, while specific opinions on the role of local authorities in quality assurance were not discussed, the meeting provided insights into the government's views on quality assurance, governance, and the future direction of the higher education sector in Wales."

        "In the meeting, there were discussions on various topics including the integration of human rights in the new curriculum, issues in special education and recruitment of professional staff, challenges in training staff for special education, emphasis on the more able and talented stream, standards in special schools, and the trend of teacher recruiting along with the reasons and steps taken.\n\nIn terms of the increase in exclusions from school, the main reasons discussed were the prevalence of challenging behavior, particularly in relation to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the struggle to provide the right provision for learners with additional learning needs. There was also a mention of the pressure on schools to perform and the culture of accountability that may contribute to exclusions.\n\nIn terms of strategies for support and reintegration, local authorities were mentioned to have clear strategies in place, such as behavior and well-being strategies that have a tiered approach to provide universal provision and specialized support for learners at risk of exclusion or disengagement. However, there was an acknowledgment that there is still work to be done to bring all local authorities up to the same level of consistency.\n\nThe impact of school accountability measures on exclusions was discussed, with the recognition that there are pressures on schools to perform, and this may have an impact on exclusions. However, it was noted that the new measures being put in place, such as the capped 9, are aimed at improving the situation.\n\nIn terms of engaging parents of children in EOTAS or at risk of becoming EOTAS, it was mentioned that local authorities are working with a team-around-the-family approach, bringing together different agencies to proactively solve problems and support families. It was noted that the majority of local authorities have clear strategies in place for engaging parents and working collaboratively.\n\nRegarding funding challenges, it was acknowledged that funding issues can lead to more exclusions, particularly in relation to additional learning needs. It was mentioned that the new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) Act may place additional pressure on the system, and there was a need for increased funding to meet the requirements of the new Act.\n\nThe challenges in providing a broad and balanced curriculum for learners in EOTAS settings were discussed, with an emphasis on the need for collaboration between PRUs and schools to ensure learners have access to appropriate learning opportunities. The issue of capacity and the availability of specialist staff in EOTAS settings was also mentioned as a challenge.\n\nIn terms of mental health support, it was acknowledged that there may be variations in access to mental health services for EOTAS learners, particularly in relation to the capacity of health boards. The importance of collaboration between education and health services was highlighted, as well as the need for a universal approach to well-being support in schools.\n\nThe meeting also touched on issues related to transport for EOTAS learners, particularly in rural areas. It was mentioned that the distances learners have to travel can be a significant challenge.\n\nOverall, the discussions in the meeting highlighted the various challenges and issues related to the integration of human rights",
        "During the meeting, several discussions took place regarding the integration of human rights in the new curriculum, issues in special education and the recruitment of professional staff, challenges in training staff for special education, emphasis on the more able and talented stream, standards in special schools, and the trend of teacher recruiting along with the reasons and steps taken.\n\nIn relation to the integration of human rights in the new curriculum, there was a concern about the reductionist approach to discussions on exclusion from schools. It was noted that there is a lack of understanding of the underlying factors influencing exclusion, and that schools need to consider the individual needs and circumstances of each student. It was suggested that there should be a whole-school approach to support learners and ensure that their rights are protected.\n\nRegarding issues in special education and recruitment of professional staff, it was highlighted that there is a lack of awareness and knowledge of children with additional learning needs. This can lead to mislabeling of children as \"naughty\" or disruptive, instead of recognizing their underlying needs. It was suggested that proper training and support for teachers is necessary to ensure that they can effectively support these students.\n\nChallenges in training staff for special education were also discussed, with a focus on the need for teachers to have an understanding response and be confident in supporting students with mental health issues. It was emphasized that the curriculum should include training on mental health awareness and that this training should be embedded in initial teacher training.\n\nThe emphasis on the more able and talented stream was raised as a concern, with a suggestion that schools should be measured on the journey traveled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of vulnerable children. It was noted that the current focus on academic outcomes can lead to the exclusion of students who may not be attaining brilliant grades but still have potential and other talents.\n\nStandards in special schools were also discussed, with a call for a compassionate and informed response from everyone in the school community to support distressed young people. It was suggested that the whole-school approach should be statutory to ensure that support is provided consistently and effectively.\n\nThe trend of teacher recruiting was discussed, with a focus on the need for a child-centered approach and the importance of considering what support is best for each individual student. It was noted that there is a lack of data and information on the support currently provided, and that more qualitative and quantitative research is needed to understand the experiences of young people and identify areas for improvement.\n\nIn terms of supporting learners at risk of becoming EOTAS (Education Other Than at School), it was suggested that a whole-school approach should be implemented to ensure that learners are supported and that their emotional and mental health needs are prioritized. The importance of learner voice and involving young people in decision-making processes was emphasized.\n\nThe impact of early trauma (ACEs - Adverse Childhood Experiences) on learners and how schools are adapting their practices to take account of them was also discussed. It was noted that there is a need for more research and understanding"

        "During the meeting, the discussion focused on amendments related to the duty to promote public awareness and the duty to report on the effect of the legislation. Julie Morgan, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, explained that her amendments aimed to place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law regarding the defence of reasonable punishment. She highlighted that these amendments were in response to a recommendation from the committee in their Stage 1 report.\n\nHowever, Janet Finch-Saunders proposed amendments that included additional requirements for the awareness-raising campaign, such as promoting understanding of the law change and providing details about support available to parents. She also suggested that there should be clear advice on what people can do if they witness a child being physically assaulted. Finch-Saunders argued that these amendments were necessary to ensure that the public fully understood the implications of the legislation.\n\nDuring the discussion, concerns were raised about the length of the post-implementation review period. Some members felt that waiting seven years to formally evaluate the effectiveness of the legislation was too long. Suzy Davies suggested a three-year reporting period would be more appropriate and urged the Deputy Minister to consider this.\n\nIn response, the Deputy Minister expressed her commitment to conducting a thorough review of the legislation's impact. She explained that attitudinal surveys would be used to track changes in public opinion and prevalence of physical punishment. Additionally, a task and finish group was working on capturing data and considering the possible impact on services.\n\nThe Deputy Minister rejected amendments 2A, 2C, and amendments 2E to 2K, stating that they were unnecessary or covered by the Government's amendments. However, she expressed willingness to consult with the committee and provide an interim report before the commencement of section 1.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the importance of promoting public awareness and evaluating the impact of the legislation. The Deputy Minister's amendments aimed to address these concerns, and further discussions and consultations were planned to ensure effective implementation of the legislation.",

        "During the meeting, concerns were raised regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. It was mentioned that there has been a drop in EU student applications in Wales, which is a cause for concern. This drop is attributed to the change in government policy regarding student support, specifically the removal of the tuition fee grant for EU students. It was acknowledged that this change may have had an impact on EU recruitment in the higher education sector.\n\nThe Welsh Government expressed its commitment to implementing the Diamond and Reid reviews, which aim to provide sustainable funding for the higher education sector. It was mentioned that funding commitments have been made to HEFCW (Higher Education Funding Council for Wales) to support the implementation of these reviews.\n\nIn terms of funding for apprenticeships, it was noted that the European funding programs (such as ESF and ERDF) provide multi-year funding, which gives a sense of security and stability to the sectors. However, there is uncertainty regarding funding beyond 2020, as it depends on the outcome of Brexit negotiations. The Welsh Government expressed its hope that the UK Government will fulfill its promises to maintain funding for apprenticeships.\n\nThe importance of collaboration between different government departments was highlighted, as the impact of Brexit extends beyond the education sector. Efforts are being made to engage with various sectors and assess the potential impact of Brexit on their workforce and skills needs. It was mentioned that the Welsh Government is working on developing policies, such as rural skills, to address specific needs and mitigate any negative impact of Brexit.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the concerns and challenges faced by the education sector in Wales due to Brexit.

        "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. She explained that her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. She also mentioned that she considered other amendments related to the duty to raise awareness, but found them unnecessary or duplicative. \n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2, which would require Welsh Ministers to undertake a post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment. She explained that this review would be conducted through attitudinal surveys and data collection, and would be an ongoing process during the years following the commencement of the legislation. She also addressed amendment 2C, which would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before the legislation comes into force. The Deputy Minister argued that this amendment is unnecessary and conflicts with the need for certainty on the commencement date. She assured the committee that the effectiveness of the awareness-raising campaign would be assessed through other means, such as surveys and data collection.\n\nDuring the discussion, other members of the committee expressed their views on the amendments. Some members raised concerns about the duration of the post-implementation review, suggesting that a seven-year period is too long and recommending a shorter reporting period, such as three years. They also discussed the need for clarity on the contents of the interim report and the importance of consulting with the committee and other stakeholders in defining the terms of the report. The Deputy Minister expressed willingness to consult with the committee on the contents of the interim report and to consider a shorter reporting period.",

The Deputy Minister expressed her appreciation for the suggestions made by the members and stated that all the areas raised by them were relevant. She assured the members that the suggestions would be considered and reported to the relevant groups. She also mentioned that regular reporting of public attitudes would be conducted and that the costs associated with the post-implementation review would be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment. The Deputy Minister emphasized that the impacts of similar legislation in other countries did not result in overwhelming public services and that there was no evidence of runaway costs. She assured the members that the potential impact on public services would be carefully monitored and managed. The Deputy Minister also highlighted the importance of the close working relationship with the Crown Prosecution Service and the police in ensuring the effective implementation of the legislation. In response to the members' concerns about the potential consequences of the legislation, the Deputy Minister stated that the legislation would not criminalize parents but rather aim to stop them from physically punishing their children. She acknowledged that the issue of sentencing and guidance for the CPS and the police was outside the control of the Welsh Government but emphasized the ongoing collaboration and discussion with these bodies. The Deputy Minister opposed the amendments that sought to make the commencement of the Bill conditional on specific factors such as revised CPS guidance or the establishment of parenting support services, as she believed it would be inappropriate to give non-devolved bodies the power to determine the commencement of Welsh legislation. She emphasized the need for certainty in the commencement date of the Bill to allow key partners to plan and deliver their work effectively. The Deputy Minister expressed her willingness to continue engaging with the members and considering their concerns during the Stage 3 proceedings of the Bill."
