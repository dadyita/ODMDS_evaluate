    "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the financial challenges facing universities in Wales. These challenges include a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, uncertainty due to the Augar review and Brexit, and a funding gap between Wales and England. The Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), David Blaney, believes that these challenges are being managed and does not foresee any institutions falling over in the foreseeable future. However, he does acknowledge that there may be an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales.\n\nIn terms of governance arrangements, the governing bodies of universities are expected to follow the guidance provided by the Committee of University Chairs (CUC) to ensure good governance practices. The role of the governing body becomes even more significant in times of financial pressure. HEFCW encourages governing bodies to engage in a process of continual refreshing to bring in different perspectives. There is also a need for a consistent minimum set of expectations for governance while recognizing the autonomy of the institutions.\n\nRegarding part-time student funding, HEFCW has allocated \u00a326 million for 2019-20 to support part-time provision. They have also provided additional funding for collaboration between higher education and further education institutions. However, the sustainability of part-time student funding within current arrangements is a challenge due to the price sensitivity of part-time students and the need for continued investment.\n\nIn terms of research funding, HEFCW recognizes the importance of maintaining QR funding to support the research base in Wales. However, the funding has not increased in real terms for the past nine years. HEFCW is working to improve the accessibility of information on research funding and is collaborating with stakeholders to develop a vision for research and innovation in Wales. The impact of Brexit on research funding and the loss of European Union funds are also concerns, and HEFCW is working to mitigate this impact through strategic funding and collaboration with UK research bodies.\n\nIn conclusion, the discussion highlighted the financial challenges facing universities in Wales, the importance of good governance practices, the need for continued investment in part-time student funding and research, and the impact of Brexit on research funding. HEFCW is working to address these challenges and support the higher education sector in Wales.",

    "The financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are attributed to several factors. These include a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and the uncertainty caused by the Augar review in England and Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales and universities across the UK are also facing financial pressures.\n\nOne significant issue is the funding gap between Welsh higher education institutions and their counterparts in England, which amounts to approximately \u00a340 million. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which provide increased funding for higher education, is seen as important for addressing these challenges. However, it is acknowledged that the current funding is insufficient and more investment is needed to maintain capacity and deliver quality education.\n\nGovernance is seen as crucial in ensuring the financial sustainability of institutions. Governing bodies are responsible for overseeing financial matters and should engage in continual refreshing to bring in diverse perspectives and expertise. Transparency in reporting financial information, including fee income and expenditure, is also emphasized to improve understanding of how universities utilize their funds.\n\nThe increase in part-time student numbers in Wales necessitates additional funding and support. Collaboration between higher education and further education institutions is incentivized through funding allocations. Affordable accommodation for under-represented groups is also a priority, with specific initiatives and funding allocations in place to achieve this goal.\n\nResearch funding is another key area of concern. Increased investment in research and innovation is seen as necessary, along with maintaining QR funding and universities' access to UK-wide funding opportunities. The impact of Brexit on research funding is acknowledged, and efforts are being made to improve transparency in reporting research funding and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of Brexit.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector and emphasized the importance of proper governance, transparency, and increased investment in research and innovation to ensure its sustainability and success.",
    "Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, has expressed his opinion on the impact of Brexit on Wales' higher education system. He stated that the uncertainty surrounding the relationships and arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management. The drop in EU students applying to study in Wales could be attributed to changes in student support arrangements and the relative levels of investment in facilities and infrastructure between Wales and England.\n\nTo counteract this drop in EU student applications, Dr. Blaney emphasized the importance of Wales promoting itself as a safe and supportive place to study. He also stressed the need for continued investment in capital infrastructure and the importance of institutions being prepared for potential turbulence caused by Brexit.\n\nDr. Blaney acknowledged the challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector, including funding issues, reduced student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and uncertainty surrounding the Augar review of fees and funding in England. He suggested that institutions should focus on attracting students through marketing efforts and strengthening global engagement.\n\nIn terms of student mobility, Dr. Blaney discussed the potential impact of Brexit on programs like Erasmus+ and emphasized the need for Wales to find alternative ways to support student mobility. He mentioned the sector's collaboration with the National Union of Students and the efforts to protect student interests.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Blaney highlighted the importance of maintaining the quality of education and research in Wales, as well as the need for continued investment in infrastructure and attracting research funding. He also discussed the barriers to gaining more funding from UK research councils, including the need for increased investment and greater engagement with the research councils.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. David Blaney believes that Brexit has significant implications for Wales' higher education system. He emphasizes the need for institutions to address the drop in EU student applications by promoting Wales as a safe and supportive place to study. Additionally, Dr. Blaney highlights the challenges facing the sector, including funding issues and reduced student recruitment, and suggests focusing on marketing efforts and global engagement.

    "During a meeting, the discussion focused on amendments related to promoting public awareness and reporting on the effect of legislation. Julie Morgan explained her amendments aimed at increasing awareness about a change in the law regarding the defence of reasonable punishment.

    "WISERD research has raised concerns about the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. One specific concern is the drop in EU student applications in Wales, which is attributed to changes in government policy regarding student support, particularly the removal of the tuition fee grant for EU students. This change may have had an impact on EU recruitment in higher education.\n\nThe Welsh Government has expressed its commitment to implementing the Diamond and Reid reviews, which aim to provide sustainable funding for the higher education sector. Funding commitments have been made to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) to support the implementation of these reviews.\n\nThere is also concern about funding for apprenticeships, as European funding programs (such as ESF and ERDF) currently provide multi-year funding, which gives stability to the sector. However, there is uncertainty about funding beyond 2020 due to Brexit negotiations. The Welsh Government hopes that the UK Government will fulfill its promises to maintain funding for apprenticeships.\n\nCollaboration between different government departments is seen as important, as the impact of Brexit extends beyond the education sector. Efforts are being made to engage with various sectors and assess the potential impact of Brexit on their workforce and skills needs. The Welsh Government is developing policies, such as rural skills, to address specific needs and mitigate any negative impact of Brexit.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the concerns and challenges faced by the education sector in Wales due to Brexit. The Welsh Government is working to address these concerns and ensure the sustainability and resilience of the sector.",
    "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. She explained that her amendments 1 and 4 would require Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law and the prohibition of physical punishment. She considered other amendments related to raising awareness but found them unnecessary. \n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2, which would require Welsh Ministers to conduct a post-implementation review through surveys and data collection. She also addressed amendment 2C, which would require a report on the effect of public awareness efforts. She argued that this amendment is unnecessary and conflicts with the need for certainty on the commencement date.\n\nDuring the discussion, committee members expressed concerns about the duration of the post-implementation review and suggested a shorter reporting period. They also discussed the contents of the interim report and the need for consultation with the committee and stakeholders. The Deputy Minister expressed willingness to consult on the contents of the report and consider a shorter reporting period.\n\nThe Deputy Minister assured the committee that all their suggestions would be considered and reported to the relevant groups. Regular reporting of public attitudes would be conducted, and the costs of the review would be provided in a revised assessment. The Deputy Minister emphasized that similar legislation in other countries did not result in overwhelming costs and that the impact on public services would be carefully monitored. She highlighted the importance of working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service and the police for effective implementation.\n\nIn response to concerns about potential consequences, the Deputy Minister stated that the legislation aims to stop physical punishment, not criminalize parents. She acknowledged that sentencing and guidance were outside the control of the Welsh Government but emphasized ongoing collaboration with relevant bodies. The Deputy Minister opposed amendments that would make the commencement of the Bill conditional on specific factors, as it would be inappropriate to give non-devolved bodies that power. She stressed the need for certainty in the commencement date for effective planning.\n\nThe Deputy Minister expressed willingness to continue engaging with the members and considering their concerns during the next stage of the Bill."
