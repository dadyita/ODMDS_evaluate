        "professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .",
        " professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate .",
        " You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off "

But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. So, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events. We also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. We'll all be familiar, won't we, with the narrative of, 'Oh, we're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for'. So we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say. So, Members, I'm sure, will have been aware of the specific pages on Hwb that outlined the draft curriculum, and we had 275,000 unique visits to the Hwb curriculum pages. It's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience\u2014which particular AoLEs were the most popular and were being looked at the most\u2014with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular. So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change? So, support for the need for change, and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. Strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession\u2014so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas\u2014. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance? kirsty williams am: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\u00a0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen\u2014absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020? kirsty williams am: Okay. We call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire? claire bennett: Yes. sian gwenllian am: You've touched on the point that there's going to be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. kirsty williams am: The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody\u2014. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber\u2014I can see Suzy is writing this down\u2014Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. One of the consistent worries that some people have had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school, but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern. I set up a process\u2014this was an open process, and we were open to listening to people. So, I think those will be the two main areas where we hadn't originally thought that we would legislate for, but that we will now legislate for. I haven't got the 'what matters'\u00a0statements in front of me\u2014 kirsty williams am: Well, if you remember, we have the four purposes, and then we have the areas of learning and experience, and then, below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience. Some of the feedback that we've had is that\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, will you be adding to those? kirsty williams am: Adding is not necessarily\u2014no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention. Will they include mental health and well-being? kirsty williams am: Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out. lynne neagle am: They are in the annex to the paper, Si\u00e2n, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law. kirsty williams am: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system. kirsty williams am: Claire, am I explaining it okay? claire bennett: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'\u2014it was never what was intended. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, it's not going to be on the face of the Bill\u2014the mental health aspect, for example. You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying\u2014 kirsty williams am: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that\u2014. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process\u2014. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years\u2014I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again\u2014you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. kirsty williams am: Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee\u2014 kirsty williams am: We're assuming so. sian gwenllian am: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said? kirsty williams am: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. Many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger\u2014and in some cases exclusive\u2014focus on Christianity, as opposed to including other world religions and, indeed, non-religious views. There were people who thought that RE shouldn't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that RE was compulsory, people objected to that, on the other\u2014. Of those respondents that agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, or were neutral\u2014didn't express an opinion either way, but were neutral on the question\u2014the issues that they were bringing forward were: a need for learners, as they saw it, to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. So, they wanted RE to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions. They felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is, as you say, diverse with people of different views living in it. There is certainly a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum. So, those are the issues around religious education\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Can I just\u2014? Before you go on to the next section\u2014is there evidence that this was a co-ordinated lobby to present a particular view and what is your response going to be to this? Obviously, there are always going to be lobbies presenting particular viewpoints. Our role, as politicians, is to lead, obviously, isn't it? kirsty williams am: Yes. Claire, would you say that it was a co-ordinated response? claire bennett: It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue\u2014on this one and on relationships and sex education. And your response? kirsty williams am: And my response: well, clearly, Si\u00e2n, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum\u2014that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system\u2014how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that? kirsty williams am: Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. sian gwenllian am: \u2014actually implemented in September\u2014 kirsty williams am: In 2022. kirsty williams am: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David. hefin david am: Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton? kirsty williams am: I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap. And how do you respond, then\u2014? , it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils? kirsty williams am: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own.",
        " Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools. hefin david am: What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical. kirsty williams am: As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them. hefin david am: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'. kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. hefin david am: Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' kirsty williams am: Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems. hefin david am: It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that? kirsty williams am: Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014 hefin david am: Bridges have been built. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on. hefin david am: I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv. kirsty williams am: And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know. hefin david am: And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. steve davies: As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform. kirsty williams am: The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay. hefin david am: When did that take place? kirsty williams am: Where? hefin david am: When. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014 suzy davies am: This isn't about assessment. suzy davies am: So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales? kirsty williams am: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014 suzy davies am: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this. steve davies: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014? claire bennett: I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years. kirsty williams am: And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward. suzy davies am: Can I just have a quick\u2014? lynne neagle am: Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough? kirsty williams am: I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about \u00a324 million over two years. kirsty williams am: You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum. kirsty williams am: There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they're going to need. But we have worked with the National Academy for Educational Leadership to put together a programme for headteachers, and that's national. The regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants, and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics. Claire referred to the AoLE networks, and there's an opportunity then for people to engage in that. So, this September is the start of our new ITE courses, taught for the first time, and that's great. So, we're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support, again on a national basis, for those who are newly qualified, beginning their teaching career, because I don't think we've done that on a consistently good level across the country. We're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system. We're also involved in\u2014and I'm sure the committee has heard about it, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground\u2014schools as learning organisations and the OECD work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation. We know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong, strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system, and we've not been very good at that in Wales, we've not been strong at that, that's not the culture that we have had. We've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you're good or bad, rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about, 'What are we doing well and what do we need to improve on?' So, the schools as learning organisations are an important part, again, so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD. And the money that you announced for this\u00a0\u00a0professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues? Or do you see what you've put in as being, 'This is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation. The rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that'? kirsty williams am: The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning, and I'm sure this committee and, indeed, members of this committee could help me in that task. Can you tell us a bit about the innovation schools\u2014the 16 innovation schools\u2014and how you've made your decisions about who they might be, across which sectors, in primary, secondary and so on? So, basically, how they were selected and what you're expecting of them. So, all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which is innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us, going forward. I think one of the lessons learned, and this was said in the committee, was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools, but there was a downside to having pioneer schools, and I think, at this stage of the game, we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now\u2014everybody had to be a pioneer\u2014because this is coming down the track and we don't want anybody just sitting there waiting until September 2022 and saying, 'Oh, gosh. So, the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we've all got to engage in this now. The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement, and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out\u2014 claire bennett: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole\u2014so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice\u2014'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically. kirsty williams am: If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector\u2014secondary, primary\u2014but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly\u2014not exactly\u2014 but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?' lynne neagle am: Okay. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools. sian gwenllian am: Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools\u2014? I understand that they are discussing in clusters, and so on, but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now? steve davies: I can't tell you that, absolutely, 100 per cent are definitely, totally, absolutely equally involved. The structure we've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually\u2014not readiness to engage\u2014start to deliver as we move through to the future. And we don't have a roll-call against all schools, but we require them, or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks. Every school is part of a network that links to it, and they gauge (1) the level of activity in it, (2) the outcomes of that work, because each of the networks, each of the clusters, produces work that the region brings together. What I would say, and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to Scotland, I think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this, it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver. dawn bowden am: I just wanted to clarify, because in your paper you talk about giving \u00a330,000 to each, or to the innovation schools. Was that \u00a330,000 each, or \u00a330,000 for the project? kirsty williams am: Each school that participates in the innovation schools programme gets \u00a330,000. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. Well, you're right\u2014we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools.",
        " Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message\u2014 and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train\u2014that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. dawn bowden am: So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on. We've got a lot of issues to cover, so I'm going to appeal for concise questions, concise answers. What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals? lynne neagle am: Excellent, concise question. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment\u2014we refer to a formative and summative assessment\u2014and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. suzy davies am: Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be\u2014. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document\u2014is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming. suzy davies am: Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those? kirsty williams am: Oh, yes. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately? kirsty williams am: Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent\u2014I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes? kirsty williams am: To accountability? suzy davies am: Yes. Well, we're moving to a system of schools as learning organisations, and a greater emphasis on self-evaluation, with external verification of that by Estyn, our inspectors. suzy davies am: And that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well\u2014will those indicators change, do you think? kirsty williams am: Well, categorisation\u2014again, the purpose for categorisation is not to make a judgment on a school in the sense of a league table; it's a triage process, categorisation. kirsty williams am: Well, this is the issue, isn't it? This is the problem of designing a system where there are perfectly good reasons to introduce the system\u2014and in this case it's a triage system to identify levels of support for a school. And categorisation was never intended to be a way of expressing a league table of school performances; it's there to identify levels of support that a school can expect from its regional consortia. Now, we have, we have\u2014we will continue to keep categorisation, but, since coming into office, we have tried to adapt categorisation simply away from pure data to a more formative assessment process, and categorisation will continue to evolve. And the first level of accountability in that system has to be the professionalism of an individual member of staff\u2014the moral purpose that I bring to my classroom today to do right by the children that are in front of me. That's the first part of our accountability regime\u2014the moral purpose our professionals bring to their work. Well, just finally on that, there may be an argument, then, for scrapping categorisation, putting something else in place. But I suppose the core question is: how are the general public going to understand all those things that you've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach, the leaders being able to lead, and how well a school is performing against KPIs on those measures? kirsty williams am: Well, because we will still\u2014. kirsty williams am: Yes, that's the ultimate, isn't it? So, the ultimate is\u2014. The ultimate system that we're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in Estyn. Because I get the point of the end point being Estyn, and that's where the public assurance will be seen, but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards? Where will we see those demonstrated? kirsty williams am: Well, you would expect to see those demonstrated in the self-evaluation that a school will provide of itself, and then Estyn\u2014 suzy davies am: All right, so schools will be publishing self-evaluations annually, or something like that? kirsty williams am: Yes, schools\u2014 steve davies: The outcome of the self-evaluation is a school development plan. steve davies: We expect a series of priorities for a school to set itself as a result of prioritisation. What we're looking at, in terms of what's brought to that, is not a narrow set of measures\u2014just two measures, or one measure in a secondary school. The measures will still consider reflection on progress of children, but it'll also have reviews of mental health, well-being, how it approaches that and things that it wanted to do. The school is evaluating\u2014the outcome of that will be a development plan, annually published on the website. kirsty williams am: And the schools' ability\u2014whether they do that well or whether they don't do it well\u2014will be judged by Estyn. lynne neagle am: Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum. Qualifications Wales, which I met with yesterday, I think\u2014yes, yesterday; it seems a long time ago\u2014will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November. How is awareness and understanding of human rights, including children\u2019s rights, being embedded in the new curriculum? kirsty williams am: Children's rights, human rights\u2014they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner\u2019s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period. kirsty williams am: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded. sian gwenllian am: Turning to the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource? kirsty williams am: We have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum. It's one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we've had previously, where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications aren't available. So, we're already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools? kirsty williams am: Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have to support the Welsh dimension are really, really, really broad and not confined to specific areas. I was in Swansea University just this week, looking at some of their Technocamp work that they're doing to help us with coding, and we had an amazing conversation about the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. And so my expectation is that that isn't taught in a history lesson\u2014that, actually, when children are learning about coding, they get to hear that Welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology. When I talk about a Welsh dimension,  right the way across the curriculum, and I think that's important. The continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught. We have to recognise that, and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa\u2014we've had this discussion before\u2014if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position. So, we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it is a progression. sian gwenllian am: With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests? kirsty williams am: Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay, so it's the timing. sian gwenllian am: So, later on, maybe when this is embedded\u2014 kirsty williams am: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. kirsty williams am: There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD\u00a0and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally. sian gwenllian am: So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA. kirsty williams am: Oh gosh, that shows that Si\u00e2n thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this. janet finch-saunders am: Can you give a guarantee that all children and young people, where appropriate, will take part in physical activity under the new curriculum for Wales? Also, how much time per week will the Government expect children and young people to spend undertaking physical activity? kirsty williams am: Yes, all children will be given that opportunity, because if they are not then that school would be in breach of the expectations that will be set out in statute. janet finch-saunders am: How will you monitor it? kirsty williams am: Again, Janet, I don't go around monitoring schools now. As we've just said\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: How will you ensure that every child has that opportunity? kirsty williams am: Well, as we've just said, ultimately, we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia, nor are we getting rid of Estyn. So, one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that Estyn would make to a school. To what extent will the new curriculum allow for the continuity of the way that the foundation phase is taught? Will there be any significant differences and have the early years professionals been involved in the development of the curriculum to date? kirsty williams am: Yes, early years professionals have been involved in the curriculum to date. One of the advantages, I think, of the new curriculum is to take the pedagogical principles that underpin our approach to early years education actually further into children's educational journey. We have a certain pedagogical approach until the age of seven, and then all of a sudden, at seven, it's like, 'Forget all of that now. Sit down, pick up your pen and do this.' That's been really uncomfortable for many practitioners in our primary sector. So, actually, yes, statutory and non-statutory provision have been involved in the development of the curriculum because, of course, some of this is going to be delivered in the non-statutory sector. I'm very welcoming and supportive of that, but those pedagogical principles will now be available throughout that child's educational journey, rather than the false divide we've got at the moment. suzy davies am: So, aside from the purposes and the AoLEs, the type of teaching is unlikely to change in the foundation phase settings. The other end of the scale now: you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems don't just clash against each other. How are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there's a decent dovetail? kirsty williams am: Okay. We don't want to do anything in pre-16 that stops people going on to be successful in post-16, whichever route the child or young person decides to take. FE have been involved in every single AoLE and they're a part of the curriculum and assessment group. And then in the conversations we had yesterday with Qualifications Wales around what qualifications will look like, I was very keen to take the opportunity to emphasise that any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took. suzy davies am: And you're confident they're geared up to accepting young people who have been educated in this way. sian gwenllian am: I think you actually answered this at the beginning, but just to confirm that you're carrying on with the same governance set-up, the different groups that you've got, and there's nothing being added there or taken away. And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear? lynne neagle am: Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning. As Members will see, there are a substantial number of papers to note\u201423 in total, which are in a supplementary pack. As there are so many, can I suggest that we note them all together and then we've got an opportunity to return to some of them in the private session afterwards? Is that okay with everybody? Okay. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content?"

B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "grad a: So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ? phd f: sort of , I do , peripherally . phd c: Is that English ? phd f:  Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago phd d: That 's our system . grad a: Ugh ! phd f: and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that . grad a: C can I have a pen ? phd f:  Jane seems to be  moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . phd f: Yeah , so  , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers phd d: Speaking grad e: Which meetings is she transcribing ? phd f: and  well we 've we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are  , sort of awaiting to go to IBM . phd d: So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM grad e: So we 're doing some in parallel . phd d: Because I I need to ask Jane whether it 's it would be OK for her  , s some of her people to transcribe  some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . phd d:  and we want it You know , we need The Again , we we have a similar  logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich grad a: Right . phd d: And so  I wanted to ask Jane if if  , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could could do  since these are very short , that should really be  , professor b:   And it 's One session is only  like seven professor b: So that should have ma many fewer And it 's also not  a bunch of interruptions with people and all that , phd d: Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the the thing that they 're reading professor b: right ? So . phd d: And so  , I guess since she 's I was gonna ask her but since she 's not around I maybe I 'll professor b: Yeah , well it certainly seems phd d:  if if that 's OK with you to to , you know , get that stuff  to ask her for that , then I 'll do that . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I  ,  I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's phd d: Yeah . phd f: Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page  up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's grad a: Can you mail that out to the list ? phd f:  -  , yeah I will . I That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages grad a: Oh , OK , OK . phd f: and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I don't really think there 's much to talk about . professor b: You are going to grad a: I 'm gonna send out to the participants , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits .  phd c: So but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ? grad a: Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . phd f: So ,  the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and grad a: Oh , that 's a good point . Yeah , it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , it takes too long to do random access decompression . Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're  running out of the un - backed - up disk space on grad a: Well , that was the other point . phd f: Oh , was that another one ? grad a: Yep , that 's another agenda item . grad a: So ,  But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . I 've added some stuff that  indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID .  The back - end is  , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . So I think Don and I are gonna work on that and and you and I can just talk about it off - line more .  grad e: And , also  , I was just showing Andreas , I got  an X Waves kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom grad a: Oh , cool . grad e: so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it think it has potential for a little something , grad a: For a demo ? grad e: yeah , for a demo . grad e: So professor b: OK , so again , the issue is For July , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into a Windows machine , and so on , but grad e: Oh . grad e: Well , we 'll see ,  phd c: I 've been putting together  Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . phd d: Really ? So is that Because there 's some people  It would be cool if we could  get that to work  at at SRI phd c: Yeah . phd d: because the  grad a: Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack , phd d: we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the phd c: Yeah . Yeah but But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . But I just wrote an email to to the author of to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library grad a: Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ? phd c: and so it works . Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then the the new version is is totally different grad a: Oh . phd c: and you can't you can't access that so you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches . Ugh ! phd d: I I wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along phd c: Yeah . grad a: We have Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet . phd f: So did you  put the  the NT version out on the  Meeting Recorder page ? Or phd c: No , I haven't done that yet . professor b: So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this  , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the grad e: Yeah . phd c: So grad e: Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's phd d: So So Well grad e:  we could do it in Matl -  you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure . phd d: But But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . Again it 's it 's It 's more Tcl - T grad e: Yeah . grad a: So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it , phd d: Right . grad a: But it it seems to me that I c phd c: And grad a: It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . grad e:  What do you mean by real time ? Do you mean like phd f: Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo . phd f: Is that what you mean ? grad a: It just seems to me jus grad e: It would be cool to see it phd f: Yeah . grad e: It would be cool like to see to hear it and see it , phd c: And to hear it . grad a: Sure , but I don't think I You can do all that just statically in phd c: Yeah . grad e: I think it would lose Yeah ,  y grad a: Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's grad e: Right , right .  , no , we 're talking about on the computer and and  , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , grad e: Right . professor b: we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and , the more live , the better , but  , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . So I think For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it phd d:   But ,  Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , in to people . professor b: Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator ,  certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them . So , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . grad a: And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once , in a lot of different ways . grad a: Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , phd c: Yeah . grad a: so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do  , the permission forms , phd f:   grad a: so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred alright , excuse me ten ,  SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades . grad a: And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . phd f: Well , is there Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a grad a: Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott . phd f: You can put two phd d: Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the grad a: Sure . grad a: So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in . professor b: But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it , a second disk rack or something . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? phd c: Yep . professor b: Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , mightn't you ?  , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , grad a: Oh , I didn't know he had left already . grad e: How much space do you need for these ? professor b: I don't know what his schedule is . phd f: I I thi grad e: I have  I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . grad a: Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ? grad e: So  , Samosa . grad a: And you 're o you 're offering ? grad e:  I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything . grad e:  not that I can't do anything , I jus phd f: I I jus I just gave Thilo some about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on on  Abbott .  And  So but that But grad a: Which one was that , X G ? X G ? phd c: XG . phd d: That 's also where we store the The  Hub - five training set waveforms , phd c: Oops . grad a: But that won't be getting any bigger , phd d: right ? phd f: No . grad a: will it ? phd f: I don't think that 's on XG . phd d: But I 've also been storing I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are grad e: Well phd d: and we won't be using the old ones anymore . phd d:  Oh thats XA Oh that 's X phd c: Isn't that XH ? phd f: I th grad a: Not not for long . grad e: I have a lot of space and it 's not it 's n There 's very little  Yeah not for long . phd d: Maybe I 'm confu grad e: But  it 's not going f phd d: Oh no I 'm sorry . grad a: Yeah , it 's probably Probably only about four gig is on X on your X drive , phd c: So . grad a: but we 'll definitely take it up if you grad e: I th phd d: I think you 're right . It 's XH and D grad e: I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there , phd d: The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused . grad a: The \" more disk space \" button ? professor b: Just press Press each meeting saying \" we need more disk space \" \" this week \" . professor b: And And how much does each meeting take ? phd f: And it 's about a gig uncompressed . phd c: It 's It 's a little bit more as I usually don't do not uncompress the all of the PZM and the PDA things . So there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? professor b: So - so So maybe there 's a hundred gig or something . Well we We haven't uncompressed all the meetings , but grad a: I would like to .  it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , grad a: Yep . professor b: but But  , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for if we could get some disk . phd f: I s I sent this out a a day ago grad a: And put it where ? professor b: Right . phd f: but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know how the whole process works .  does he just go out and get them and if it 's OK , and grad a: Yep . And just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was \" are you sure you just want one ? \" So  I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure \" well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \" . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , phd d: Th - The phd f: I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now . phd d: One One On - One thing to in to  t to do when you need to conserve space is phd f: So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . phd d: I bet there are still some old , like , nine gig disks , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and and you know recover the space . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is  the back the back up system , rather than on new disk . Basically , we can easily get one to four disks ,  you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal .  , but the question is where they go , and I don't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him . grad a: Yeah , it 's just It 's not on the net , so it 's a little awkward phd d: The only phd f:  . phd d: What do you mean it 's not on the net ? grad a: It 's not phd c: It 's not bad . grad a: It 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except S S phd d: Oh because it 's because it 's an ACIRI machine ? grad a: Yep . grad a: And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but Who knows when that will happen ? phd d: But that can't be that hard . phd d:  grad a: No , the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's it 's jus every ever everybody everybody has a has grad a: But Dave has to do all of them . But at any rate I think that there 's a there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a a conversation with  , maybe maybe after after tea or something you and I can go down and and talk to him about it Just say \" wha you know , what should we do right now ? \" phd f: How long is David gonna be gone ? professor b: eleven days or something ? grad a: Oh my ! professor b: Yeah basically tomorrow and all of the week after . The only oth thing other thing I was gonna add was that   , I talked briefly to Mari and  we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . And I I I wanted to make it ,  after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wanna do next meeting is is  to put together  , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , that we 've done .",
        "  just sort of bulletize  o e do do I can I can dream up text but this is basically gonna lead to the annual report . grad a: This is the fifteenth ? So just a week from tomorrow ? professor b: that would grad a: OK . So , we can This So that 's an phd d: Is this gotta be in the morning ? professor b:  phd d: Or Because you know I Fridays I have to leave  like around  two . So if it could be before that would be be professor b: No , no but I I I don't need other folks for the meeting . professor b: Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting if I wa something I I I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . professor b: but but   , and then the next day  , late in the day I 'll be having that that discussion with her . phd d:   One thing  we in past meetings we had  also a you know various variously talked about the  work that w  was happening sort of on the on the recognition side professor b:   And I wondered whether we should maybe have  a separate meeting and between you know , whoever 's interested in that because I feel that  there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of  maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if  professor b: Think so ? phd d: Well , it 's that It 's just gonna be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . professor b: Well , OK , so how many how many people here would not be interested in  in a meeting about recognition ? phd c: Me too . phd d: Well I know Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this grad a: No . professor b: Real grad e: Watch a ball game ? professor b: Yeah , real real real men \" Real men do decoding \" or something like that . phd d:  it it 's sort of  when when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've you know , I I 'm bored . grad a: The Nod off ? phd d: So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to i to to be  you know If I cou you know this could professor b: It 's cuz y you have a So you need a better developed feminine side . phd d: I 'm professor b: There 's probably gonna be a lot of \" bleeps \" in this meeting . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we phd f: Right , I was Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ? grad a: Or just alternate the focus . grad a: Oh sor phd f: But I do I don't  a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . phd f: So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting grad a: Let 's read digits and go . professor b: And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane when we get a chance , see what they think and phd d:   phd f: and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd you know , where do we go from here kind of things and So , it would be good . professor b: Yeah , and you 're you 're attending the  the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . phd d:  I jus So the latest result was that   yot I tested the  the sort of final version of the PLP configuration  on development test data for for this year 's Hub - five test set . phd d: And the recognition performance was exactly , and  exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the  Mel Cepstra front - end .  , well i there was a little bit of a phd f: Oh ! phd d: i overall . phd d: And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement . phd d: Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm ,  c combine that . professor b: So except  the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation . phd d: And , the phd f: But a percent and a half ? grad a: Yeah , it 's pretty impressive . phd f: That 's phd d: And And so  after I told the my  colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , have a Next time we have an evaluation they want to do  , you know , basically a at least the system combination .  , and , you know , why not ? professor b: Sure , why not ? phd d:  . phd d:  w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ? grad a: No ,  front - end features . Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and phd d: Oh  Yeah . That 's the the the There 's one thing   you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end You know , if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems phd f: Oh . So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless  thing . phd f: Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half  phd d: I I think so . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .  Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely . phd d: And then we had some results on digits , with  We We So this was  really really sort of just to get Dave going with his  experiments . But as a result , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits . phd d: And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set . phd d: And you c And Not all of No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it . professor b: A fifth of it is how much ? phd d: The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and  ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that . But a fi a fifth is how much ? phd d: A fifth would be maybe  two hours something . professor b: Yeah , so  that 's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was . phd d: But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there professor b: Oh yeah phd d: because we 're doing professor b: w phd d: You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti  TIMIT  not TIMIT  TI - digits , professor b:   phd d: That 's e professor b: Because because  , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better , phd d: That was e Right , right . So we only for the Hub - five training , we 're only using  a fairly small subset of the Macrophone database . grad a: I could also put in  focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech . So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use  something other than TI - digits . They they  they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests phd d:   professor b: But but yeah certainly if we ,  If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . professor b: Once we know , then the trainable parts of it it 'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem  system and You wanna You wanna see where that stands ? phd f: Well , I 'm phd d:  phd f: Yeah , so Andreas  brought over the  alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of  converting those alignments into  label files that we can use to train  a new net with . phd d: An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's  that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight phd f: Right . phd d:  which is smaller than the  than the phone set that that we 've been using so far . phd d: And that that that will probably help , actually , phd f: So it 's a little different ? phd d: because  the fewer dimensions  e the less trouble probably with the as far as just the  ,  Just You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view . Although we  , it 's not that many fewer and and and we take a KLT anyway so we could phd d: Right . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe  something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard  front - end . So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little  he didn't lose very much . phd d: But then And then something Once we have the new M L P trained up ,  one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run  like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features  and  retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system . professor b: And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system . phd d:  because you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then  tra retraining it on Switchboard or s  and professor b: Yeah . phd d: But he I think he d he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available . We we made some improvements to the dictionary 's  to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a  something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard , which professor b: Well the other thing is , dipping deep into history and into  our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before , phd d:   professor b:  it was I think , it is was a really key  starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . professor b: When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher ,  at the time . Later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems phd f: Yeah . professor b: cuz they were self consistent but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error  rate . professor b: And we 're not quite that bad with our our Switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as SRI 's , phd d: OK . phd f: W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? Roughly ? professor b: Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error . And  it was I think there 's just a whole lot of things that  no one ever had time for .  we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did . professor b: we never did an never did any adaptation phd d: But that w Even that that number professor b: we never did any phd d: Right . And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ? Where the error rate now is in the twenties . phd d: So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re  professor b: Yeah . And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . phd d: So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs before we go ahead and train up the  you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system . Not phd f: Should we Should we bother with  using the net before doing  embedded training ? professor b: But . phd d: But phd f:  should should we even use that ? phd d: Oh oh that 's a good question . phd f: Or should I just go straight to phd d: Yeah , we we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments  from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign . You run it ? Keep keep both versions ? See which one 's better ? professor b: yeah . professor b: And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did . You know , it 's phd d: But But so I grad a: Sort of given up guessing . phd d: Well but i But in your experience   have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish  improvements that you got professor b:  well . professor b: because we 're coming from  , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system . grad a: Although ,  we 've done it with When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse . phd d: So you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge  system ? grad a: Yep . professor b: Oh ! phd d: No  it 's weird that it did I 'm sorry . Tha - u we we 've see  and wi with the numbers OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better . phd d: Oh actually it 's not that weird because we have seen We have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better . professor b: But I But I would I would suspect that something that that had  a very different  feature set , for instance  they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us . professor b: I I would expect that something that had a different feature set would would  benefit from phd d:   professor b: sorry , it was the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors . professor b: So  , that 's another pretty big difference grad a: That 's another big difference . professor b: and  , one bac at least Back at phd d: You mean with soft targets ? Or ? Sorry , I 'm sor I missed What What 's the key issue here ? professor b: Oh , that  both the Cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors . And if we 're we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different different  , training criterion  , I would think that in a that an embedded  embedded  training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more . I was wondering  you know what size net I should Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ? professor b: how much training data ? phd f: Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set . professor b: And how How many hours is that ? phd f: That 's why I was I I 'm not sure how much that is . phd d: I think that has about Well i you 'd would be gender - dependent training , right ? So So I think it 's  that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours . phd f: In the small training set ? grad a: Hello ? phd d: I I think so . I 'll grad a: Excuse me ? phd d: It 's definitely less than a hundred grad a: Alright . It 's it 's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more phd d:   It 's m It 's more than phd f: And a thousand is too small ? professor b: Oh let me think about it , but I think that that  th at some point there 's diminishing returns . professor b: but it but but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling the amount of time . phd d: Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gonna be fewer parameters there . phd d: And then professor b: Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ? grad a: Vast majority is from the input unit . grad a: Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger . professor b: Yeah , so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference . What am I trying to think of ? phd f: The The net that that we did use already  was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up . professor b: So , yeah definitely not the one thousand  two thousand fr  the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good .  a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so phd d: Right "

        " hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .  I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . project manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? user interface: Yes , I think so .  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . I just sent user interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , project manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , user interface: yeah . project manager:  and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . So I would say industrial designer: You said  targ target groups , project manager: yeah ? industrial designer: what does that mean ? project manager: As  who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , user interface:  industrial designer:  okay , 'kay . industrial designer: So are project manager: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on industrial designer: Okay .  so f from the project manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , user interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . So n  with  with regard to the  working design of this   remote control  I've identified  a few basic  components of the remote and  se  from the design , functional design perspective  w I c we can now  know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .  the identification of the components ,  and  since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person  and  from the user interface person . industrial designer: and  basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  so basically  the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  and what are the different processes  and how the parts  communicate with each other .  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .  also  the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features  makes it more comp complex . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing  with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .  also the management wants that  our design should be unique  it so it should incorporate  colour and the slogan  that our company  has it as its standard . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . So if  if this is our energy source and this is a cell ,  it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h  how how to do everything . So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,  which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .  so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do ,  make the chip more complicated  and bigger , basically .  so i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . And  also if we can incorporate  the latest features in our chip design , so that our   remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most  televisions . project manager: Do you have any  i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer: but  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so  I just identified the functional components for that . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some  design issues then I I I would like to continue project manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? user interface: okay , yeah . project manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . project manager: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you user interface: There's just nothing . project manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , user interface: Oh right , right , right ,  project manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . project manager: Now it's coming , industrial designer: It'll come up , it   no signal . user interface: No signal ? Why ? project manager: Maybe again ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now , user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again user interface: This is the problem , but project manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design  just like some some first issues that came up .  'kay , so the method I was  adopting at this point , it's not  for the for the whole  period of the  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . user interface:   my method was  to look at  other  remote controls ,  so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what  functionality they used . And then  after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web  just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what  what the user might desire as additional  functionalities . user interface:  so the findings  were  that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And  w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,  then the user would like to switch the channel  for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then   the other possibility would be that  she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .   I als industrial designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? user interface: okay .   among the findings I found that m m most of the curr  presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities  in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update  actually  we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . industrial designer: user interface: So my personal preferences would be  to keep the  the whole remote control small  just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions  like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .  then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then  other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then ,  for example brightness and  similar functions could be just  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n  more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . user interface: If you have questions project manager: If  that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . user interface: Yeah , and also it's it's  other question is  because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included marketing: project manager: user interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the   video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . industrial designer: project manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? industrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements    we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .  but  so so at this stage ,  how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  in we can completely do away with buttons and  have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But  is is there any   any thoughts on that ? user interface:  well , I think the buttons are still  kind of the most  easy for the user to use , industrial designer: Right . user interface:   what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user industrial designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . user interface: and and  the user just wants to get  get a result  quickly , not to spend time in like  giving several orders  I dunno . user interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other  proposals  . industrial designer:  I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . industrial designer:  i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: try to press project manager: Is it plugged in prop industrial designer: oh , okay , marketing: It's working . marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab  observed remote control use with  a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .  so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and  the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . project manager: marketing:  current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .  I dunno what zapping is , but project manager: It's  switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .  okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , industrial designer: Right .  but project manager: I liked the , I liked the litt marketing: ooh where's it go ? project manager: ooh come back . marketing:  okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . project manager: - , that's the next one along , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like  their importance , you know , project manager: marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , industrial designer: marketing:  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  that they get lost , that the  you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . marketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from  you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , project manager: The remote control . Okay , so   the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages industrial designer: Right . marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . Right ,  sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .  so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but  you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and  , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .  there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . marketing:  okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and  , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . industrial designer: marketing:  and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or industrial designer:  . marketing: not a mobile phone industrial designer: Some kind of a ring , project manager: Keys and things like that , industrial designer: some marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , industrial designer: Right . marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , project manager: marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . I think one of the very interesting things that came up in   Ka Kate Cat Cat's  presentation was   this this issue of   like voice recognition being more popular with  younger people . industrial designer: So if we need to have a target group  then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and  you know , good looking  we are better off targeting a younger audience then  you know , people who are comparatively elderly . marketing: Yeah ,  that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then  th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager: project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer: Right , and project manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . marketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know project manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah , project manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface: you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer: But  still , if if you can go back to that slide and  , how popular was it ? project manager: O oh it's on marketing: Oh , I've unplugged it . marketing: Do you want me to project manager: Here , let me industrial designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh   people between twenty five to thirty five ,  how popular was marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I kn  I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like  , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , project manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and marketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: you don't normally have a car , project manager: usually not a car and all of those things . industrial designer: So you're more likely to b marketing: so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing: No ,  that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , project manager: user interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full project manager: Yeah . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , project manager: But do they user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah user interface: Common , the students yeah , yeah . user interface: yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , industrial designer:  user interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ . marketing: industrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? project manager: marketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . user interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of   marketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . marketing: You know , so  that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . user interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer:  project manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on  m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p  things that Cat pointed out was   how do we go about implementing it ?  and  project manager: marketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like  every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , user interface: An industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , project manager:  . marketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know industrial designer: project manager: marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement  for for a limited user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface: Yeah but   Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager: Yeah , user interface: and  , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: What  user interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this  separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular  in the sense that  a person can say , I want to watch  I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . industrial designer: Yeah , so if  if something like that can be incorporated , marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . industrial designer: some kind of marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . marketing: Yeah , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: and that would be really annoying . user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just  speak into it project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager: So that you can yell at it , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think   the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer:  yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager:  . user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and  not to yell at it from the distance . So  wh another thing  that can be used is that  there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so you can go and press that button and  and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , project manager: project manager: but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , user interface: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface: The major ones , yeah . project manager:  but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning  . project manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break industrial designer: project manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . project manager:  I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . industrial designer: So where exactly is this i project manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . user interface: Did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah in that one , user interface: It's just yeah , yeah . marketing: Oh , so y you want our  PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager: Yeah , that would be great . user interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , project manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . project manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . project manager:  as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . marketing: project manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface:  something conceptual , yeah . project manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that marketing: project manager:  we'll keep keep our options op  ? industrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . user interface: Sorry , but  the next meeting  are we going to have it  right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . project manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . project manager: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? marketing: user interface: Okay , see you ."

        "We've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan, and I'm very pleased to welcome David Rees, who is substituting for her today. Item 2 this morning, then, is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government's childcare offer. So, I'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, Minister for Children and Social Care, also Jo-Anne Daniels, director for communities and tackling poverty, and Owain Lloyd, deputy director for childcare, play and early years. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions come from Hefin David. How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag? huw irranca-davies am: It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding\u2014we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the\u00a0seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one\u2014that's in Blaenau Gwent. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out. hefin david am: What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that? huw irranca-davies am: It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have\u2014and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler. hefin david am: How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020? huw irranca-davies am: We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out\u00a0to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within\u00a0densely urban areas,\u00a0where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer.\u00a0Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we\u00a0have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020. hefin david am: Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for\u00a0the services is not spread evenly across? huw irranca-davies am: Absolutely. hefin david am: And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales? huw irranca-davies am: No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that\u00a0there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. We're not finding a problem here\u00a0with capacity,\u00a0whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision,\u00a0whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding\u00a0that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of\u00a0the well-known ones\u2014and I've spoken\u00a0about\u00a0this before\u2014is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a\u00a0family tradition of doing childcare\u00a0within\u00a0the families. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered,\u00a0unlicensed childcare of a sort. So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing\u00a0alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we\u00a0learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with\u00a0parents and providers and local authorities as well. It's about communicating what the offer is, how\u00a0simple it is to get invovled in this and\u00a0where they go to, and, critically, I think, how we do that national roll-out would be important as well. hefin david am: So, given the point you've made about\u00a0grandparents and family, wouldn't it be sensible, then, to offer a subsidy to\u00a0grandparents to provide this kind of care? huw irranca-davies am: Unregistered grandparents? hefin david am: Well, through some kind of analysis of that. huw irranca-davies am: Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this. hefin david am: Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as\u00a0carers for their own family member? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that\u00a0registration as well. The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects\u00a0that come\u00a0with this.\u00a0This childcare offer ties into\u00a0the foundation years offer. There's an element of education linked to the\u00a0childcare offer\u2014there's that 10\u00a0hours of the early education foundation years as well. So, there's an issue here with quality, about socialisation and how children learn in an environment, as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding. So, the\u00a0focus of this scheme is very much on registered\u00a0licensed providers, which could be, by the way\u2014because we do have them, and we're discussing this at the moment internally and with the\u00a0Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years\u00a0and others\u2014grandparents\u00a0who are actually registered and\u00a0inspected by the care inspectorate? We're having\u00a0those discussions. hefin david am: How many of them are there? huw irranca-davies am: We don't think there is a huge number, but we're trying to\u00a0bottom this out at the moment. We haven't got\u00a0the exact number, but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other\u00a0people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's\u00a0registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well\u00a0because we also get\u00a0people who will say to us, 'I don't\u00a0want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look after my grandchildren\u00a0because I look after them'. hefin david am: And what about the view, given that you said that\u00a0capacity\u00a0wasn't an issue, of the National Day Nurseries\u00a0Association, which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain? huw irranca-davies am: I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an\u00a0opportunity to make it more\u00a0resilient and more robust. We know from the\u00a0early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity\u00a0within the childcare sector, and we're talking about\u00a0everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children,\u00a0to large, complex environments that perhaps\u00a0are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation. So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer. What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by \u00a360 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare\u2014and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well\u2014that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because\u00a0in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff. hefin david am: That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, I think it is, absolutely, because, again, what we're finding is we've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development\u00a0of this roll-out. One is the work that we're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out, so we're literally learning live time, and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going, but also there is a termly update as well. We've also commissioned additional work from\u00a0Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we've done to see what that tells us as well. But the feedback that we're getting from the childcare providers themselves, on the basis that we're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are, is that, 'Yes, we can do this', because\u00a0we're putting the money in, we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales. It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden\u2014flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.' So, let me give you one key example. Alongside this, alongside\u00a0the \u00a360 million capital fund, alongside\u00a0the workforce development, we've also identified a separate\u00a0strain of money into cylch meithrin. We're specifically putting money into developing that, and, in fact, the first one of those will be, from\u00a0that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September. They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Thirty. huw irranca-davies am: It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years\u00a0after that.\u00a0We can't take this for granted, Hefin. hefin david am: The last thing from me: the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because\u00a0of the add-ons? huw irranca-davies am: We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities. The\u00a0first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity\u00a0and confusion. hefin david am: Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps\u00a0in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff? huw irranca-davies am: No, because\u00a0we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point. But will it be, then? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, it will be. Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them. But, as I say\u2014 hefin david am: But do you anticipate\u00a0a capacity\u00a0problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas, compared to, say, the Cynon valley? huw irranca-davies am: We can't anticipate\u00a0it yet,\u00a0Hefin, but that's exactly the reason\u00a0for going into that area and then assessing how it works. We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount. But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach. So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it's appropriate. You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50, because\u00a0the \u00a34.50 doesn't cover everything.\u00a0The \u00a34.50 is a contribution\u00a0towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this. Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are. I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.\u00a0One: parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different. Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now\u2014'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on. hefin david am: That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't. Isn't that a concern? huw irranca-davies am: If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well. The fact that parents, including those who are on lower incomes, are used to currently discriminating between providers, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'\u2014 hefin david am: That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it? huw irranca-davies am: In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'You can do what you want'\u2014I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions. But\u00a0within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, \"Within that we provide everything\"; you may be with a provider that says, \"Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost\u2014\".' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily\u00a0disadvantage. In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges? Well, possibly you would. But we work within the realistic\u2014 hefin david am: Or have a lower top-end income limit. huw irranca-davies am: Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee, there's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted. For the moment, I think there is an attraction, in terms of the upper limit, of saying: one\u2014'Let's try not to add additional complexity, let's go with a scheme that's already working its way through the system, which is, if you like, what they're doing in England, and not add additional complexity. But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents\u2014and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying, 'Well, let's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355.' There's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity. darren millar am: Just to ask, the labour market costs are changing, aren't they? You've got the national living wage increasing\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that's going to have a bearing, isn't it, on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the \u00a34.50 per hour regime? By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example. Do you have plans to review that? Where is it headed? Because it's certainly not going to be enough in the future. huw irranca-davies am: It depends how far in the future you're looking. I have to say, the feedback that we're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable\u00a0future of rolling this out. darren millar am: But they've raised concerns about the national living\u00a0wage implications, haven't they, as well? huw irranca-davies am: Of course, and I think it's incumbent on us as well to not\u2014 darren millar am: So, it's not fair to say that they haven't raised concerns about the rate. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but what they're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised. darren millar am: But they have suggested that in meetings\u2014 huw irranca-davies am: That in future\u2014 darren millar am: Absolutely. huw irranca-davies am: Well, of course, in future, any Minister, any committee, will want to come back and look at\u2014is the hourly rate, as one element of the scheme, appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector, and not least, by the way, as we try not only to develop the workforce, but to develop the career pathways through this as well? And I think that's the right discussion to be had, live time, as this is taken forward. But at this moment in time, we're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount. darren millar am: So, have you forecasted\u00a0for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project? Because\u00a0you've still got this \u00a3100 million price tag on it, haven't you? huw irranca-davies am: Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport, if we identify that the rate is not appropriate, if it's\u2014. I don't think anybody's going to come back to us and say that it's too little. But do bear in mind that it's above where the average England rate is, even though there's this complex variability\u00a0within the English\u00a0rate that has caused some confusion there, which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed. If we find, as we pilot it, or if we find because\u00a0there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in, there needs to be adjustment, then we'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case. darren millar am: But that won't put the project at risk in terms of its finances? huw irranca-davies am: No, no.",
        " We are still very confident, looking forward, on the best projections we have, fed by the live input that's coming in from the pilot, which will be fed again in the autumn\u2014the Arad\u00a0report coming forward\u2014that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this\u2014challenging as this is, we have the capacity to deliver it\u2014but also that the funding that's available, on our best estimate\u2014the estimate we've stood by, that broad ball park of that \u00a3100 million figure\u2014it's deliverable within that. And if it changes, I'll have to be sitting down with my boss, Vaughan Gething, and with Mark Drakeford, to argue the case on it. But that rate, combined with the other elements of this childcare offer\u2014there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out. mark reckless am: Minister, as a parent who's been researching childcare options, it's obvious to me that in Cardiff, and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire, costs are substantially higher than this, and I haven't\u00a0been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for \u00a327, which is implied by your rate. Isn't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you're going to need a higher rate to make it work? Isn't that already obvious? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future? huw irranca-davies am: Chair, my biggest fear is a parent who's actually involved in this area already, but, having been one myself\u2014. Mark, you may be right, that's exactly why we're piloting it and that's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport, we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability\u00a0and the \u00a34.50 per hour rate. mark reckless am: But you're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I've referred to. mark reckless am: When are you starting? huw irranca-davies am: Cardiff and Newport\u2014September. The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding\u00a0the cultural and the economic impacts. So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision. But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it. And do you know, you may be right? And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within\u00a0those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee. lynne neagle am: Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable\u00a0items, your paper says that providers can charge up to \u00a37.50 a day for food, snacks, transport and consumables such as nappies. Now, that's \u00a337.50 a week, which is a lot of money for parents, and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure?\u00a0But also, do you think there's a risk\u00a0that providers who maybe aren't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme? huw irranca-davies am: I think they're the right areas to flag up, and if I thought that was going to happen I'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme. I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening. We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families. I think also, by the way, that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here. It's not in their interests, I have to say, as the umbrella bodies or individual providers, to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families. But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales. That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons. So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that. john griffiths am: I want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate? huw irranca-davies am: This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well. This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time. I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have. Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well. Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate. That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it. I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay? But, it's that open dialogue with the sector that says, 'There's one thing about what you're saying you demand as a market; there's another thing about what we're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers' money to actually put into this'. They also understand, John, that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we're seeing the evidence, by the way; I can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work, increase their hours and so on, this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales. The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity, including, by the way, not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations, such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved\u00a0in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well. So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with \u00a34.50.' lynne neagle am: David, you had a question on the pilots. Before I go to my question, I want to come back to Mark Reckless's question and the answer you gave. I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate. Is that also on the cards? huw irranca-davies am: David, it's possible. I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's\u2014. One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision. If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it. We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there. If I can now remind you: I don't remember the word 'affordability' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government. In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity. There's clearly a need to get more staff, because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment. Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well? Because there's a clear need to look at it. Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out? huw irranca-davies am: I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open. We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector, across the local authorities. Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities\u2014all of this. The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced. So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward. As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are. david rees am: What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward? huw irranca-davies am: Well, it's precisely that. So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are. Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints. But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out. And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out. We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision. It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any\u00a0fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another. So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that: where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it? If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that? So, we're doing that at the moment. I mentioned we've put the \u00a31 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years, targeting\u00a040 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021, which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this. So, all of those things, David, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place. david rees am: But in particular, take the Welsh language\u2014I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time\u2014but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas. When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically. They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. Have you been able to assess the actual impact, properly, upon the Welsh-medium side of things? Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly. We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision\u2014meithrin and so on\u2014but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive. So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer. They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision. And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located. This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas. lynne neagle am: I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question. llyr gruffydd am: I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may. A question from me though, the wider question, is: how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare? Because, clearly, leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it, but there's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium. So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that\u2014that there is a challenge there. Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector. So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost. But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'? huw irranca-davies am: Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours. Some, by the way, Llyr,\u00a0I have to say\u2014and, again, these are real-life situations\u2014are saying, 'What we're doing is not expanding our hours, but, because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer, we are now able to actually spend more time with our children, because we're adjusting our hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer.'\u00a0That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples\u2014I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong. huw irranca-davies am: But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October\u2014we're hoping to see the final report in October\u2014will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to \u00a3250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit their work life, but also to suit their families. llyr gruffydd am: So, in effect, you are saying that the PPIW\u00a0report got it wrong, basically. huw irranca-davies am: No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment\u2014maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad\u00a0report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.' llyr gruffydd am: But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story. huw irranca-davies am: We know, and we are constantly told\u2014I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well\u2014by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them. I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more. It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer. So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report. It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through. As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding. We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, \"Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well.\"' llyr gruffydd am: Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales. I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera. huw irranca-davies am: We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work\u00a0that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate\u2014do some appropriate benchmarking.",
        " What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand. But we will do some work, Llyr, around benchmarking against good comparative international examples, where appropriate. llyr gruffydd am: Yes, there we are, because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples. We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because\u00a0this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed. There is a direct outcome\u00a0there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.' llyr gruffydd am: Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address. Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life. I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy. Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind? huw irranca-davies am: I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now. It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there\u00a0are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability. But it isn't the offer that we took forward into Government; this is what we're taking forward. I'd say two significant things on it: one is, this doesn't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare. Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody. But before that, particularly for those disadvantaged families, before we even get to that stage, you have schemes such as Flying Start, and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere. If I had all the money under the sun, I would really do that, Chair; I would really do it. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but the fact that Flying Start, we know, is leading to those outcomes where those children, in quite challenged circumstances very often, are more ready to step up to the foundation year, are more ready, then, to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together. So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare. That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents. In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare. Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.' llyr gruffydd am: The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, indeed. llyr gruffydd am: So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here? huw irranca-davies am: Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different\u00a0forms. It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work. So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. If you look at the support for the children, we've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education, but we've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation, education and so on and so forth. If you look at this solely on its own and say, 'Well, there is nothing else there;\u00a0the rest of Wales is a desert and there's no support for parents, for getting parents back into work or for\u00a0those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education',\u00a0I'd be worried. But, actually, this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales, where I think we are well ahead of the other nations. Yes, we could do more, and I always say, Llyr; I always say, Chair, that if I had\u2014I don't have a chequebook at all, because it's not in my gift\u2014if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't. But what we can do is get the right schemes in place, and if this helps drive more choices for working parents, including, by the way\u2014.\u00a0There are niceties within this as well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working. darren millar am: I am surprised by the answer there,\u00a0particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old. Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that. If I can just very quickly ask you: has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week? So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there? huw irranca-davies am: Darren, we have considered it, and we haven't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work, not into training to enable them to get into work. There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth, but it's not this scheme. darren millar am: But it's not prescribed support, is it? You know, it's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier. You must have done some costings, then, if you've considered it, and you must have tried to identify numbers. huw irranca-davies am: We haven't\u2014 darren millar am: So, you haven't considered it that much, have you? huw irranca-davies am: We have actually considered\u2014. We consider it from the point of, 'What is this scheme set up to do?' It's very clear. But, very specifically, when you say you've considered it, what you mean is you thought about it but you've not costed it, you've not identified the numbers that might be involved\u2014 huw irranca-davies am: Absolutely, absolutely. darren millar am: And therefore you've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet. huw irranca-davies am: No, Darren, you're right: we haven't considered affordability because we've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do. It doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings? darren millar am: Perhaps I can frame my question in another way. Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost? huw irranca-davies am: Ah, right, okay.\u00a0We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the\u00a0scheme is designed to do. Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?\u00a0I drew attention in my answer to Llyr\u00a0to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.\u00a0In Gwynedd,\u00a0one of our pilot areas, they\u00a0are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. It is not the case, as you've suggested then, that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families. What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision, and that's\u00a0the way we want to see it work. So, I wouldn't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families. Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.\u00a0All families will qualify for the 10 hours\u00a0of education. In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer\u2014 darren millar am: But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. huw irranca-davies am: But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start\u2014 darren millar am: But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family\u2014 darren millar am: If they're in a Flying Start area. huw irranca-davies am: \u2014or they can be in a children's zone area or they can\u2014 darren millar am: If they're in those areas. lynne neagle am: Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please. In terms of child development and how this fits with wider\u00a0Welsh Government strategy, Huw,\u00a0I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.\u00a0We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government. I just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place. huw irranca-davies am: John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that: I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but\u00a0what they were doing was\u2014. Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014. So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that. Now, that is the model we need to see, and the \u00a34.50 seems to work, at the moment, for that. But the quality, I think, is key, and that's why we're focused very much on registered inspected providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet. john griffiths am: If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate. huw irranca-davies am: Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant\u2014. It's interesting that we focus on whether the \u00a34.50 is affordable, but the \u00a34.50\u2014you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that \u00a34.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous. So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff? Now, we're doing some fascinating work that I think I've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely. Now, this is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that. How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development? It's not simply childcare. mark reckless am: In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often don't make that up, even as they go through school. What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage? huw irranca-davies am: I'm looking to my colleagues here and\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer. Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born,\u00a0but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether\u2014. There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children. That's the compulsory school\u2014 jo-anne daniels: Well, that's the legal position, but, obviously, in practice, most children will start school in the term after they're four. mark reckless am: So, given the disadvantage we know that the younger children born in the summer have, relative to the older ones, why accentuate that by giving the older kids five terms of this project, which you tell us will have such positive effects on their child development, but the summer kids only get three? Doesn't\u00a0that make the situation worse? jo-anne daniels: I'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question. So, children will stop being in receipt\u00a0of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place, and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday. mark reckless am: But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school, where the younger kids, who're already disadvantaged, become eligible for it only three terms before, accentuating the problem, surely. Could more thought be given to this issue? huw irranca-davies am: We'll take that away. Minister, you got, or Welsh Government, really, got the Public Policy Institute for Wales to study this proposed policy and they concluded that it would have no substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children, and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small. What do you say to that? huw irranca-davies am: Well, Mark, I can only refer to what\u00a0I said earlier. Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income\u2014as I mentioned earlier, up to \u00a3250 per week within some poorer households; so, real-life examples\u2014but also where it's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there's more childcare offer available, or, alternatively, to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children, which they currently can't do. lynne neagle am: And I don't want to go back over Llyr's questions. They said if you had a work requirement, as you do, it would cost \u00a361 million a year on their numbers, substantially less than you're saying, and then they said it would cost \u00a3144 million without a work requirement. Now, that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents wouldn't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement. , are those numbers really credible from PPIW? huw irranca-davies am: It's not quite comparing like with like. Just to draw your attention, Mark, and the committee's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks. And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks\u2014beyond the term time and so on\u2014carries advantages that are not picked up in that report. mark reckless am: And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive? huw irranca-davies am: I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of \u00a326,000 in Wales\u2014 it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. mark reckless am: And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government\u00a0offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK? huw irranca-davies am: Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England\u2014the tax offer is more integrated\u2014has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every\u2014 mark reckless am: I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project\u2014people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by. mark reckless am: So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria\u2014you have a \u00a3100,000 cap, as well as the \u00a36,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC\u2014will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the \u00a37.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen? huw irranca-davies am: Yes, absolutely. owain lloyd: Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. So, if Members are content, I'd suggest that we note all of them in a block, if that's okay. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Okay"

So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach "

        " I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment .  I know each of you have a presentation and  in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes ,  each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some  decision on what functions it will have .  and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch ,  and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . I opened the meeting , the product was developed  and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it .  and it had some implications ,  the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'Kay . industrial designer:  I think so , project manager: Did I miss something ? industrial designer: we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: and we did a little bit of  team building of  of making the pictures , marketing: Okay , I accept the minutes . One of the the biggest issues I found about  from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these  remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible  useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So  my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools .  some of the research  in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and  that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the  recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And  in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the  will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool .  fifty percent I think of all these  numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of  television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . industrial designer: Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've marketing:  it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . project manager: Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be industrial designer: project manager: and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_  with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction  brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't  advertise for the I go everywhere line . marketing: Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and  luck lucky for us have the  cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this  if and you know , the the designers , project manager:  . marketing: but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five project manager: Is that a large enough target market to target it ? marketing: Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target .  s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and  with the technologies improving , if we can get these  project manager: In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? marketing: Yeah . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an project manager:  . industrial designer:  marketing: I don't know if speech recognition should be  should be included , project manager:  . marketing: but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about  being open to technology . user interface:  it definitely needs  a lot more research marketing: Shall I go back ? user interface: on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , marketing: Yeah , yeah . industrial designer: How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty ,  is that a lot or a little ? marketing: Exactly .  I I I  did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because  there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but  some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something  perhaps you all have seen  the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a  a small tray . marketing: You know , project manager: marketing: it's I a and I think , you know industrial designer: He must be w one of a s small population . But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and  they'll be project manager: But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , marketing:  . I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the   leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . marketing: I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is  up to the designers . industrial designer: And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . user interface: Can I not just  do each one in order ? industrial designer: I you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p project manager: There we are . user interface: That ? industrial designer: Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep .  well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as  your personal preferences,yeah . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions  pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . user interface:  and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control project manager:  .  but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen .  not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . user interface: So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than  than actual buttons project manager: Okay . user interface: o I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and  a menu that you can access . user interface: But we could go back to the pictures of the  , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , marketing: Or if user interface: but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . marketing: Maybe afterwards we could do a  whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . project manager: I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , marketing: user interface: Definitely less cluttered and  but still it's project manager: It's there user interface: Sorry project manager: but it's user interface: I was just I'll just  resume something else I was gonna say . user interface: I I I really think we need to  not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . Okay  , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .  basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are  an energy source , the user interface and which will  in incorporate  an integrated circuit that actually composes the message  based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message ,  and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . I would have have hoped to  do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of  my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . But those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ?  what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . project manager: The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or  what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ?  is there any  because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever .  does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? industrial designer: Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . industrial designer:  that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . industrial designer: you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . marketing: Do we have  ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? user interface: Isn't that your job ? marketing: Because then project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , marketing: I I don't believe I know ,  . industrial designer: but marketing: Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . user interface: It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , marketing: user interface: just maybe a little bit more inspired , marketing: Inspired ? user interface: but basically just the same . user interface: Although what what  suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have  , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . user interface: You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , marketing: Well user interface: which are marketing: that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . marketing: Yeah , but it also has a place , user interface: And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . user interface: But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . industrial designer: Well I  think that's a very interesting idea , but  I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . industrial designer: Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , marketing: Yeah , yeah . user interface: Well it is just so annoying how marketing: Depen project manager: It would have to sor store up the energy marketing:  . user interface: No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably  it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , marketing: - user interface: but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer marketing: user interface: and industrial designer: So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? user interface: you know f marketing: Definitely , project manager:  . marketing: 'cause I'm thinking in terms of   the loss and breakage of  remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a  a home , a  a nest , a place to live , user interface:  . marketing: So if you can dock it ,  you know , you could s argue that this is project manager: And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . project manager: Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . marketing: Well I I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? industrial designer:  . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: You know , industrial designer: I was wondering that , marketing: these are the industrial designer: because I ag I agree that there there're people with  how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , project manager: I I s usually put more money than brains . industrial designer: but Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying  , you know , personal music devices and all that , marketing: Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . industrial designer: are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , marketing: Yeah . marketing: It might be good to know   who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a   s region where people have more than one television in a home ? industrial designer:  . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ?  we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . project manager: Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . project manager: What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? marketing: Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . user interface: We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , project manager: Probably not . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful . marketing: Do we need  let me project manager: Is that agreeable to everyone ? marketing: Br actually ,  industrial designer: industrial designer: Do you want the gizmo ? marketing: yeah , which might project manager: Throw some light on that . project manager:  actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . marketing: Okay , I I my only comment is I think maybe  we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . Again , you know , project manager: Is that okay with you ? marketing: thinking of menus or user interface: Sorry , project manager: Would that industrial designer: H how does that work ? user interface: I was miles away . industrial designer: How so so how does that work , user interface: I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . industrial designer: how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? marketing: if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe  when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter  project manager: Then you'd have to have an off te off key . marketing: so you press power after you've  well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , industrial designer: Okay , yep , marketing: and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . industrial designer: It's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this , marketing: Well industrial designer: or are we just not aiming at granny ? marketing: Or y yeah . user interface: Who's got an iPod then ? industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , project manager:  . Anyway ,  that was the only comment about  some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . user interface: Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , marketing: Exactly . user interface: like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . user interface: I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , marketing: Yeah . project manager: I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . project manager: As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . project manager:  so are we agreed then of those things ? And let's go back to agenda marketing: D project manager: and hook me up . industrial designer: How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? project manager:  you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , industrial designer: Ah okay , it toggles through , project manager: thank you a lot for telling me .  will be completed q questionnaire ,  then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research  and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together .  your individual assignments are for  Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching .  and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , project manager: Okay . marketing: because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself project manager:  the teletext is outdated , industrial designer: So we're still in meeting , aren't we ? project manager: the internet is important , marketing: Yeah , I think I've project manager: it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan  marketing: Okay . Sorry , what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ? project manager: It doesn't tell me "

        " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "user interface: project manager: and  , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and  Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for  myself , because it'll be more about  , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , marketing: industrial designer: which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . industrial designer: so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to  allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .  , from  , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or  something fam familiar . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just  take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . So if we lost the  remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room .  , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .  , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects ,  we've learnt about smart materials where   specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . user interface: marketing: industrial designer: So they can be heated and  and cooled , and they change the shape of  the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So  , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated ,  everything would spring apart . So , all the  individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much  responsibility for all the  companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . project manager: So that , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? industrial designer:  And then Yeah . Yeah they would ,  you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy .  , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .  , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . Would we be the company that would break down these , or  metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ? industrial designer: You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . industrial designer: but project manager: One thing we have to consider is our  one hundred percent  turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . project manager: so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de  deconstructed . industrial designer: So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high  quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but project manager: Alright . project manager: I'm sorry , could you industrial designer: There we go project manager: Those were  industrial designer: .  , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . industrial designer: Okay ? So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ? There we go . Can you see ? marketing: Oh , user interface: Do you think Is it  , function eight yeah ? project manager: Yeah .  , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international .  , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . user interface: I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use .  , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? marketing: So as far as we know , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? user interface: Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it  compatible with different brands of devices . user interface: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , marketing: D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? user interface: yeah , project manager: Right . project manager: Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? industrial designer: I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . Do you think ? marketing: Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . project manager: Alright , well , marketing: project manager: are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? marketing: Yes I am . Except you're not hooked up to the marketing: Oh , user interface: marketing: I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .  , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first  kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly .  , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , and some internet research . project manager: I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? marketing: we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . marketing: Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , industrial designer:  . marketing: you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . project manager: I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? marketing: Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . marketing: As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . project manager: And another thing with  lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be  a lot more durable , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: because I find with  channel-changers that , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . marketing: And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the  relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used .  , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . user interface: It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . marketing: So like a running banner , underneath project manager: No it's a button that you press , and then you , like a menu pops up . industrial designer: It's like user interface: And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . industrial designer: Yeah , it's just information that  , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and marketing: Right . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , industrial designer: To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . marketing: Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ? project manager: That's rather sad . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: maybe our industrial designer: Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . marketing: But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control .  , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . project manager: I agree with  if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . project manager: and especially if we are  trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . project manager: ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . marketing: So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . industrial designer: And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , project manager: industrial designer: but could be very difficult to get the specific  design . project manager: We need to decide if that is our  intention is , is a simplistic design . project manager: because if , if it is then I think voice ,  voice-activated marketing: It looks like project manager: Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , marketing: project manager: because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .  an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . industrial designer: What , what would appear on the screen ? project manager: I have no idea still . marketing: now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be industrial designer: Like linked in with the teletext , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . user interface: marketing: Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . Every remote control looks the same , so  in my opinion it should be , user-friendly and unique . user interface: marketing: So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product industrial designer:  .  if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . user interface: And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out marketing: you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . marketing: so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . And if one of the largest , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , user interface: Twenties . project manager: I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . Before we go into  more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions .  , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control .  , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television  function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Another thing that might  affect other decisions is that  the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . industrial designer: Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? project manager: well ,  we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , industrial designer: Yeah . This is for the design , the design of the product is that  we wanna create ,  more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , all the remote controls must have our  We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . project manager: So , perhaps  our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . project manager: it doesn't have to be the colour of our  of our company industrial designer: Just project manager: but , another thing is that ,  industrial designer: project manager: we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon .  , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be  somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .  , so , now we need to discuss ,  and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . industrial designer: marketing: Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if project manager: Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . project manager: Do you know if anywhere else has it ? industrial designer: I don't know . industrial designer: But if Was it a management decision that we're having project manager: It was a management decision , industrial designer: Okay . project manager: so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . industrial designer: Minimal marketing: And the What was the word they used ? F findability is important . project manager: 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared user interface: Yeah . user interface: Would you be able to , put the little device anywhere ? 'Cause  isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , so industrial designer: If user interface: you'd ha industrial designer: Do you mean the the link between the user interface: Yeah , with the button that you pressed . user interface: C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . project manager: Yeah , it would have t industrial designer: Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be  yeah not very obtrusive . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . user interface: Would it need a battery then ? project manager: Maybe ,  industrial designer: Pr probably . industrial designer: Unless it could be project manager: That's your department you'll have to sort that out .  , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . project manager: Yeah , you'll have to industrial designer: So , more research into that one . project manager: Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , user interface: industrial designer: Yeah .  , alright , and I'm sure that , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system ,  is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ? industrial designer: Y marketing: On the buttons ? user interface: I I like the light up suggestion . user interface: 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: it doesn't user interface: I would go for marketing: It could it could be a tactile thing as well .  right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . industrial designer: Like a raised marketing: and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S user interface: Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised . user interface: Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? industrial designer: Yeah marketing: Yeah . marketing: I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . project manager: But  industrial designer: And also y ,  Heather you mentioned before ,  like how it should be accessible to everybody . industrial designer: So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . project manager: 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , like the actual soft plastic , costs that much more than other colours . marketing: I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , industrial designer: Yeah . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . marketing: And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . industrial designer: I project manager: for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? marketing: Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . marketing: if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . marketing: Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . industrial designer: So , self-timed marketing: So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . project manager: So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , better for people with  els no industrial designer: durable . project manager: what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? industrial designer: Oh yeah .  , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? industrial designer: project manager: Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? user interface: If project manager: Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . industrial designer: Yeah , and we could marketing: whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . industrial designer: Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , marketing: So industrial designer: which could like link in with the company colours . industrial designer: or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so project manager: Right . user interface: I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the  Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . And do you have anything marketing: What  project manager: Do you have anything to say ? marketing: Oh sorry . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Interchangeable thing ? marketing: Yeah , project manager: Like an iPod or something ? user interface: That would be good . marketing: And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . user interface: Yeah , and then that would be  more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . industrial designer: als project manager: You'd just get one mould , user interface: No . industrial designer: Interchan And also possible  , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or project manager: Yeah . project manager: So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . project manager: Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? industrial designer: I've project manager: Because we need to investigate the financial implications . Is it industrial designer: Let's project manager: Does it need to be  decided on now ? Or should we industrial designer: I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

It worked good ? phd a: Yeah , it works . phd e: Oh , good ! phd a: But it 's So , right now it 's the mechanism with SSH . phd e: Great ! phd a: I don't s I didn't set up You can also set up a CVS server on a new port . phd e: right ? phd a: But I didn't do that because I was not sure about security problems . I I would have to phd e: So w when you came in from Belgian Belgium , using SSH , was it asking you for your own password into ICSI ? So if yo you can only do that if you have an account at ICSI ? phd a: Right . phd e: Cuz there is an a way to set up anonymous CVS right ? phd a: Yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a CVS server but then , yeah , you can access it . phd e: So the anonymous mechanism phd a: You can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this . Because a lot of the open source stuff works with anonymous CVS and I 'm just wondering  , for our transcripts we may want to do that . professor b: Yeah , for this stuff I don't think we 're quite up to that . So ,  phd e: What 's new ? professor b: Well , I think maybe the thing to me might be I me I 'm sure you 've just been working on on , details of that since the meeting , right ? And so phd a: Mmm , since the meeting , well , I I 've been I 've been train training a new VAD and a new feature net . professor b: But I guess maybe the thing since you weren't yo you guys weren't at that that meeting , might be just just to , sort of recap , the the conclusions of the meeting . Cuz that was sort of ,  we we 'd sort of been working up to that , that that , he would come here this week and and we would sort of phd e:  - huh . professor b: Since he 's going out of town like now , and I 'm going out town in a couple weeks , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ? phd e:   professor b: And ,  and what do we freeze ? And , you know , what do we ? So ,  . So then there 's something central and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially . professor b: and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , a particular way , and decide on what things are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything . So we 've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable . phd e: Are you gonna use which of the two techniques ? phd a: So finally it 's it 's , Wiener filtering on FFT bins . And it uses , two steps , smoothing of the transfer function , the first step , that 's along time , which use recursion . And after this step there is a further smoothing along frequency , which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins . And ,  phd e: So this is on the  , before any mel scaling has been done ? phd a: Yeah , yeah . phd e: This is phd a: It was professor b: This this smoothing is done on the estimate , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ? phd a: Yeah . So we are going to fix this for the moment and work on the other aspects of the whole system . phd a: So professor b: Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject . This module , in principle , i  , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it .  , well you don't I guess you don't re - synthesize speech , but you could phd a: We we do not fo professor b: but you could . phd a: Well well , we do , but we don't don't re - synthesize . In in the program we don't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . professor b: But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here . professor b: Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well . But for the real situation  , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . And , generate new files or whatever , and and ,  and then do the reverberation part . He 's  , e phd e: I guess he 's busy with professor b: Yeah , prelims , right . professor b: but but , you know , that 'll  , it 's clear that we ,  we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable . And that 's  , in the past we 've looked at , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and ,  and additive noise , so convolutional effects and and additive effects . And we have , the , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around . But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . And , so Dave has something which , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard . So we have to start Since any almost any real situation is gonna have  , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we we actually have to think about both at the same time . professor b: So ,  So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have . phd a: Yeah , well , the , the other parts of the system are the the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot . professor b: So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , that 's done at the FFT level . And then the mel and then the log , and then the phd a: Then the LDA filter , professor b: LDA filter . phd a: mmm , then the downsampling , professor b: And then  downsample , phd a: DCT , professor b: DCT , phd a: then , on - line normalization , professor b: on - line norm , phd a: followed by upsampling . phd a: And finally frame dropping , which  , would be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . And the input of this neural network would be somewhere between log mel bands or one of the earlier stages of the processing . So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff . So the things that we , I guess we sort of  , There 's there 's some , neat ideas for V A So , in I think there 's sort of like There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff . There 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise . But structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , are are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , a a significantly better VAD , putting the neural net on , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , neural net at the end there , and , the , opening up the second front . phd e: The other half of the channel ? professor b: Yeah , yeah , cuz we we have we have , half the the , data rate that they allow . phd e: That what you mean ? professor b: And , so the initial thing which came from , the meeting that we had down south was , that , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one . We probably will go to something better later , but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , phd e:   phd e: So if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gonna freeze it , and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ? phd a:   It , phd e: In terms of ranking ? phd a: Ri - right now it 's second . professor b: Although you you know , you haven't tested it actually on the German and Danish , have you ? phd a: No , we didn't . phd e: So on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ? professor b: Yeah . Would it  But When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the ,  that the best system before got on ,  also without German and Danish ? phd a: Yeah , yeah . professor b: Well ranking didn't before , but I 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the German and Danish , phd a: Yeah . phd e: Where where where were we actually on the last test ? professor b: Oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were  , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems . And so , I guess by that we were third , but  , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place . phd e: We 're so this second that you 're saying now is system - wide second ? professor b: See  , no I think it 's also institutional , isn't it ? phd e: Still institutionally second ? professor b: Right ?  , I think both of their systems probably phd a: we are between their two systems . professor b: And and , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things .  , one could argue about the LDA and so forth but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things . But what what phd e: So how did they fill up this all these these bits ?  , if we 're u professor b: why are we using half ? Well , so you could you c phd e: Yeah . Or how are they using more than half , I guess maybe is what I professor b: Yeah , so I I think  , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I I think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects . And they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us . phd e: So th So professor b: So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample . professor b: So phd e: So what if you didn't So do you explicitly downsample then ? Do we explicitly downsample ? professor b: Yeah . phd e: And what if we didn't do that ? Would we get worse performance ? phd a:  Yeah , not better , not worse . professor b: I think it doesn't affect it , does it ? phd e: I see . So I think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information . professor b: And , so I you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream  , helps a lot . So that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple . And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , \" oh , yeah , I understand \" , is is very helpful . phd e: So you would you 're You 're thinking to put the , mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ? professor b: Well , that 's a question . It looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , remove the noise , and , phd e: Cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ? professor b: Yeah . There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not . phd d: Well , it it it it so it actually makes it dependent on the overall energy of the  , the frame . professor b: If you do or don't normalize ? phd d: If yo if you don't normalize and if if you don't normalize . And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , \" OK , this much effect \"  , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens . And then saying , oh  particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization . So , I would think you would wanna have some baseline that says , \" OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get \" , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization . phd e: So this second stream , will it add latency to the system professor b: No , it 's in parallel . phd e: or ? grad c: Para professor b: We 're not talking about computation time here . grad c: So with this , new stream would you train up a VAD on both both features , somehow ? phd d: No , I guess the VAD has its own set of features . that 's phd d: which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams . phd a: And there is also the idea of using TRAPS , maybe , for the VAD , which ,  phd d: Yeah , that 's also phd a: Well , Pratibha apparently showed , when , she was at IBM , that it 's a good idea . grad c: Would would that fit on the handset , or ? Oh ! phd a: I have no idea . phd d: Well , it has t  the th phd a: It would have to fit but Yeah . And so I guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based TRAPS , and and how big are they ? So that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue . grad c: Cuz she also does the ,  the correlation - based , TRAPS , with without the neural net , just looking at the correlation between professor b: Right . professor b: Or a simple neural net , right ?  , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple  , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . professor b: And so , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal . professor b: So , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? Do you need to have an added layer or something ? In which case , potentially , you know , it could be big . phd e: So the meeting with Hynek that you guys just had was to decide exactly what you were gonna freeze in this system ? Is that ? Or was there ? Were you talking about what t new stuff , or ? professor b: What to freeze and then what to do after we froze . And like I was saying , I think the you know , the basic directions are , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , the second stream . phd d: So , I 'll ,  I 'll actually after the meeting I 'll add the second stream to the VAD and maybe I 'll start with the feature net in that case . It 's like , you 're looking at the VAD , right ? phd a: yeah . phd d: OK , so just figure how to take the features from the final phd a: Yeah . But , yeah , I think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ . phd e: What about the , the new part of the evaluation , the , Wall Street Journal part ? professor b: Right . Well you you may be called upon to help , on account of , all the work in this stuff here has been , with small vocabulary . So what how is the , interaction supposed to happen ?  , I remember the last time we talked about this , it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , people 's features and then running them or they were gonna give the system out or phd d: Yeah . professor b: Do we already have it ? phd d: Yeah , th I I guess it 's almost ready . phd e: So we 'll have to grab this over CVS or something ? phd d: It - no , it 's just downloadable from their from their web site . professor b: Cuz one of the things that might be helpful , if you 've if you 've got time in all of this is , is if if these guys are really focusing on improving , all the digit stuff , maybe and you got the front - end from them , maybe you could do the runs for the phd e: OK . professor b: and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , tweak Joe about or whatever , phd e: Sure . professor b: S phd d: So I 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding . So I phd e: And it but it 's not ready yet , the system ? phd d: I I think they are still , tuning something on that . So they 're like , d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance . phd e: Are those going to be parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ? Or ? phd d: w I guess there is , time during which people are gonna make suggestions . phd d: So these sugges these this , period during which people are gonna make suggestions is to know whether it is actually biased towards any set of features or professor b: Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things . professor b: in which case , H Hari or Hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this . phd e: And we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to work with professor b: Yes .  , some of that may be , a last minute rush thing because if the if our features are changing  . Yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , it 's starting to seem to me now like November fifteenth is right around the corner .",
        " And , if they haven't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gonna be for this , when \" deciding \" is not just somebody deciding .  , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . phd e: So wha what 's the significance of November fifteenth ? professor b: That 's when the evaluation is . So , yeah , so after But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off . But , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , I 'm I 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while . There 's there 's not anybody OGI currently who 's who 's , working with this and and phd e: Is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ? professor b: I I think it 's it 's ,  it depends how badly you do . phd d: b phd e: This is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ? professor b: Yeah . Well , it 's it 's Conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if I 'm wrong , but my impression is that , they want it as a double check . That you haven't come across you haven't invented features which are actually gonna do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary . professor b: the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary . phd e: Seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero . Y you passed the threshold or you didn't pass the threshold , and they shouldn't even care about what the score is .  , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal , phd e: Yeah . professor b: right ? It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that . So you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect . So again , if you 're if you get If it doesn't help you much , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , you know , it may not hurt you that much . professor b: But if it if you don't if it doesn't help you much at all , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people , if their strategies do , then phd e:   So is this ,  ?  , Guenter was putting a bunch of Wall Street Journal data on our disks . phd e: So that 's the data that we 'll be running on ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: well there 's training and test , right ? phd e: I I guess , I 'm not sure . professor b: No , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it . phd e: I just professor b: So I wouldn't So it it 's phd e: OK . But I think it 's trained on clean and Is it trained on clean and and test on ? phd d: The Wall Street ? professor b: Yeah . It 's training on a range between ten and twenty DB , I think , and testing between five and fifteen . phd d: It 's ,  It 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of . phd a: and So the noise is There is a range of different noises also  which are selected randomly and added randomly , to the files . When did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ? phd d: I guess I guess one some preliminary version is already there . phd e: Oh , so there 's w something you can download to just learn ? phd d: Yeah , it 's already there . phd e: OK , phd d: But they 're actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , I think . phd d: So I guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of , like , one more week maybe . grad c: Is this their , SVM recognizer ? phd d: No , it 's just a straightforward  . professor b: You know , their their They have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing . phd d: Yeah , this is a g yeah , this i professor b: what ? phd d: yeah . phd e: So , just so that I understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that basically , you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ? Is that the idea ? phd d: I I I think yeah , I I guess something like that . phd d: is what Do they provide all the scripts , everything , and then Just , phd e: I see . Somehow yo there 's hooks to put your features in and phd d: ju Yeah , I th I think . In fact , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable You know Joe , right ? Yeah . professor b: Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , different features having different kinds of , scaling characteristics and so on . So that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ? phd e: OK . phd d: So sh shall we , like , add Chuck also to the mailing lists ? It may be better , in that case if he 's going to professor b: Yeah . phd d: Yeah , I guess maybe Hari or Hynek , one of them , has to send a mail to Joe . phd d: Well , yeah , to add or maybe wh phd e: I I know him really well . professor b: Do you have Hari 's ,  ? phd e: I have Hari 's professor b: Yeah , so maybe just CC Hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here , and , you know , phd e: OK . Why don't you just ask Joe but CC Hari , and then in the note say , \" Hari , hopefully this is OK with you \" . professor b: That way you can get started asking Joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and  Yeah . phd d: And there is an , archive of all the mails that has been gon that has gone , between these people among these people . phd d: So , like like , it 's , like professor b: Have you thought about how long would be  , most useful for you to go up to OGI ? phd a: I don't know ,  . professor b: Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? phd a: I professor b: it 's to you . professor b: I ju you guys are Well , y anyway , you don't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . And , I was looking at some of the work that , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So she has ,  she has temporal patterns for , a certain set of phonemes , from from TIMIT , right ? the most common phonemes .  , so she has ,  a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands . And , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , is a clustering algorithm that , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters  , corresponding to the number of data , patterns that you have in the data . phd e: And then you can pick , values anywhere along that tree to fix your set of clusters . grad c: Right , usually it 's when ,  when the sol similarity measures , don't go down as much . And what she found was , sh  , was there were five broad ,  broad categories , corresponding to , things like , fricatives and , vocalic , and , stops .  , and , I was thinking about ways to to generalize this because w you 're it 's sort of like a it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering , because yo beforehand you have these these TRAPS and you 're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme .  , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have .  , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , arbitrary windows in time , of varying length , and cluster those . grad c: And I 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , this is a relatively stable stable point . grad c: and I 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate ,  intermediate categories that , I 'll later classify . F  , I 'm professor b: Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ? grad c: Yeah , yeah . I I haven't exactly figured out , the exact details for that but , the the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , critical band , energies , over different lengths of time . professor b: Yeah , it seems somehow that needs th  , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this . professor b: if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have  , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands .  , and then the other thing , is that I wonder about with it , and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything , grad c: Right . professor b: the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters  , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , unsupervised nearness of things , is actually better . professor b: and I don't know if that  , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance , you can imagine , i i if you remember from from ,  from your your quals , John Ohala saying that , \" buh \" and \" puh \" differed , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration . professor b: So , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together . And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , pfft , screwing up on this distinction . professor b: So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work . And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like . And since they sort of work , it means that they are already doing if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , \" how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? \" grad c:   professor b: Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this , right ? grad c:   professor b: So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do . So , what are we bringing to the party ?  , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , is better at distinguishing between , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together .  , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that ,  that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation . But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , categories that , can clarify these confusions . professor b: So , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ?  , they 're the same sort of thing . professor b: But , you know and and , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters .  , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . phd e: I guess I don't I don't  , it 's not clear to me how to reconcile , you know , what you 're saying , which I think is right , with the way I 've been looking at it . But it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , is bottom - up . phd e: And and so I guess what I don't understand is how to do that and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . professor b: Well , here 's a here 's a ,  Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , what do you really  , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them . Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly . professor b: So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , phd e: Right . professor b: right ? phd e: So the question is , how far down ? professor b: And phd e: We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes . professor b: Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes . You know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , metric of of goodness , i if our phd e:   professor b: correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , maybe we should be looking at words . professor b: for for for very nice , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but i i i if you go all the way to words , that 's really  , d w In many applications you wanna go further . You wanna go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing . And and phd e: Yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can use , and and so everybody goes to phonemes . But the problem is that we we build models of words in terms of phonemes and these models are are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models . See , so her here 's maybe where If the issue is that we 're trying to come up with , some sort of intermediate categories which will then be useful for later stuff , then maybe it doesn't matter that we can't have enough phd e:   professor b: what you wanna do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition . professor b: And and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories  , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments phd e:  Right . In some ways it 's really not a bad bad thing to do because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal . professor b: so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , phd e: Right . professor b: where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit , phd e:  - huh . professor b: and  yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through . professor b: You know , so that 's , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But  , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it phd e: No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have  , you know , categories . If you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters  professor b: Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is ,  i Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true . professor b: If you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , for the most part . Yeah , professor b: So so , it doesn't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level . professor b: if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier and and and , the phones are  , you know , it 's gonna be based on bad pronunciation models that you have of phd e:  professor b: and ,  And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon phd e: Mmm . So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there you know , we we deal with that , but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , and and it doesn't really hurt , and I 'm not sure how how to build that in . professor b: Yeah , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit  , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at  , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , you know , between words if you want or or or , even phones in in in in read speech , say , when there is noise . You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it ? grad c:   professor b: I know one thing that happens is that you you you , you lose the , low energy phones . And if that if that is if it  , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , I don't know , I w I would I would guess that you 'd grad c:   Anyway , that 's phd e: I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably coming from a much higher level . phd e: You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there . professor b: but  , even if you do  , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , than the machines are . If we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it , but especially if it looks like the potential is there "

        "professor c: OK , what are we talking about today ? phd b: I don't know . phd a: Oh , this was the , talk where they were supposed to try to decide phd b: To to decide what to do , phd a: Ah , right .  , so  , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , phd b: Yeah . professor c: because even if they tell us that , the rules are different , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .  , well , we 've a little bit worked on trying to see , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . phd d: To improve phd b: So , We took first we took the LDA filters and , we designed new filters , using  recursive filters actually . professor c: So when you say \" we \" , is that something Sunil is doing or is that ? phd b: I 'm sorry ? professor c: Who is doing that ? phd b: us . phd b: So we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed , IIR filters that have the same frequency response . phd b: So they had two filters , one for the low frequency bands and another for the high frequency bands . And the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay , and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the IIR filters . So we have the filters but we still have to implement a routine that does recursive filtering professor c: OK . phd b: and professor c: You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ? phd b: No . professor c: right ? So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing , phd b: Yeah .  , I yeah , I don't know if th that 's what they were trying to They were trying to do something different like taking ,  well , using filter that takes only a past professor c: Right . I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . Well , there is w one , remark about these filters , that they don't have a linear phase . phd b: Well , I don't know , perhaps it perhaps it doesn't hurt because the phase is almost linear but .  , and so , yeah , for the delay I gave you here , it 's it 's , computed on the five hertz modulation frequency , which is the mmm , well , the most important for speech so . professor c: So that would be , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds , phd d: The low f f phd b: Yeah . professor c: which ,  What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ? phd b: Three hundred and thirty . professor c: So that would be within ? phd b: Yeah , but there are other points actually , which will perhaps add some more delay . Is that some other other stuff in the process were perhaps not very  perf well , not very correct , like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames . phd b: so we will try also to add a nice downsampling having a filter that that professor c:  - huh .  , because wh when when we look at the LDA filters , well , they are basically low - pass but they leave a lot of what 's above twenty - five hertz . phd b: and so , yeah , this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again . phd b: yeah , and then there 's a third thing , is that , basically the way on - line normalization was done  , is just using this recursion on on the  , on the feature stream , professor c: Yeah .  , and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty - five milliseconds . If we want to be very correct , so if we want to the estimation of the mean t t to to be well , the right estimation of the mean , we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future . We would be at six so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling , plus eighty - five for the on - line normalization . So it 's professor c: phd b: plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA . phd b: So it would be around two hundred and forty so , well , professor c: Just just barely in there . phd a: What 's the allowable ? professor c: Two - fifty , unless they changed the rules . phd a: What were they thinking of changing it to ? professor c: But phd b: Yeah . professor c: well the people who had very low latency want it to be low  , very very very narrow , latency bound . professor c: Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency , but phd a: Ah ! professor c: But , phd b: Yeah , and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency . professor c: Yeah , so they were basically  , they were more or less trading computation for performance and we were , trading latency for performance . And they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't , and so I think of it as complementary , that if we can put the phd a: Think of it as what ? professor c: Complementary . professor c: I think the best systems so , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system , which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years . So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise . And , we did this , RASTA - like filtering which was done in the log domain and was tending to handle convolutional noise . So , the , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job . And so , we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff . I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency . To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing . And and , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .  , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server and , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . professor c: These aren't large vocabulary things so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and . phd a: And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency . What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , the the the surgical , microscopes and so forth .  , how long was it from when somebody , finished an utterance to when , something started happening ? phd a: we had a silence detector , so we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector . phd a: And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance . phd a: but it was , I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds . phd a: So professor c: Yeah , so you you so you had a phd a: this w professor c: so you had a a quarter second delay before , plus some little processing time , phd a: Right . professor c: And there 's physical inertia there , so probably the the motion itself was all phd a: And it felt to , the users that it was instantaneous . professor c: Yeah , so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something . A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds , and I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .  , basically if you yeah , if you said , \" what 's the ,  what 's the shortest route to the opera ? \" and it took half a second to get back to you , phd a: Yeah . phd a: because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances . So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done . Well , anyway , I think we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time by by , playing around a little bit , going more into the past , or something like that . phd a: So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ? professor c:   professor c: And there 's also well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , multi - frame , KLT . phd a: Wasn't there Was it in the , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ? professor c: They weren't looking ahead much . And and then But you also could just , we haven't experimented with this but I imagine you could , predict a , a label , from more in the past than in than than in the future . phd a: but I don't think professor c: Yeah , but we 've but we played a little bit with with asymmetric , guys . So , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with , s messing around with this , phd b: yeah . And , phd d: Also we were thinking to to , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson phd b: Yeah . professor c: phd a: What is the advantage of that ? phd d:  phd b: Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear . Well , it 's it 's a linear transformation , that  professor c: So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative , what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you . Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also . And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation . professor c: Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything . professor c: But maybe it 's just the discrimination and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary . But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction , so you just kind of ,  phd b: Yeah . professor c: At what stage do you do that ? Do you you 're doing that ,  ? phd b: So it would be on the  on on the mel frequency bands , phd d: We was think phd b: so . professor c: OK , phd d: Yeah , professor c: so just do that on the mel f phd d: we no nnn We we was thinking to do before after VAD or phd b: Yeah , phd d: Oh , we don't know exactly when it 's better . phd b:  phd d: Before after VAD or professor c: So so you know that that that the way that they 're phd d: and then phd b:  . professor c: one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries . professor c: The reason for that was that ,  if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , or one had a better VAD than the other since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task , and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection . It still wouldn't be perfect but  , e the argument was \" let 's not have that be part of this test . \" And so , I guess they argued about that yesterday and , yeah , I 'm sorry , I don't don't know the answer but we should find out . So ,  Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD but otherwise it 's it 's on the the ,  the mel fil filter bank , energies I guess ? phd d:   professor c: And you 're you 're subtracting in the in the in the I guess it 's power power domain , or or magnitude domain . phd b: and professor c: if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain but but , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain phd b: Yeah . professor c: I have asked people why and they shrug their shoulders and say , \" oh , it works . professor c: and there 's this I guess there 's this mysterious  people who do this a lot I guess have developed little tricks of the trade .  , there 's there 's this ,  you don't just subtract the the estimate of the noise spectrum . phd b: so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise , and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR . phd a:  ! phd b: When the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level , the coefficient is small , and around one . But when the power le the s signal level is  small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important . And this reduce actually the music musical noise , phd a: Oh ! phd b:  which is more important during silence portions , phd a:  - huh . professor c: Well , that 's  , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s  , spectral subtraction methods . phd a:  ! professor c: if if you have , fair assurance that , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise , get a much better estimate , and subtract it off . professor c: But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , with some forgetting factor or something . phd a: So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ? professor c: Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . So one of the things that , Hans - Guenter Hirsch did ,  and pas and other people actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess , was to , take some period of of of speech and in each band , develop a histogram . And , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this . phd a: A couple seconds ? professor c: So No , no , it 's based on this kind of method , phd a:  . Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram , which you could approximate as two Gaussians . professor c: So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians , you you n know what they are , and , sorry , you estimate what they are , and , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , determine through magical means that that , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is .  , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just ,  you can do a w a  an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only . professor c: And then you just use those mean values as being the the ,   signal - to - noise ratio in that band . phd a: But what is the it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency . Cuz if you don't look into the future , right ? phd a: OK , well that I guess that was my question , professor c: if you just yeah phd a: yeah . professor c: if you just if you you ,  a at the beginning you have some phd a: Guess . professor c: esti some guess and and ,  phd b: Yeah , but it professor c: It 's an interesting question . I wonder how they did do it ? phd b: Actually , it 's a mmm If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future .  , if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , what you can expect is to have an estimation of th of the noise in in the middle of the window , not at the end . So professor c: Well , yeah , phd b: the but but people professor c: but what does what what what does Alcatel do ? phd d:   grad e: Pretty stationary , phd b: but ,  professor c: Well , the thing , e e e e grad e: yeah . professor c: Yeah , y  , you 're talking about non - stationary noise but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise , phd b: Well , if y if you have a good estimation of the noise , professor c: you know ? phd b: yeah , because well it it has to work . professor c: But it 's hard to phd b: i professor c: but that 's hard to do . So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise . professor c: If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech , even if it 's centered , right ? phd b:   professor c: if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . professor c: imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum , phd b: Mmm . So , phd b: So in this case , yeah , sure , you cannot professor c: Yeah . phd b: But I think y  , Hirsch does experiment with windows of like between five hundred milliseconds and one second .  and he worked on non - stationary noises , like noise modulated with well , wi with amplitude modulations and things like that , phd a: Were his , windows centered around the phd b: and But  , yeah . professor c: No , I understand it 's better to do but I just think that that , for real noises wh what what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary phd b: Mmm . professor c: and other things where it 's not so stationary and  , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods , phd b:  . professor c: but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice . professor c: I think that it 's  phd a: We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files , and built the averages from them . phd b: What What do you mean ? professor c: Just cheat You 're saying , cheat . phd b: But if the if the noise is stationary perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm . phd b: We just take th th th the beginning of the utterance and professor c: Oh , yeah , sure . phd b: Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well , scheme professor c: But but phd d: Yeah . phd b: is it very useful professor c: you know , stationary phd a: Very slow adaptation .",
        " phd b: and is the c phd a: th professor c: Right , the word \" stationary \" is has a very precise statistical meaning . But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , compared with our our processing techniques . professor c: So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly . If you if you check it out , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road phd b:   But it 's it 's i i i using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well . professor c: But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech and then later phd b: Yeah . professor c: so they may be you know , may be overly , complicated for for this test but but but , I don't know .  , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , the center of the center of the window .  , phd a: If they 're going to provide a , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ? professor c: Oh , yeah . So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing , right ? Is they 're they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections and getting some ,  phd b: Yeah , they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate , and So . Yeah , so , they h they have an estimate of the noise level and they put a threshold like six or ten DB above , and what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate . It 's like saying what 's under the threshold is silence , professor c: Does France Telecom do this phd b: and grad e:  . professor c: Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ? More or less ? phd b: I d I Y you know , perhaps ? phd d: No .  , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , just , things that that we 've been chatting about but haven't made it into these meetings yet . So you 're coming up with your quals proposal , and ,  Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ? grad e: Oh , two , three , it can be shorter than that .  , but I 'm , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and  Mazin Rahim .  , they they have a system that 's , a multi - band , system but their multi - band is is a little different than the way that we 've been doing multi - band in the past , where  Where we 've been @ @  taking  sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets , and then combining them some somehow down the line , they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , training up a detector that detects for , these phonetic features for example , he presents  , a detector to detect sonorance . And so what what it basically is is ,  it 's there 's at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga  , it 's an AND gate . So , on each sub - band you have several independent tests , to test whether  , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band . And at the at the higher level , for every if ,  The higher level there 's a soft OR gate .  , so if if this detector detects  , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect  , the OR gate at the top says , \" OK , well this frame has evidence of sonorance . \" phd a: What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ? grad e: And these are all Oh , OK .  , and the ,  professor c: So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network . Yeah , so he uses , an EM algorithm to to  train up these  parameters for the logistic regression . professor c: Well , actually , yeah , grad e: The professor c: so I was using EM to get the targets . So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output . And then he uses , i u and then feeding into that are I 'm sorry , there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? Yeah , grad e:   phd a: And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,  are these something that you decide ahead of time , like \" I 'm going to look for this particular feature or I 'm going to look at this frequency , \" or What what what are they looking at ? grad e:  phd a: What are their inputs ? grad e:  Right , so the OK , so at each for each sub - band there are basically , several measures of SNR and and correlation .  , and for for every s every sub - band , e you you just pick ahead of time , \" I 'm going to have like five i independent logistic tests . grad e: And you initialize these parameters , in some some way and use EM to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors . grad e: And then , once you get that done , you you you train the whole whole thing on maximum likelihood .  , and h he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is it 's very robust compared to ,  to typical , full - band Gaussian mixtures  estimations of of sonorance . You get enough of these detectors together , then you have enough information to do , higher level discrimination , for example , discriminating between phones phd a:   grad e: and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer . grad e: So , that 's that 's the direction which I 'm I 'm thinking about going in my quals .  , one is the going towards , using narrow band information for , ph phonetic features of some sort rather than just , immediately going for the the typical sound units . professor c: Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule , which is what , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties , phd a:   And then , the third thing I like about it is , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything , this issue of where the targets come from . So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there phd a:   professor c: and we say , \" OK , we train every \" What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units . But but , along the way how much should we , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?  , because , we don't know  , that this is a particularly good feature .  , there 's no way ,  someone in the audience yesterday was asking , \" well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? \" phd a:   professor c: But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible . professor c: It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less . professor c:  Well not  , it 's g all g narrow band  , i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . It could sh be that you should , not be paying that much attention to , certain bands for certain sounds , in order to get the best result . professor c: So , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that . Now we have I guess done experiments you 've probably done stuff where you have , done separate , Viterbis on the different grad e: Yeah . Did did that help at all ? grad e: it helps for one or t one iteration but  , anything after that it doesn't help . professor c: So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful because in a sense that 's the same sort of thing . You 're taking global information and determining what you how you should But this is this is , I th I think a little more direct . phd a: How did they measure the performance of their detector ? professor c: And Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant . professor c: So he hasn't applied it to recognition or if he did he didn't talk about it . It 's it 's just And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , the ,  he he did a comparison to , you know , our old foil , the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth . But the one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .  , this use of a very smooth , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition but if you knew that what you were gonna do is detect sonorants or not So sonorants and non - sonorants is is is almost like voiced - unvoiced , except I guess that the voiced stops are are also called \" obstruents \" .  , so it 's it 's  , but with the exception of the stops I guess it 's pretty much the same as voiced - unvoiced , phd a:   So , if you knew you were doing that , if you were doing something say for a a ,  a a Vocoder , you wouldn't use the same kind of features . Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition , these smooth envelopes . And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not . phd a: Didn't they professor c: Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent . phd a: Didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment where they said \" if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition ? I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that . professor c: That would that 's you 're right , that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is suppose you did that , got that right . phd b: What could be the other low level detectors , for Other kind of features , or ? in addition to detecting sonorants or ? Th - that 's what you want to to to go for also grad e:  phd b: or ? grad e: What t Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? phd b: Other low level detectors ? Yeah . e  , w easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff but that 's very similar to sonorance . grad e: phd a: When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w grad e: Yeah . professor c: Yeah , so there 's a half dozen like that that are grad e: Yeah , nasality . professor c: Now this was coming at it from a different angle but maybe it 's a good way to start .  , these are things which , John felt that a a ,  a human annotator would be able to reliably mark . So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things . professor c: But stress doesn't , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another , grad e:   professor c: right ? It 's a it 's a good thing to mark and will probably help us ultimate with recognition phd a: Yeah , there 's a few cases where it can like permit and permit . professor c: Well , yeah , but i either case you 'd write PERMIT , right ? So you 'd get the word right . phd a: No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words . As long as you get The sequence , professor c: We 're g if we 're doing if we 're talking about transcription as opposed to something else phd a: right ? Yeah . Yeah , so that 's yeah , that 's , you know , a neat neat thing and and ,  So . grad e: S so , Ohala 's going to help do these ,  transcriptions of the meeting data ? phd a: well I don't know .  , we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans and , grad e:  . phd a: because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that . professor c: that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . professor c: But but , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John and and , and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think .  , so , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ? grad f: Ri Yeah , OK , so , we 're interested in , methods for far mike speech recognition , mainly , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal . So , one approach would be , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one and , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG . And so we 're interested in , comparing the performance of  , a robust approach like MSG with these , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches . grad f: And , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that . phd b: And the de - reverberation algorithm , do you have can you give some more details on this or ? Does it use one microphone ? grad f: o o phd b: Several microphones ? Does it ? grad f: OK , well , there was something that was done by , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , professor c: Avendano . grad f: it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , de - convolution by filtering  , except he used a longer time window , phd b:   And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to ,  include the whole , reverberation  , I don't know what you call it the reverberation response . The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long in the in the time domain for the  for the RASTA filtering to take care of it . And , then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet but have just been tried for enhancement , which , have the assumption that  , you can do LPC  analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone and the , all pole filter that you get out of that should be good . It 's just the , excitation signal that is going to be distorted by the reverberation and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal and , feed that through the i  , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced . professor c: There 's also this , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing , so ,  we have ,  and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal and then there 's the distant microphone signal . And you could as a kind of baseline say , \" OK , given that we have both of these , we should be able to do , a cancellation . \" So that , we we , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation phd b: that 's not a practical thing , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline .  , but And then there are s  , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for ,  for this kind of de - reverberation . Do y do you know any references to any ? Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that . phd b: I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do professor c: But . phd b: well , not not very Well , there is the Avendano work , professor c: Right . phd b: but also trying to mmm ,  trying to f t find the de - convolution filter but in the  not in the time domain but in the  the stream of features  I guess . Well , @ @ there there 's someone working on this on i in Mons professor c: Yeah , OK . phd b: So perhaps , yeah , we should try t to He 's working on this , on trying to professor c: Yeah . phd b: on re reverberation ,  professor c: The first paper on this is gonna have great references , I can tell already . professor c: It 's always good to have references , especially when reviewers read it or or one of the authors and , feel they 'll \" You 're OK , you 've r You cited me . Well , he did echo cancellation and he did some fancier things like , training different network on different reverberation conditions and then trying to find the best one , but . professor c: The oth the other thing , that Dave was talking about earlier was , multiple mike things , where they 're all distant . So , there 's there 's all this work on arrays , but the other thing is , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them , as we as we have over there . It 's part of why you have such good directionality with , with two ears phd b:   professor c: So that Yeah , the the head , in the way , is really that 's what it 's for . It 's basically , phd a: That 's what the head 's for ? To separate the ears ? professor c: Yeah , it 's to separate the ears . professor c: Yeah ? phd a: I think th that may be due to the fact that Adam ran out of digits , and didn't have time to regenerate any . professor c: Oh ! Oh ! I guess it 's Well there 's no real reason to write our names on here then , phd a: Yeah , if you want to put your credit card numbers and ,  professor c: is there ? grad e: Oh , no ? professor c: Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff , phd a: yeah , I do need your names and and the time , and all that , professor c: or ? Oh , OK "

        "industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . project manager:  then industrial designer: project manager: then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . user interface: project manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .  and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .  and then we  will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . S marketing: And then do we get to make a remote control ? industrial designer: project manager: 'Cause we missed out . project manager: So industrial designer: project manager: it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? project manager: Is that right ? user interface: Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . Do you want user interface: So , you said  are are we starting with the the project manager: Yes . user interface: so will you maybe start with like the  the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th  things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and industrial designer: Okay . project manager: user interface: marketing: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? project manager: industrial designer:  marketing: It's a bit  phallic . project manager: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? industrial designer:  so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . project manager: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that user interface:  yeah . marketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? user interface: Yeah , . user interface: yeah , but  one thing we actually kind of  forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: so we said the back side round , yeah . marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . project manager: user interface: So so  the user interface as as we discussed last time   on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . user interface: So we have that n  channels here starting from   one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . user interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . It's it's quite standard  place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . user interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . user interface: And and we would also have a l little  thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . user interface: On the side , marketing: Ah , you did get that in then , user interface: this one . user interface: And and and it's it's on the back is  cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . user interface: See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen project manager: Yeah . user interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen  the middle button . project manager: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you marketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . industrial designer:  on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . user interface: Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? project manager: But if you hold it in , industrial designer:  . marketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? project manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? marketing: Okay , cool . user interface: So I think it project manager: And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . user interface: Yeah , I think  we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: project manager:  it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . project manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but  we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer: project manager: and cut some of the prices that way . marketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .  you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Is that right ? marketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . marketing: Well , I thought we'd  kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? project manager: Yeah , just prepare one now . What do you all say ? industrial designer: So ? project manager: I reckon it user interface: S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing: Yeah . Okay   what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager:  we can if we industrial designer: I can I can take note   marketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . marketing: Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? project manager: Yeah . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer:  the the only thing that we were considering was that  this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager: I think it does .  industrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left  scrolling with your finger . user interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a  another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . project manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem , marketing: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . user interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so they just marketing: Yeah , but  because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , because  anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing: Yeah . user interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's  project manager: marketing: So  that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . marketing: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? project manager:  marketing: What do you what do you all think ? industrial designer:  . user interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , project manager: Yeah , I think I think for  user interface:  . project manager:  most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager: They industrial designer: so it opens on the side . industrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether user interface: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . user interface: Yeah well yeah , project manager: The length is gonna be difficu user interface: but it's it's a bit long . marketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer:  this this kind of  makes it more project manager:  . marketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? industrial designer: No , we have a locator . project manager: No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface:  that you stick on T_V_ . user interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to  to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . If   if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager: Yeah . user interface: and it's I th I think it's project manager: I'd say six , 'cause the  the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . marketing: Yeah , and  d industrial designer: And  even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology project manager: So industrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager: Might be industrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but  it's a good technology ,  once they get used to it . project manager: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . marketing: So , should we maybe say f a five industrial designer: So l marketing: and say it is intuitive , project manager: Five ? marketing: but it's different , so , do you know ,  it's obvious how to use it , project manager: Yeah . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ?  intuitive but Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . marketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? project manager: marketing:  okay , cool , E_ , okay .  I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . user interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's kinda industrial designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . marketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager: Well we've banned them from marketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager: industrial designer:  yeah . industrial designer: And moreover it it has  L_C_D_ and everything , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just project manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . industrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah , user interface: Technologi well industrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . Well  we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . marketing: Yeah , but  you don't project manager: All of the components have been used in other things before . marketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . project manager: What do you reckon , five , six ? marketing: Yeah , what do you all think ? user interface: Six . marketing: Six ? user interface:  how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: Well , that's it ,  user interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , but  everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? project manager: marketing: So , I don't think many peop project manager: Space remote . user interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? project manager: industrial designer: The carrot banana remote . marketing: So , we give it seven , and we write user interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . user interface: What's the assessment ? marketing: So , we need the average here , so we got user interface: The average is about six and something . marketing: So we've got four sevens , user interface: No , wait , a little bit under six . project manager: Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . project manager: Six point point industrial designer: Fifty one divided by user interface: Six point something , yeah . project manager: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . marketing: project manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? marketing:  no , that's it , project manager: That's it ? marketing: yeah . marketing: user interface: project manager: Computer no signal ? industrial designer:  I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . project manager: It could be marketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . project manager: it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . user interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . project manager: We we're definitely going to have to user interface: We have pushbuttons , industrial designer:  . project manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've user interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer: No  we we have  yeah . user interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel project manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface: Okay , let's yeah . project manager: marketing: haven't we ? project manager: I think the pushbutton oh . marketing: 'Cause then you have project manager: I don't know if that's one marketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Push what  industrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit ?  . project manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we user interface: We have to count all of them , or yeah . industrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing: Well it doesn't , but it  project manager: No . industrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . marketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? industrial designer:  and the locator also goes away . marketing:  does project manager: What else does it need ? user interface: Well the speaker  the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . project manager: Yeah , okay , so we industrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . marketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause project manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . We could do industrial designer: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in  in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . user interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton  we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . industrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ project manager: That's with the L_C_ industrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? marketing: Yeah . marketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager: It's nothing n marketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . project manager: Yeah , marketing:  the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but project manager: I have industrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . marketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? industrial designer: project manager: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . project manager: and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , industrial designer: We have , yeah . industrial designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . marketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , industrial designer:  yeah . marketing: and the scroll wheel is  essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . user interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . industrial designer: project manager: Tha user interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the industrial designer: marketing: Oh the the beeper thing . project manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .  we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,  so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . project manager: Feedback ? Ideas ? user interface: Yeah  , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . industrial designer: I think  n one thing that was lacking  was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . marketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . project manager: But in terms of the process of  going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . marketing: so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s project manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah , project manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office . industrial designer: that's it's it's project manager: They great ? industrial designer: I wonder what one of these costs . project manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? marketing: I don't think you should say that was the recording . project manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , marketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the marketing: Yeah . marketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . We could make some little user interface: But yeah , but  already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . marketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? industrial designer: project manager: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . project manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? user interface: To express them   industrial designer:  . user interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and project manager: Yeah . marketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . user interface: Yeah , neither neither do I , project manager: user interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . marketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , project manager: Banana remote . Vibrate user interface: marketing: Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . project manager: well within budget , including a little what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? user interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . industrial designer: I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and  yeah . project manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . industrial designer: We certainly are , project manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . marketing: project manager: It was very productive day and marketing: We could draw animals on the board again . industrial designer: user interface: Oh , you don't like anim marketing: It's just minging . project manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . industrial designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? project manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not . project manager:  presumably I have to marketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? project manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really "

        "I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better? kirsty williams am: Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE\u00a0recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want\u00a0to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well? kirsty williams am: No. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me\u2014what the research does show\u2014that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim\u00a0Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. I met with New York state\u2014significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner\u2014it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status\u2014so, those are people who are training on the job. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that\u2014there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'\u2014actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE\u00a0route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE\u00a0is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it? kirsty williams am: Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important\u2014that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside\u00a0Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and I'm very keen in looking at career changers, who perhaps have different life experience and work experience, coming into our teaching profession. Part of that diversity, of course\u2014it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh. No-one can solve this in 280 characters, I get that, but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it's clear that there's a policy for this country to improve the number of Welsh speakers? You'd have thought there'd be a pretty good carrot for this. Again, data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are, as I said, keeping in touch with our ITE\u00a0centres to keep a close eye on them. I think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of Welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and Welsh ability but don't necessarily do a course that allows them. We do think that, for the 2016-17 cohort, there were an additional 130 qualifiers\u00a0that, actually, were fluent in Welsh and who could have gone on to teach in Welsh-medium schools, didn't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation. But, clearly, we've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we've set ourselves. The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported at the end of last month, and the Minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published, I think, on 28 September, to be able to move this agenda forward. Again, we've got new incentives, this year, both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their QTS after a year. So, we've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues. But, clearly, these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we're to meet them. If they're from Wales, they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one, and we'll accept there are varying\u00a0qualities in different parts of Wales, different attitudes towards it as well. But there isn't a single a person now who's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all, unless they've moved into the system\u00a0from, say, England very, very recently. What is being done within the teaching qualifications, including the degrees, to ensure that, at least in Welsh universities, those nascent Welsh language skills are at least kept alive, even though we're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium? It's\u00a0the age-old question: once the school gate closes, is that the end of their Welsh use? So, is there something\u2014it won't be Donaldson, but in the teacher training qualifications\u2014that is keeping this going and, hopefully, increasing the usability of the Welsh skills they have? kirsty williams am: Well, in terms of how we can encourage children who have got Welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16, how they can\u00a0continue to use those skills and, potentially, use them in the workplace, I'm sure Eluned will want to talk about\u00a0some of the work, for instance, in other, non-teaching sectors. But, with regard to ITE, you'll be aware that, in the evaluation report, as I said, that was published, the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language\u00a0skills\u00a0amongst all primary and secondary ITE\u00a0entrants. So, what we'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we'll be working very closely with our ITE\u00a0centres\u00a0to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ITE\u00a0provision for all teachers. llyr gruffydd am: You have your targets for 2021, in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system, which is positive, although, clearly, the report or the review itself said that, actually, we need to double the numbers, really. But it's not just the trends that are going down; it's a cataclysmic drop, really. We've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh. So, it's a huge turnaround that we're looking for, and I'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you're giving here this morning\u00a0reflect the level of action that's\u00a0needed, really. kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, as I tried to illustrate to Suzy, the figures on their\u00a0own\u00a0tell one story, but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: I think it's\u00a040 per cent\u00a0of those who are currently in the system who don't\u2014 kirsty williams am: \u2014the language and skills. And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type, actually, we see a different trend\u2014we see numbers going up. That's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE\u00a0and that's why we'll be taking that ambition\u00a0forward. Clearly, there are statistics\u00a0and there are statistics, so could you just explain to us which statistics you've used for your targets for growth over the next three years? kirsty williams am: Well, that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you're projecting? kirsty williams am: We're using the baseline of 2012-13. llyr gruffydd am: That's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction'. That's why, as I said, we're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline. In using those numbers, we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings. So, what I'm saying is that that doesn't tell us the whole story, but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions, and I'm not hiding from that. eluned morgan am: Also, I just think it's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak Welsh, who are not teaching through the medium of Welsh, and to give them that support. First of all, we need to identify who these people are, so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular\u2014when people register, let's just make sure that we collect that kind of data. One of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course, so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions. llyr gruffydd am: Have we missed any tricks, potentially, in terms of the reforms to accrediting ITE, for example, in terms of, maybe, strengthening aspects around the Welsh language and provision in that respect? kirsty williams am: No, I don't believe so. The accreditation process, which is independent of the Government\u2014the accreditation process demands of our ITE\u00a0providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum. Our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children, through all stages of their education journey, to be able to be bilingual children. llyr gruffydd am: So, that requirement, as far you're concerned, is there. lynne neagle am: Before I turn to Hefin, can I just clarify\u2014? In answer to Suzy Davies, you said that 65 per cent of the places in Welsh training centres\u00a0had been filled. hefin david am: The decision by the Education\u00a0Workforce Council\u00a0not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training\u2014what are your views and concerns about that? kirsty williams am: The process is independent of Government, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that, especially as I understand that there is an appeals process that may be being undertaken. What I would say is that from the very outset of our ITE\u00a0reforms we have made it very clear that I expect very high standards in our ITE\u00a0system, but the process is independent of this Government. I have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the EWC\u00a0to undertake that process, but it is independent of me, and it's not appropriate for me to comment on that further. hefin david am: I fully understand that and the need for distance for the EWC, but there'll be an impact on students and staff. Students, first of all: are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students, and those students going through the second year at USW? Would you have concerns about that issue? kirsty williams am: In terms of the overall numbers, we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need. Clearly, there will be a responsibility upon the University of South Wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course, with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme. hefin david am: And what about the uncertainty for staff, or would you say that's an issue for the university itself? kirsty williams am: These are autonomous bodies. They have to act accordingly, in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer. That's not a matter for me; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body. hefin david am: But I would be surprised if you weren't keeping an eye on this, given that it has been a key provider. Are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known? kirsty williams am: My understanding is that the appeals process is ongoing, and next month, perhaps. But as I said, this is a process that is independent of Government\u2014 hefin david am: But it will have an impact for what you do. kirsty williams am: It will potentially change the nature of the people from whom we commission places, but as I said, I do not have any concerns that we will not be in a position to commission the appropriate number of training places that we will need as a result of our planning. suzy davies am: It's not directly about USW; it's about the geographic spread of provision. I wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like, and whether you think\u2014certainly for PGCE or postgrad courses, anyway\u2014that if they're not accessible geographically and we've got students who already have three years' worth of debt, they're not going to be looking to, necessarily, live away from home for a fourth year, and may want to study nearer home. Has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad\u00a0courses, about where people are coming from and whether that's had an impact on the fact that some of these places haven't been filled? kirsty williams am: Currently, with our current providers, there is a significant geographical spread. There are centres here in the south-east, there are centres\u00a0in the south-west, in mid Wales, and in north Wales. We do think that, for some students, accessibility is an issue, and of course that's why we are responding with our part-time PGCE\u00a0route, which actually will be location neutral, because you will be able to study that as a distance learner, and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course. So, if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher, our new part-time PGCE, as I said, will allow them to do that. We're going to move on now to talk about reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector. There are some encouraging provisional signs regarding the demand for part-time undergraduate study for the first year of Diamond, but the \u00a312.5 million reduction\u00a0Higher Education Funding Council for Wales\u00a0is having to make this academic year has potentially placed the funding for part-time provision under pressure. Is there a danger that, without maintaining and growing this funding, Welsh Government will undermine the Diamond reforms and increase the cost of part-time courses? kirsty williams am: Let's be absolutely clear what this Government has done for part-time students. We are unique, Janet: unique in the UK and, I believe, unique in Europe, in the parity of the support that is available for full-time and part-time students. So, Welsh part-timers have something that they do not get if they are in England or if they're in Scotland. It's too early to have definitive figures for the impact of Diamond on the number of people who are undertaking part-time study. I don't want to get into trouble by not having that verified data, and I know Members get testy with me for anecdotal evidence, but I can tell you this: there is one provider that is reporting at this moment a 40 per cent increase in the number of students that are registered to start part-time study with them this year, as compared to last year, and that reflects really, really well, compared to the onward downward trend that we see across the border for part-time. What this means, for us as a nation, is that people are able to take this opportunity to upskill themselves and to be able to develop their qualifications and to be able to move themselves up career ladders, and I think that's such an important economic factor for us. So, rather than feeling doom and gloom about the prospects for the part-time sector, the early indications, at least, show that the Diamond reforms are leading to an increase in demand and, more importantly, an increase in uptake\u2014students taking advantage of that system to go away and study. Is the Welsh Government able to reassure the committee that its ambitions for the post-compulsory education and training\u00a0reforms are still in line with the original Hazelkorn recommendations, and go beyond the Labour manifesto commitment of simply replacing HEFCW with a new funding body for HE and FE? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, you will be aware, Janet, that the agreement between myself and the First Minister that brought me into the Government and the Government's programme state very clearly about our desire to pursue the recommendations of the Hazelkorn report. I hope, by the end of this week, we will have published the responses to the technical consultation, and we will continue to move forward. And I would argue, certainly, that the reforms that we are intending to implement do go beyond just simply a body that replaces HEFCW and joins in FE. And, as I said, I believe we've had in the region of about 450 responses to the technical consultation and I'm pleased to say that there remains a consensus\u2014we will always have some arguments about the details\u2014but there remains a consensus on the direction of travel that we are pursuing. A summary of the consultation responses will be available to Members and will be published by the end of the week. Is the Welsh Government still committed to introducing the PCET Bill before the end of the fifth Assembly, and are you confident this will happen? kirsty williams am: Well, I'm absolutely determined that we will get the PCET legislation on the floor. So, it is a substantial piece of work, but I believe that we are on track to be able to do that by the end of this term. llyr gruffydd am: Can I just pick up on that? , it is going to be a big job, and, clearly, there's a strong focus on creating the commission and putting the structures in place, but, of course, one of the drivers is that we want to effect a cultural change in the way that people perceive post-16 education. When are we going to see this coming forward? Because I think we're putting structures in place, so there's a big discussion about the technical stuff, but I feel there's a bit of a vacuum\u00a0in terms of the vision. kirsty williams am: Well, I would disagree with you, Llyr, because\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Right, okay. kirsty williams am: Well, I would disagree with you because, of course, the technical consultation has followed what we had last year, which was a consultation on the vision, on what we needed to do to bring the sector together beyond just HE and FE, to the inclusion of sixth forms; work-based learning providers; apprenticeships; and bringing all of that together under one body. I believe that that gives us an opportunity to have better strategic planning; to help us prevent duplication; to help us bridge gaps that are not available for learners at the moment. My vision is that it will promote collaboration between institutions rather than simply having the market-based process that we see in other places where there's competition rather than collaboration.",
        " I want to see it strengthen links between schools, FE and HE, strengthen links between schools and employers and business, to make sure that we've got better information and advice services so that young people know what their pathways are and can make really informed choices about what's best for them, to help them make them. So, I think: we've done the vision, we're now doing the technical consultation, that will be published by the end of the week, and we'll move forward with our overarching vision that Hazelkorn elaborated and that we are now taking forward. llyr gruffydd am: So, you would be very concerned if FE institutions were saying that we really need to see the vision, that that's the next step, that we really need to understand the vision. As I said, I was with one of our excellent FE leaders\u00a0just at the end of last week; it wasn't raised with me then. I think there's a shared understanding of the vision, but I understand and I\u00a0do see some nervousness about, actually, in the end, will this just be HEFCW by another name, and, the opportunity for FE, will this be realised in this new body? We need to keep ensuring that, as we go forward and develop the policy, and as we develop, eventually, the legislation, that that parity of esteem and that true equality across all parts of the sector is realised. Your paper to the committee says that there's a need for more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds. If you don't have the analysis, how can you be sure that the investment that's being made by the Welsh universities is actually going to have a positive outcome in the right places and lead to better outcomes for underrepresented groups? kirsty williams am: Okay. Well, of course, that would be one of the duties of the new commission set up as a result of our\u00a0post-compulsory education and training reforms that I would anticipate. The universities are required, under the\u00a0Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, to produce fee and access statements, and the \u00a3104 million that they have to take off their fees to be able to promote this work\u2014those fee and access plans have to be signed off by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales as being robust and truly promoting equality of opportunity. We are looking at\u2014.\u00a0It's quite early days, still, for that new regulatory regime to come through, so we ask HEFCW, when I meet with HEFCW, about the adequacy of those plans. That's why we're introducing the Diamond reforms\u2014so that those from the poorest backgrounds can be adequately financially supported and are not put off from going to a university. So, for instance, in the FE sector, we're introducing new joint monitoring for outcomes for sixth-form learners and FE learners, because we've never tracked them in the same way. So, we're introducing that now so that we can see the destinations for those two sectors, but the PCET\u00a0reforms give us an opportunity to do that right across the board. Huw, is there anything else I need to add? huw morris: Well, I'd just reinforce the point the Cabinet Secretary made about the fee and access plans being the vehicle through which\u00a0we get universities to specify what they're going to do, and the funding council tracks that. To make sure that we're doing that in a full and appropriate manner, periodically, we ask for that system to be reviewed. I think it was in 2017 that the\u00a0Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods\u2014the research arm of Cardiff University\u2014reviewed the system and looked at how widening access was being promoted by different institutions and whether that was working in all parts of Wales. The report from that group was considered by one of the sub-committees in HEFCW\u00a0and they are revising the process as a consequence. So, I think we can be confident that there are ambitious targets that are monitored, and, periodically, the system as a whole is reviewed. michelle brown am: Can you tell us what sort of research and data the universities are basing those access plans on? I assume they'll all have slightly different methods\u2014I appreciate that\u2014but can you give us any idea of how they actually formulate these access plans? huw morris: So, there are data collected across the UK by a body called the Higher Education Statistics Agency. They produce detailed breakdowns, along with UCAS, of where applicants come from, which institutions did they study at, what courses, what their particular characteristics are, including their socioeconomic status, and that data is then analysed at a UK level and in Wales, through HEFCW\u00a0and its agents, to track what's happening at different institutions at different stages, not just in terms of who's applying and who gets access, but who progresses and what happens to people once they've graduated. I'm just wondering how that data that's already there differs from the research and analysis that you were talking about in your paper. What specific analysis and research were you referring to in your paper? kirsty williams am: We use the HESA\u2014. kirsty williams am: That's shorthand\u2014the HESA data, and institutions use that. This is a source of real concern to me, that Welsh institutions may not be able to have the ready access to that data because of changes the OfS may be making. So, we supplement where we think that there's value to be added in additional breakdowns, or in additional slicing of data and understanding of what is motivating people to come forward. huw morris: And to give you a specific example of that as it applies in north Wales\u2014. So, take a university like Wrexham Glynd\u0175r University; they have quite a large intake of mature students. The data that's collected and analysed at a UK level tends to look at people who are going into university at a young age, not a mature profile. So, some of the analysis that we do in Wales\u2014indeed, the deliberations of the sub-committee that I spoke about earlier\u2014is about how do we make sure that those differences in Wales are reflected in the data and reflected in the targets that are set. hefin david am: Cabinet Secretary, are you in favour of more university mergers? kirsty williams am: I wouldn't use the word 'agnostic', but what I'm in favour of is a healthy, strong and sustainable HE sector. If individual institutions wish to collaborate or, indeed, go further to a formal merger then, obviously, that is a matter for them. We're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers, but, if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students, obviously, we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans, but that's a matter for individual institutions. kirsty williams am: Well, again, what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector that is strong but, as I said, I do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers. The reason I say it is because I was kind of on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport. You had the University and College Union and the Minister pushing it; the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Met at the time very much against it. So, do you think that it's really\u2014? You're agnostic, but do you think perhaps it's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students? kirsty williams am: As I said, Hefin, I have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers. Going back to the issue of ITE, a very interesting programme came forward from Cardiff Met and Cardiff University for their ITE provision. So, I'm all for universities and institutions working together, but there's no formal policy. If they see that there is an advantage\u2014I would hope for the student first, and, if we put the student at the front of this process, then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do. hefin david am: Just to be clear, then, that's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well; you're not going to change that view. kirsty williams am: I have no intentions at this stage, but 'Events, dear boy'. [Laughter.] You know, sometimes\u00a0there may be a situation that I cannot foresee at this moment that would necessitate, for the benefit of students, the benefit of Wales, a merger. So, never say never, but, at this point in time, I do not foresee us changing that policy. julie morgan am: Yes, just looking back at that time, which I remember very vividly\u2014 hefin david am: So do I. Do you feel there has been any disadvantage to Cardiff Met because that merger didn't go ahead? kirsty williams am: I, personally, am not aware\u00a0of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met, but I would recognise\u2014I would absolutely\u00a0recognise\u2014for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues, then that would have had a personal impact on them. In terms of the institution going forward, I'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion. And, as I said, I'm really heartened\u00a0by some of the really interesting collaborative work that Cardiff Met are interested\u00a0in doing, and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions, whether that be Cardiff Uni\u00a0or local colleges, and I think that's to be welcomed. julie morgan am: So, following on from what Hefin said, was it worth all the fuss? kirsty williams am: Well, look, as it's turned out, we have a strong institution\u00a0in Cardiff Met, and I think, rather than looking at the past, we need to look at the future. But, of course, there was some reconfiguration and we need to understand any lessons that arose out of reconfiguration, and HEFCW are currently doing\u00a0some work, actually, to look at reconfiguration, the experience of\u00a0reconfiguration that did happen, and were benefits realised\u00a0and what are the lessons that can be learned from that process. So, they are doing a piece of work to reflect, and that will, perhaps, help inform us as\u00a0we go forward. hefin david am: I'd just say\u2014Julie Morgan was one of our heroes at the time, I've got to say. If I turn that on its head and have a look at University of South Wales, one of the concerns I'm getting from former colleagues and staff is that the Newport aspect\u2014because it was\u00a0a merger between Newport and the University of Glamorgan\u2014has been somewhat denuded by the merger, and the amount of activity in the new Newport campus and elsewhere in Newport has been reduced by the merger. Are you aware of those concerns that staff may have? kirsty williams am: As I\u00a0said, it's not for me to second-guess the judgment of previous Ministers who pursued\u2014 hefin david am: But it's happening\u00a0now, . Obviously, one campus closed completely, and there are concerns about the level of activity at the new campus. And we continue to discuss with the University of South Wales and the local FE college what offer is available to\u00a0the local population, but also the wider contribution that that institution can make to the rest of Wales, and we continue to have conversations with both\u00a0the college and the university about utilisation\u00a0of the facilities in Newport and opportunities that could be made available in Newport. hefin david am: That's interesting, because\u00a0that's the first time I've heard it confirmed from the Government that those concerns that have been raised by former staff and colleagues in Newport are actually echoed\u00a0by yourself, then. Clearly, going back to the point that I believe Suzy made about geographical coverage, we want to make sure that FE and HE opportunities are available for people throughout Wales, and\u00a0we continue to work with providers\u00a0in that area to explore\u00a0what can be done to enhance the opportunities. hefin david am: And, from a financial point of view, they had \u00a325 million for the merger. Are you satisfied that's value for money, and, at this point in the 10-year plan, that things are going as they should, with incomes being squeezed across the sector? kirsty williams am: Yes. , it's difficult, isn't it, to second-guess what would have happened, what might have happened, if the merger hadn't gone ahead, around the financial stability and sustainability of an institution. How do you prove that, if that hadn't happened, something worse or something better\u00a0might have happened? It's difficult to do that and to second-guess those judgments, but, as I've said, what I am interested in\u2014. And I can't change that decision that was made by a previous Minister\u2014it wasn't my decision\u2014but what I can do is to ensure that any lessons learnt, any evaluation of that particular set of circumstances, can be looked at and can help inform future policy, which is why HEFCW is doing the piece of work. When that's published, you and I will be in a better position to understand whether the aspirations of that particular merger were realised, not realised, and if we were in that situation again, could we do it better next time? hefin david am: Okay, so you'll reflect on that later. At this point in time, you don't have any concerns about the long-term sustainability of the University of South Wales. The Welsh Government's draft outline budget for 2019 states that it will continue to provide \u00a320 million to further and higher education in 2019-20. Can you outline how this will be allocated between HE and FE and if conditions will be attached to the funding? kirsty williams am: Janet, you will have to wait until the end of the month, when the detailed, main expenditure group by main expenditure group lines of the budget are published, otherwise I will be stealing the finance Minister's thunder. There is a process by which the Welsh Government's budget is dealt with, and those details will emerge later on this month. kirsty williams am: But can I just say on conditions\u2014? You will be aware that there are conditions attached to Government spend, both in the FE sector and in the HE sector. Those budgets will be subject to those existing arrangements; so, for instance, in the HE sector, the remit letter to HEFCW. We're\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Can I just pick up on funding, generally? Sorry. Because, we did talk about HEFCW\u00a0and part-time funding earlier, and I'm not sure that we addressed the issue of this \u00a312.5 million cut in a specific budget line from HEFCW, because what they've done, if I understand correctly, is that they've put four priorities into one budget line, which includes part-time teaching, and cut that budget line by \u00a312.5 million. Are you not concerned that that'll have an impact on part-time teaching, given that it's such a success story that you're proud of? kirsty williams am: HEFCW\u00a0have to take cognisance\u00a0of the remit letter, but then, ultimately, they are free to allocate resources as they see fit. What will drive part-time provision is the students taking it up, and universities responding to that desire and that need within their institutions. We're going to move on now to look at the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education. Welsh Government wants to achieve parity of esteem between academic and vocational education, and I think that's a very laudable aim. Higher apprenticeships are a key part of this, but Estyn's recent inspection found that only four providers from 17 were achieving good outcomes for learners. What action do you propose to take about this, to make sure that those learners have much better outcomes across the board? eluned morgan am: First of all, just to make it clear that that is very much our intention. I think we have got work to do to make sure that we do reach that parity of esteem, but let's be clear that, in relation to these higher level apprenticeships, we were concerned that, actually, we weren't doing as well, perhaps, as we should be, which is why we commissioned Estyn to look at this specifically, and what it was that we were doing well, and what we needed to improve on. One of the things that we found is that we are doing very well in relation to foundation courses in terms of attainment\u2014we've got 83 per cent attainment levels\u2014but if you look at that at higher level apprenticeships, then we've got 77 per cent, so what is going wrong there? But, also, it's worth underlining the fact that, actually, we're still miles ahead of England, who are only reaching levels of about 61 per cent. So, we're already doing much better than England, but we're ambitious, and we want to make sure that if we are serious about this parity of esteem, how do we get there if we're not offering the kind of quality that we'd like to see in those higher level apprenticeships? So, some of the recommendations in that report, we'll be taking up. I think we're also very keen to make sure that people don't repeat learning that they've already done. So, there are lots of these recommendations that now we'll set in motion, and I think the important thing for us then is to understand that, in relation to who's doing well and who's not doing well in the FE sector, the bulk of where that finance goes is actually doing quite well. It's pushing some of the private sector providers where we need to actually make sure that the quality is where we want it to be, and is, very importantly, matching the needs of employers. So, we've constantly got to be looking at the courses: are they responding to the needs of the market and what employers are looking for? And that means revising the offer sometimes in terms of the courses. michelle brown am: Where are the difficulties arising\u2014? You refer to difficulties arising with the private providers. What are those difficulties? eluned morgan am: Well, some of it is about, perhaps, not giving the kind of guidance that we'd like them to give in-house. So, they're perhaps not doing the kind of on-the-job work that we'd like them to do. So, I think it's making sure that, when they're in the workplace, they are still being pushed to attain those levels. But I think it's clear that what we need to do is to also listen to what the advisory board that we've set up in relation to apprenticeships is also asking us, and we've got the Confederation of British Industry advising us on that as well. michelle brown am: Do you have a service level agreement with the private providers? eluned morgan am: Yes. , the whole thing is under a tender procedure, obviously, and we will be revising that soon. There'll be a new apprenticeship procurement process that we'll be undergoing and starting to look at that process next year. michelle brown am: Would you be willing to share the targets under the SLA with the committee? eluned morgan am: Well, I think the\u2014. I can't see that there'd be a problem with that, so I'm sure we could do that, but I think the way to make people move, quite often, is through making sure that you put the finances where they need to be, and then they're likely to shift. And, so, I think, in responding to this Estyn report, we can then build that into the next framework. If we're going to get parity of esteem, we've got to, probably, get more investment in. Could you say why there isn't more investment in degree, and there doesn't seem to be any investment in Master's-level apprenticeships at universities? eluned morgan am: Well, I think we've got to be careful that what happens is that the state doesn't pick up what, currently, people are prepared to pay for themselves, and, so, we've got to just make sure that that balance is right. So, what's happened in England, for example, is lots of people who were previously sitting Master of business administration courses, for example, are now switching into apprenticeship programmes. So, the system\u2014it means that, previously, they were prepared to pay and now the state is paying or the employer's playing it in a slightly different way. So, I think we've got to just be aware about how\u2014making sure that we don't get employers passing that responsibility that, actually, they have to upskill and to uptrain\u00a0their workers and pass it back on to the state, whereas, actually, they need to step up as well as employers. julie morgan am: So, how are you going to judge that? How are you going to tell when, maybe, you should start putting some money in? eluned morgan am: Well, what we are doing is we're putting money into areas where we know there are skills shortages. So, we're focusing where we want those apprenticeships\u2014and particularly at the higher level\u2014to be. So, that's where we'll be prioritising our funding, and that's what we're doing already. kirsty williams am: And that's for degree-level apprenticeships, not Master's. And then, in terms of getting data, could you clarify the progress on developing outcome and destination data for higher apprenticeships? Your plan seems to suggest that\u00a0data won't be available until 2020-21, at the end of the programme. eluned morgan am: And that's because we're only just starting on this, and it takes a long time for people to complete an apprenticeship. So, we won't have anybody going from the higher level apprenticeship into a destination until around 2021, so there's no point in measuring that until that point. And then, can you tell us when you'll publish Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol's new operational plan to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, which was presented during July, and clarify if the plan requires additional funding? eluned morgan am: So, there is a report that was published in July, and we are waiting for the operational actions from that report to be published, probably within the next month. In terms of the implementation of that programme, some of that journey has already begun, so they're not waiting for the report to\u2014. We're not waiting for the actions to be very clearly set out; actually, some of that work has been done. I think what's clear, and something that's very much driving me as the Welsh language Minister, is this understanding that you reach 16 and you get this fall off a cliff in terms of the number of people who actually speak and use Welsh. So, that's the thing that we need to address, and that's why moving now into that area of further education is crucial. And the report, written by Delyth Evans, did suggest that we do need to move into this area but, actually, there wasn't necessarily a need for further funding in that area. But it may be something that we will consider, but it's something that we'll try and absorb, perhaps, from within the department. kirsty williams am: A relatively modest amount of money was being made available this year to be able to kick-start some of this work, but we are mindful of the recommendations from the Evans report. So, future allocations will have to reflect the priorities within the implementation plan, and that's not just money that goes directly to y\u00a0coleg, but also trying to get better alignment between other budget lines that support the Welsh language, and making sure that all budget lines that could help on this agenda are aligned to the recommendations and the implementation report. Just on\u00a0coleg cenedlaethol's extended remit, have you had\u2014? I haven't read the Evans report, but is there anything in there about the role of increased use of Welsh in adult community learning, for example? That's a further education pot, isn't it?",
        " eluned morgan am: Yes, it is, and we are very much in touch with adult community learning, and they are aware of the responsibilities they have in relation to the Welsh language. suzy davies am: Oh, yes, I don't mean the higher education sector that's taken over responsibility for this; I'm talking about community learning, low level, just having Welsh there. And, you know, as you mentioned yourself, post 16, people stop using it, so getting it in wherever you can as part of a strategy. They're aware of that responsibility and we\u2014 suzy davies am: They're free to choose partners, then, are they, to help them deliver that? eluned morgan am: And also to work with the new organisation that we've set up to promote the learning of Welsh, in particular, that is based in Carmarthen. So, that's something also that's being driven, and they're working closely, I think, on this. So, for instance, up in Wrexham, if a student has gone into the college to do A-levels, then they may decide to do those A-levels through the medium of English. But if they were previously in a Welsh-medium school, they are actively encouraged\u2014indeed, persuaded\u2014to do their Welsh baccalaureate through the medium of Welsh. So, they may be doing their A-levels in English, but if they've come from a Welsh-medium school, the college proactively seeks them out and makes sure that there is provision for them to do their Welsh bac qualification through the medium of Welsh, or, for instance, they are working very hard to form tutor groups. So, the tutor group\u2014you might be doing your qualifications in English, but your tutor group will be a Welsh-medium tutor group, so that you are placed\u00a0with other students who have come from Welsh-medium schools, and your tutor does all that tutor work through the medium of Welsh. So, there are other ways in which we can continue to help support children's linguistic ability, even if they have made a decision not to formally study their A-levels, for instance, or a course, through the medium of Welsh, and we're constantly looking at new ways. I think one particular aspect of the market\u2014if we call it that word\u2014that we're interested in are those students who've been to Welsh-medium schools, but at 16, perhaps, as I say, decide to go to a college. So, for instance, here in Cardiff, looking at childcare, and the opportunity\u2014you know, there's a sector where we know we need a Welsh-medium workforce. kirsty williams am: So, again, it's trying to target those children, and track them from a previous Welsh-medium education into a college, capturing their language skills, and finding ways in which they can use them. Merthyr college\u2014there's a Welsh-medium champion in Merthyr college actively looking for children who have come from a Welsh-medium background, and they are allocated roles as Welsh-medium champions within the college, to promote. So, there are lots of innovative ways, especially in the FE sector, that they're looking to keep children's linguistic skills relevant, and they're using them, even if they make that decision to switch the language of their tuition. My question was about community learning, where it's essentially older people who perhaps are coming back to education in a way that wasn't as formal as it was before, if I can put it like that\u2014so we don't lose sight of them as well. I've still got an abiding worry that there's a cohort in the middle here of people who we might lose, and maybe pass on bad attitudes towards the Welsh language to their children, despite the fact that those children now have huge opportunities to absorb Welsh language skills and make the most of them. I'd like to ask about the regional skills partnership\u2014partnerships, I should say\u2014because they are having a direct influence now on courses and provision in FE, and with degree apprenticeships in universities as well. You, I believe, received the Graystone review back in March, so could you tell us a bit about what was in it, and what the recommendations are? eluned morgan am: So, some of the recommendations\u2014. He did suggest that, actually, what they need to be producing is much shorter, sharper, focused reports. There was a suggestion of a lack of transparency, in terms of reporting from those regional skills partnerships, and that's obviously something now that we've undertaken to review. And there, I think, is an understanding that what we need to do now is to put in place those changes. But, on the whole, what we've done is to reinforce our commitment to the regional skills partnerships, and in particular now, through allocating \u00a310 million to further education colleges to respond directly to the wishes and the desires of the regional skills partnerships, you can see actually the status of the regional skills partnerships has just grown significantly. So, you've seen quite a dramatic shift, I think, in the respect for regional skills partnerships over the past year. llyr gruffydd am: So, are there any recommendations in terms of governance as well\u2014 eluned morgan am: Yes. llyr gruffydd am: \u2014because, clearly, there may have been concerns about the way that people ended up being members of the partnerships? You touched on transparency\u2014clearly, that's an issue as well. eluned morgan am: So, on governance, I think there was an understanding that that needs to be looked at again, and that we need to get the right people around the table. And what is interesting is, I think, because it was a voluntary approach, because now people can see an outcome, we're getting different people now really showing an interest in being a part of the regional skills partnerships. So, governance is something again we're going to be addressing and following up the recommendations on in that Graystone review. Is there anything to add to that? huw morris: Well, I was just going to say, I don't see why we couldn't share the review with you. llyr gruffydd am: The normal course of action would be, of course, to have published it and then to publish a Government response. Any reason why that wasn't done? I find it quite strange that you're saying that you're actually actioning the report and you still haven't published it. There's nothing to hide here, so why wouldn't we? We're the people who commissioned the report\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: I'm the one asking the questions. huw morris: May I just\u00a0say: we ask a number of people periodically to comment on what we do, and agencies we work with do the same. I don't suppose we'd anticipated there would be the interest in this issue that there is and so, as the Minister said, there's no problem that I can see with that. llyr gruffydd am: And do you have a timeline in terms of by when you want to introduce some of the reforms that you're looking at now, because of this report? eluned morgan am: Some of them have already been introduced, so we're not waiting. The transparency issue that I think there was a bit of concern about\u2014that's already been introduced. So, it's just about making sure that people understand what is going on in these regional skills partnerships. I think that's really important\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Well, quite, given the influence that they have\u00a0now. Just another short one on the regional skills partnerships, really: how effective are they in supporting the planning and delivery of Welsh-medium provision in post-16? eluned morgan am: I think there's more we can do in relation to that. So, if you think about the care sector, for example, what we do need is more people\u00a0who have those skills to speak through the medium of Welsh in the\u00a0care sector. And, coming back to the point that was made earlier, what we're doing now is looking at the curriculum: to what extent can we include\u2014? You don't have to do your whole course through the medium of Welsh, but there are aspects that would be very useful. One of the things that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol are looking at is building the resources that will be needed in order to mainstream those into, in particular, those\u00a0front-line service areas where we have a skills shortage. Cabinet Secretary, you know that\u00a0this committee has taken a very keen interest in the emotional and mental health of our young people. In the summer, the English universities Minister made an announcement about the development of a new mental health charter. Is Welsh Government expecting Welsh universities to sign up to that charter or are you planning to work on your own? kirsty williams am: Thank you for raising this. I think it's really important that whilst for many, many, many young people moving away from home and starting their degree course is an incredibly exciting time and something they look forward to hugely, it can bring significant stresses with it, especially for first-year students, who, as I said, are moving away, perhaps are suddenly responsible for finances in a way they've never been responsible for, for all the day-to-day living that perhaps they've relied on other people to assist them with. So, it is right that we look at how we can support health and well-being for students, especially mental health and mental resilience. So, I very much welcome the work on the mental health\u00a0charter, and HEFCW\u00a0are engaged and keeping a very close eye on what's going on to see the opportunities for Welsh universities to participate in that. But this was on a recent agenda item that I had with HEFCW, and indeed with the\u00a0vice-chancellors, when I met them last week, or the week before last. So, they are developing their own strategic approach to well-being and health for students, which will be underpinned by a co-created action plan with the universities themselves on supporting students\u00a0with mental health problems in particular. So, the strategic approach and the\u00a0action plan are being developed by HEFCW\u00a0at the moment and HEFCW\u00a0are also meeting with colleagues from England and Scotland to see the opportunities for a universal approach across the UK to supporting students. The universities, when I met with them recently, all shared a commitment to do better in this particular area. One, because it's the right thing to do, but, actually,\u00a0stopping people from dropping out and not completing their courses obviously is of a financial benefit\u00a0to the institution. So, it's actually the right thing to do for their students, they want to do it for that reason, but, actually, there is a strong financial underpinning to ensure that students complete their studies. So, it's looking at, again, each university looking at individual approaches of how better they can do that. But it's not just responding to students who become unwell, it's\u00a0actually, 'What can we do to in the campus to maintain\u00a0good mental health?' So, rather than just trying to fix a problem once it's occurred, it's 'What can we do?' And you'll be aware of individual institutions\u00a0taking different approaches. It's not something that we dictate, but individual institutions\u2014when they do exams, how work is assessed and marked and graded\u2014are taking different steps to promote well-being, as well as then responding to situations where students become unwell. We do know that financial pressures can be a source of huge stress for students, so we are constantly working with the Student Loans Company to make sure that the services that they offer to people are as good as they can be, and that there are no unnecessary delays that, perhaps, put a student under pressure or give students worries about their financial situation. And I would argue our Diamond reforms, which allow students\u00a0access to a living wage\u2014for some students, completely by a grant, for some students, a combination of grant and loan, with no expectation at\u00a0all that your parents\u00a0will contribute, which is not the case in\u00a0other places where there is an expectation of parental contribution\u2014that actually, hopefully, addresses some of those financial worries that some students may have. But I am aware that if people are waiting for their grant or people are waiting\u00a0for their payments, that can be a source of stress. Are you able to give us any indication of timescale\u00a0by which you'd expect HEFCW\u00a0and the individual universities to actually have this work in place? kirsty williams am: I'm not sure, but I will write to the committee and let you know. In fact, we can probably provide, from Universities Wales and from the work that's going on centrally, a list of\u00a0proposals that are being undertaken. I wanted to ask you about the pay dispute, and I know that you're not the employer, because\u00a0I know that's going to be the first answer\u2014 kirsty williams am: You're right, that is the first answer. dawn bowden am: But we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly\u00a0in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera, et\u00a0cetera. When we've seen the teachers' pay settlement, we've seen FE settlements in England and Scotland higher than what's\u00a0on the table here. And I am concerned, and I do think this is where the Welsh Government does have a role, because\u00a0I am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff. So, they've walked away from the table, they've said, 'One per cent, take it or leave it. Unless Welsh Government gives us any more money, that's the end of that.' And I'm really concerned about that, because\u00a0this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit\u00a0and retain staff in FE colleges. And I look at the college in my constituency, Merthyr\u00a0college\u2014it's a tertiary college, they're providing A-level education across Merthyr\u00a0and they're astounding results they've been getting as well. It's really: what more do you think you can do as a Government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football? eluned morgan am: Thanks very much for that. I think, first of all, you're absolutely right\u2014this is about ColegauCymru's negotiation, but we are keeping a close eye on the situation. I think it's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about, or part of the reason, is because\u00a0you've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers' pay and we've had the consequential. The people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution, you can understand why they may say, 'Something needs to change here.' The problem here is that it's about that, actually, that falls to the Welsh Government. Or at least it falls to FE colleges to fund that,\u00a0and it's up to them to come up with that proposal. I think it's fair to say that we'll wait until they get further along down the line, but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation. When you say you're keeping a close eye on it, have you actually had conversations with ColegauCymru? Because I note what you just said there:\u00a0'We'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what's happening.' Well, all the unions are currently consulting. , this isn't something we want in the FE sector, clearly, so is there anything more proactive that Government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute? eluned morgan am: Well, we are listening and speaking to ColegauCymru, and also we're aware of what the unions are saying as well. When they come to a conclusion, and when they come to us and say, 'Look, this is the consequence and this will finish'\u2014at this point, we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall. Yes, we wouldn't expect you to make an announcement on this, because it's happening outside of Government, but there is a principle here, isn't there, in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and FE? So, would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect? eluned morgan am: In relation to teaching, I think it's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching, yes. You emphasise\u00a0'in relation to teaching'\u2014my next question is that, of course, within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff, and if there was to be some sort of increase, then would you not expect all staff to have that? eluned morgan am: Well, let's see\u2014that's up to ColegauCymru\u00a0to negotiate and to discuss, so let's see what the outcomes are. llyr gruffydd am: Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid, as well, aren't they? So, you know\u2014. We're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members, and we'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally. llyr gruffydd am: Could I just briefly as well ask about pensions, because that's coming down the line, potentially, isn't it, and the impact that's going to have on FE? One college was saying it will cost them \u00a31 million if it happens next year. Are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them, potentially, because obviously this is coming down the line, really, isn't it? eluned morgan am: Well, I think, already, we've got the situation in relation to teachers, and again what we've seen is the consequential and the UK Government honouring that. Again, what we don't have, necessarily, is that money coming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on. llyr gruffydd am: The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that? eluned morgan am: Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future. lynne neagle am: In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or \u00a310.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position? eluned morgan am: We are aware of their position, yes. hefin david am: You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from\u00a0Professor Colin Riordan\u00a0on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter\u2014it was actually to me\u2014that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give\u00a0me your opinions on that, please? kirsty williams am: I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity\u2014. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put\u2014. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed\u00a0centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites\u00a0that offer to write essays for cash. [Laughter.]\u00a0My understanding is\u2014 hefin david am: Well, they get through the system and they guarantee\u2014. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions\u2014 kirsty williams am: You did. hefin david am: The websites\u00a0say to you, 'Unless\u00a0you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. kirsty williams am: Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself\u2014 hefin david am: Well, I have experience of it. [Laughter.] kirsty williams am: I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did\u2014a student deliberately\u00a0went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. hefin david am: And just\u2014final question\u2014with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action? kirsty williams am: Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. Huw, would you like to comment? huw morris: We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private.\u00a0Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

    [
        "gareth rogers: Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Unfortunately, the Chair is unable to attend today, so in accordance with Standing Order 17.22 I call for nominations for a temporary Chair for the duration of today's meeting. gareth rogers: As there's only one nomination, I declare that John Griffiths has been appointed as temporary Chair. Thank you all very much, and item 1 on our agenda today is introductions, apologies, substitutions and declarations of interest. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far. dr david blaney: Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money\u2014we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.\u00a0We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on\u00a0this and preparing for it. bethan owen: This is based on the UCAS\u00a0applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June.\u00a0The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8\u00a0per cent, which contrasts with a 2\u00a0per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU\u2014so international students, not from Europe\u2014have also decreased by 9\u00a0per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7\u00a0per cent increase in England. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment? bethan owen: The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime,\u00a0are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report.\u00a0But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review. john griffiths am: In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be? bethan owen: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS\u00a0data. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as\u00a0Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come. llyr gruffydd am: Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this? dr david blaney: It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have\u00a0an effect of perturbation.\u00a0That's probably relatively temporary\u2014let's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the\u00a0Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and\u00a0particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family, that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u00a39,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind.\u00a0So, the price sensitivities work quite differently. So, again, if you've got a relatively better invested part of the system, then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive. llyr gruffydd am: That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes. mark reckless am: If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism\u00a0about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications? dr david blaney: Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in Wales at a slightly later point than in England. mark reckless am: But this is non-EU students, and I think you said, Bethan, an 8 per cent or 9 per cent fall in them as well. mark reckless am: All English or all Welsh? bethan owen: Well, I contrasted the Welsh position with the English position where they were seeing growth. If you look, then\u2014and we don't have the detailed information, but, again, what UCAS publish is some analysis by tariff. They analyse by type of institution\u2014in other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions\u2014and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government. mark reckless am: Why would that affect Wales\u00a0more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector? bethan owen: I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others. john griffiths am: Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything? dr david blaney: I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales. mark reckless am: So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think. dr david blaney: I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence. darren millar am: Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market? dr david blaney: I suspect, and this is speculation\u2014I suspect that it's a bit of both. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. darren millar am: But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities? bethan owen: I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data. bethan owen: Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw. dr david blaney: So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales\u2014it's 'Study in Wales'. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of. mark reckless am: What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales? dr david blaney: One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through. darren millar am: I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything? bethan owen: In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions. darren millar am: And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they? bethan owen: They are four plus the current year.\u00a0So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21. darren millar am: And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate? bethan owen: Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting \u00a338 million income from European students, and approximately \u00a391 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income\u2014\u00a31.5 billion\u2014of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions\u00a0have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and\u00a0resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of \u00a317 million. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the\u00a0sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and\u00a0infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace\u2014either Diamond\u00a0funding or the European replacement funding. darren millar am: So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment\u00a0problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've\u00a0seen in recent years because of the\u00a0financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and\u00a0the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes? bethan owen: Yes, that would be fair to say. darren millar am: So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment\u00a0in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you? bethan owen: They are all planning for capital investment. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter\u2014so, we've got \u00a310 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further \u00a320 million. That will make a difference, particularly\u00a0to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and\u00a0expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they\u00a0need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that\u00a0is going to be released to HEIs in the future? bethan owen: I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend\u2014a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is\u00a0the start of the system, and because of cohort protection\u2014so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19\u2014in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year\u2014so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process. darren millar am: But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process\u2014they can't pre-empt a budget process. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds. llyr gruffydd am: Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be\u00a0receiving in income, for example. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or\u2014? What's the plan? bethan owen: I was\u00a0reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector. bethan owen: I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements\u00a0as well. So, we don't really know, then, whether\u2014it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really. dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted. darren millar am: Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out? dr david blaney: There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do.\u00a0And I think, in our submission,\u00a0we identified\u00a0a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with\u00a0Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would\u00a0respond to different scenarios. We are not able to do that here either because, inevitably, they would have varying\u00a0degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very, very carefully. You take cost out, which is essentially the response, you actually take people's\u00a0jobs out, and all of that\u00a0has to be managed carefully. So, that's not really a matter for public consideration, but we do know\u00a0that the institutions\u00a0are looking at a range of scenarios on what they\u00a0would do. Bethan mentioned earlier\u00a0on that the\u00a0current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it's not something that has taken\u00a0them by surprise. They are responding to what they\u00a0see as the dip between where Diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing. Similarly, I think we're comfortable\u00a0that there is a managed approach\u00a0to the scenarios that they're testing within institutions. The bigger issue really, in a public policy context, is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for Wales in terms of research and skills development\u00a0and all the other contributions. darren millar am: So, you're confident that they're taking a robust approach\u00a0to planning\u00a0for various scenarios, going forward, are you, as individual HEIs? dr david blaney: Yes, and as the deal becomes more clear politically, then they will obviously have greater\u00a0clarity in terms of which of these scenarios\u00a0they need to work up more fully, but they are sighted on it. Can I just ask about fee and access plans, and how Brexit might impact them? To what extent\u00a0do you think that they\u00a0could be impacted? dr david blaney: I think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. We, as part of that process, go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And\u00a0also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan.",
        " If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014. We also monitor after the event and, if there are differences, we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences. Conversely, if they'd had more students, and potentially more investment, we'd want to know what they'd spent it on, and if they've done different things, we'd want to understand that as well. The only other thing that's perhaps worth saying is that, in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they're not published yet, so I can't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to Brexit and the Brexit impact, and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues, so they're in there as well. darren millar am: But we've already said, haven't we, that it may be nothing to do with Brexit, this dip in EU recruitment, because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in? But they're making assumptions that it's linked to Brexit, are they? dr david blaney: Not really. There are things they want to do to enhance and to protect\u00a0student mobility, and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment. So, the Brexit conversation between the EU and the UK Government might or might not sustain\u00a0Erasmus engagement, and if it doesn't, then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing. What else do you do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning\u00a0for Brexit? bethan owen: We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment\u00a0of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure\u00a0for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions\u00a0are doing. That group, which is the Welsh Government\u00a0group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government\u00a0as well. mark reckless am: Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do? bethan owen: They are autonomous institutions and ultimately\u00a0their governing bodies are responsible\u00a0for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship\u00a0where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship\u00a0where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. mark reckless am: I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that. bethan owen: I think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see. The big thing in this whole\u00a0Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue. So, there's a relationship\u00a0with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance\u00a0activity, we will challenge. We have an annual cycle, with two points in the year where we reassess the overall risks of individual\u00a0institutions, and that's based on a whole range of hard data but also a range of soft data. We have lots of conversations and we take all of that in the round and form an assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions but also the extent to which we think their governance and management arrangements are properly sighted and facing properly the challenges that they face. In some ways, we say it's not about the challenges they face; it's about how they face the challenges. Our alarm bells really ring when we get the sense that, actually, either an executive or a governing body hasn't really noticed. There are medium-term real challenges, both because of Brexit and because of other contextual factors, but at the moment the sector is a managed sector, which is good. It's not always like that, but we're in, I think, a good place at the moment. So, our role is definitely to challenge where we don't think they are making sensible assessments, but it's not to say that their assessment is wrong and ours is right; it's just to have a conversation\u00a0about, 'Why have you done this and what has informed your thinking?' It's slightly more one step back and slightly more subtle, but it is, as you imply, us using the intelligence we gain from all of those conversations when we talk to individual institutions as well. We had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions, including Cardiff University, and it's very interesting, in relation to Erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments\u00a0to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that. bethan owen: Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. llyr gruffydd am: And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether\u2014and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU\u2014that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive. dr david blaney: I think the\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Sorry\u2014especially if it means that they do more of it. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing that sort of mobility. There are signs that some of the restrictive elements of the Erasmus programme are going to change anyway, because that's under development and that's positive. There have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to carry on being able to access the Erasmus programme. Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed apparently, so we'll have to see on that one. That would be far better, I think, as Bethan indicates, than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only, but you could have a made-in-Wales on top. All of these challenges also create opportunities because they stimulate thinking, and so the fact that seven of the eight universities\u00a0are already now using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this is positive, and I think we can take that on from there. llyr gruffydd am: Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived\u00a0the situation to be. A key\u00a0part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves? dr david blaney: Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils\u00a0in the UK to have a memorandum\u00a0of understanding\u00a0with the National Union of Students in Wales. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests. That is particularly, in essence, around circumstances where a provider gets into difficulties and they might wish to close a course or something more drastic and then what arrangements are in place to make sure that those students who are in train are protected. So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student\u00a0interests in higher education. We're also requiring\u00a0further education institutions\u00a0who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections. llyr gruffydd am: But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may\u2014. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale\u2014that's a UK Government issue. llyr gruffydd am: Is that something that you have a view on? dr david blaney: It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum\u00a0and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries\u00a0in the mix. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm\u00a0just wondering\u00a0what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect. dr david blaney: I think there are possibly\u00a0a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of the student experience\u00a0is the richness that you get from having students in your cohort who have different backgrounds and different perspectives. So, if there is a continuing\u00a0reduction in the number of EU students coming into Welsh institutions, then that richness deteriorates. That doesn't\u00a0mean to say that the base or the threshold standard of what's required for a degree will come under pressure, it's just about the richness on top\u00a0of that, which will be, in a sense, a quality-enhancement issue. That would be something that we would wish to try to protect against, but in the end you can't force EU students to come\u2014you have to try and look attractive, and we've touched on that. The baseline requirement assessment\u00a0of quality will not be affected by Brexit, except in so far as the machinery we use to discharge\u00a0our statutory responsibility, which is through the Quality Assurance Agency, which themselves\u00a0are accredited\u00a0with\u00a0European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, the European machinery\u00a0for higher education quality. And there's a set of standards around that, and we would obviously wish not to be in a position where our ability to use and adhere to those standards is adversely\u00a0impacted upon. Those\u00a0standards will still exist, and it will be possible for the British system to adhere to them, even if they're not actually able to play in the same way. Then the only other thing I would\u00a0say is that one of the factors that can cause\u00a0the quality of the learning and teaching experience to be likely to become inadequate is when institutions come under financial pressure, just because their capacity to maintain the same sort of student experience can get under pressure. So, clearly, we will be looking for and making sure that institutions manage the financial pressures, if there are any\u2014and there are some at the moment, as we've described\u2014and manage those carefully. And in all of that, we will expect institutions to do their duty to make sure that the commitments they've already made to students are carried through. So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course\u2014you can't just pull the plug out. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you. bethan owen: I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme\u00a0Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as\u00a0Diamond is in place\u2014and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have. llyr gruffydd am: Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point? dr david blaney: Do you mean the Brexit situation? llyr gruffydd am: The Brexit clock, yes. dr david blaney: Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I've said several times, the sector is a managed sector at the moment. We're not seeing maverick stuff, but actually you can only manage, really, what you can see and what you can reasonably predict. So, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult that is for institutional management and, indeed, for the rest of the machinery to support them. darren millar am: Chair, can I just ask a question? john griffiths am: Yes, Darren. darren millar am: In terms of uncertainty, though, we've still got this uncertainty over whether the extra cash that the Government's going to have to spend as a result of Diamond being implemented is coming to the HE sector. They've given a political commitment, but you've got absolutely no other assurance of the sums of money that are coming in. We've got the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales, which are also under way, so it's a bit of a perfect storm for you, isn't it, really, with all of these three things happening at the same time? dr david blaney: We're certainly kept busy. darren millar am: But two of those things are in the gift of the Welsh Government to sort out for you, aren't they? dr david blaney: Well, the policy on the reform of the post-compulsory sector absolutely is a Welsh Government policy. The extent to which they can pre-empt a budgetary process and give us clear sight of the amount of money in future years is\u2014. My understanding is that that's difficult for them to do, and I would repeat what I said earlier: officials have been as helpful as I think they can be in respect of that. , you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. darren millar am: that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck? dr david blaney: No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so\u2014. darren millar am: No, but there have been opportunities\u2014repeated opportunities\u2014in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's\u00a0been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing. dr david blaney: Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to cause significant perturbation, either to the timeline of that or to it coming in at all, then there would be much more of what Medwin Hughes calls 'houskeeping' that would be required, and that would be significant. So, at the moment\u2014I don't like the expression 'valley of death', but there is a valley to cross, and I think the sector is reasonably confident about how wide and how deep that valley is. So, there are several valleys that they're crossing\u2014the metaphor fails, doesn't it, really, but I think you get the drift? So, there are a number of challenges and they can see their way out of some of those challenges, but if any one of these starts to get significantly disrupted, then that would be a real issue for them. Could I go on to ask about other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are? dr david blaney: Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one\u2014and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful\u2014is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit\u00a0in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. , STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM\u2014it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further\u2014so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils, making sure they're in the various committees and so on. We are intending to do a bit of work to see if we can systematise that a bit better\u2014that engagement\u2014because there's no doubt about it: it's not to say that this system is in any way inappropriate, but the more you're in the conversations, the more likely you are to be better placed to respond to the research challenges that come up. One final question: in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist, do you see potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those, and are there any particular lessons to learn from\u00a0S\u00ear Cymru II? dr david blaney: I think that there are two things to say here as well. First of all, the Brexit deal might or might not impact adversely\u00a0on the capacity of Welsh and, indeed, UK research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across Europe, and, in a sense, that's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like, and we'll have to wait and see. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. It's not just the money, it's being in the club and it's the signalling that we're in the game. And then the other part of my response to this would be that, actually, Wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does, so maintaining the quality, maintaining the impact, and hopefully growing\u00a0the critical mass. The S\u00ear Cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that, because it's been very focused, capturing key research players, and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them, and to industry collaboration, and they have been areas of real strength that we've invested in. And I think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market. darren millar am: Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have \u00a3100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is\u00a0obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be\u00a0particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales? bethan owen: One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding,\u00a0because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. darren millar am: But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places. bethan owen: There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. darren millar am: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every \u00a31 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another \u00a34 on top, because that \u00a31 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash\u2014. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a\u00a0flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got\u00a0institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves\u2014they're running at a loss. darren millar am: So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both? dr david blaney: I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash from wherever they can, so I don't think it's a lack of appetite. Well, thank you, both, for coming in to give evidence to the committee this morning.\u00a0You will be sent a draft of the transcript, to check for accuracy. Okay then, the next item is item 3, papers to note, the first of which is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education\u00a0on the school organisation code. The second is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget\u00a0for the forthcoming financial year, which we will be discussing under item 6 on the agenda. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behaviour. And\u00a0the final paper to note, paper to note 5, is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care\u00a0on the children and family delivery grant, which we will discuss later on in private session, if Members are content. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting, and also for items 1 and 2 of the 20 September meeting"

        " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "professor a: We 're not recording yet , are we ? grad g: Well , I don't think phd f: No , that that wasn't recorded . phd f: I guess I have to d stop doing this sigh of contentment , you know , after sipping cappuccino or something . phd f: I was just noticing a big s professor d: So are we recording now ? Is this phd e: Yeah . professor d: So , what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ? grad g: I think that phd e: It 's a good idea . grad g: u usually we 've done that and also we 've s done digits as well , but I forgot to print any out . Besides with this big a group , phd b: You can write them on the board , if you want . I it 'd be even better with this big grad g: it would take too much time . phd e: Mari ? postdoc h: What professor a: What ? professor d: It 's not that long . professor d: w u phd e: So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . professor a: It 's kind of professor d: Oh , yeah , the element , yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .",
        " professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate .",
        " You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off "

        "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call the meeting to order.  Welcome to the third meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Pursuant to the order of reference of Monday, April20, the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements, allowing members to present petitions, and questioning ministers of the crown, including the Prime Minister, in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand there's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the Canadian Armed Forces who lost their lives last Wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of Greece. Colleagues, we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. As we do, Canadians, like everyone around the world, are doing their best to live their lives until things improve. Meanwhile, as we look towards the future, I believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history. Andrea McCrady, is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands by the Canadian Forces. In May 1945, Canadian Forces played a major role in liberating the Dutch people from Nazi occupation. May 5 is now a national holiday in the Netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries. Let me remind you that, as in the House or in committee, members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings, I will outline a few rules. If you look at the bottom, you have a little flag that indicates whether it's English or French, and that's how we will be speaking.  I would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions.  In addition, to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous Parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. It includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person's consent. The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. I want to remind all the members that there are specific headsets that have been mandated to all of us. If you don't have one, please talk to your IT ambassador and they will get one to you as quickly as possible. The reason for them is not so much for what you hear, but that our interpreters are working and there are work conditions that really make it difficult. Part of that is not having the appropriate boom on your headset, which will make it very difficult for them to hear and interpret for our members. The petitioners have noted that there are approximately 60 indigenous languages in Canada and that 2019, last year, was declared by the UN to be the year of indigenous languages. They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16. Fundamentally, they call upon the Government of Canada to recognize indigenous languages as being official languages of Canada and to have each language recognized nationally, with implementations on regional and provincial levels, acknowledging that many regions have different languages. Chair, I am proud to present a petition on behalf of one of my constituents, Myles Lynch of St. Myles lives with cystic fibrosis and has had three lung transplants in the last five years, and he's only 22 years old. One thing Myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program. I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system. Chair, I'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton, Ontario, who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have signed similar petitions. Given that Canadians are living through unprecedented, catastrophic climate events, and at the same time our society, as you know, is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of Canadian families are only $200 away from insolvency in any given monthand particularly given the pandemic that we are currently experiencing, these petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support motion M-1, a made-in-Canada green new deal that I am presenting in front of the House of Commons. It calls on Canada to take bold and rapid action to tackle the climate emergency, and to put in place a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. Chair, it's an honour to table a petition on behalf of constituents from CourtenayAlberni. Over 12,000 Canadians have died over the last four years due to fentanyl-poisoned sources. They cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted in the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl. They are citing that regulating to ensure safe sources, with proper measures and bylaws, will reduce the criminal element associated with street drugs. They are calling on the Government of Canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the Emergencies Act. They are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source. Chair, I'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of Canadians in my riding with the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities. The petitioners in MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on providing the Canada Border Services Agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively. I would like to remind honourable members that no member shall be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. I want to again remind honourable members to use the boom on the official headsets so that everything runs smoothly, not only for ourselves but also for the interpreters. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. justin trudeau (prime minister): Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country. However, I would like to know whether he considers that, with this order in council, organized crime, street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons. We are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities, to strengthen the control at our borders, and to implement other measures. member speak of those measures, because we are going to work together in the House to strengthen gun control. I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released. justin trudeau: The protection, the safety and the health of all Canadians are important for the government. This is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected. We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. pierre paul-hus: So is the Prime Minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience COVID-19 within the walls? right hon. justin trudeau: There are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released. Is Canada going to stand by its allies in the Five Eyes and demand that the Chinese government be completely transparent? right hon. justin trudeau: We continue to stand in solidarity with our allies, including the Five Eyes, as they have stood in solidarity with Canada in terms of the two Canadians who have been unjustly detained for a long time in China. In the coming months and years, we expect to obtain answers to all our questions about the origin of this pandemic, including questions that are important for China. At the same time, we are going to work hard to ensure that all Canadians have the equipment and the protection they need to get through this pandemic. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. For some days, discussions have been going on between people from the Bloc Qubcois and people from the government with a view to collaboratively coming up with a proposal for seniors in Quebec and Canada. The gist of our proposal is to temporarily increase the old age security by about $25per week, or $110per month. The discussion has been going on for some time and it's a proposal that we made in the election campaign. Given that impatience, I realized I should not be the one answering them, it should be the Prime Minister. So here is my question for the Prime Minister: what are you doing to seek a solution that will increase the purchasing power of seniors in Quebec and Canada in the very short term? right hon. justin trudeau: Clearly, seniors need support and significant services from us because of COVID-19. Our priority was to implement income replacement benefits for workers who have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. The most vulnerable seniors are going to receive reimbursement of the GST, which will help them very quickly. We have also channelled $9million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors. I am very pleased that we have been able to work with other parliamentarians, including those in the Bloc Qubcois, to hear these concerns and to find the best way to help seniors in the short term. In terms of the pandemic, they have concerns about their physical security, but also about their financial security. yves-franois blanchet: In the last few hours, the Prime Minister has indicated that he could need the cooperation of other parties, including the Bloc Qubcois, on a completely different matter. We are very open to that discussion, but we want the same openness when we are asking for something to serve the people of Quebec. Seniors in my constituency, as in any other of the 338constituencies, are asking what we are doing. When will there be something for them? I want to be able to give them an answer of some kind. justin trudeau: There will be announcements in the coming days on the way in which we will be able to help seniors, particularly the most vulnerable seniors. There are horror stories, whether about the CHSLDs, or about our most vulnerable seniors across the country. There are seniors who are alone, seniors who are afraid of falling ill without ever seeing their grandchildren or their children again. We have to be there for those who belong to that great generation that fought for us during the second world war. Chair, every day I hear from people who are struggling to pay their bills and to keep a roof over their head. Instead of making sure that Canadians get the help they need, the government has created complicated programs that are still letting people fall through the cracks. If the Prime Minister won't commit to a universal benefit, will he at least commit to removing the restrictive eligibility criteria that are leaving the most vulnerable people behind? right hon. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. That is why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. However, because she didn't make $5,000 last year, when the pandemic hit she didn't qualify for any benefits. Chair, our focus throughout this crisis has been on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures that will lift Canadians out of poverty and will support them. Over the past five years, we've lifted over a million people out of poverty in this country, and we've continued to put the most vulnerable at the heart of everything we're doing. At the same time, we will continue to look for more ways to help even more than the seven million Canadians who successfully receive the CERB. We recognize there's more to do, and we will continue trying to do everything we can in this unprecedented situation. Chair, the government is weirdly committed to eligibility criteria that result in regular people not getting the support they need, but not so committed to criteria for corporations and billionaires who get our help. If a company is cheating the public, using offshore tax havens not to pay its fair share, it should not be eligible for government bailouts or benefits. Other countries, like Poland, Denmark and France, have made this commitment, and if they can do it, so can we. Will he commit now that if a company has money in offshore tax havens, it will not receive public funds? right hon. Chair, the measures we've put forward are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for. It is a shame to hear the NDP, which used to be the party of workers, choosing to judge workers by which multinational they work for. We have moved forward with a wage subsidy such that the employers are obliged to pass every single penny on to the workers. That is help for the workers, and that has been our focus all the way through: ordinary Canadians who need support because they are unable to work because of COVID-19. I want to remind honourable members that we're trying to stay within committee rules, which state that the length of a question and the length of an answer should be approximately the same amount of time. She has about 45 seconds left, and hopefully that's about half and half for the question and the answer. My community was facing a crisis long before the pandemic hit, and now people who are living on the streets or in parks don't have the luxury of following public health advice and just staying home. In Victoria, the province and the municipality have stepped up with solutions to house people, at least for the short term, in local hotels. Will the federal government respond to this immediate crisis and provide the needed investments in long-term, stable housing? the chair: The right honourable Prime Minister, in 25 seconds or less, please. Working with partners, we have reduced poverty by over a million people in this country, but there is more to do. We recognize that during this pandemic there's even more to do for vulnerable Canadians, and we are partnering with orders of government to make sure that happens. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): A point of order, Mr.Chair. Could we please check so that I can hear in French what the Prime Minister is saying? the chair: Okay. I'm speaking English right now and I'm on the English toggle at the bottom of the screen. It does create a bit of a disjoint when we're speaking, but it's the way to get around that so we have interpretation that works for everyone. Chair, as this is our first opportunity to meet in any forum, I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of the brave men and women who lost their lives in the helicopter crash. I know that I speak for all parliamentarians when I extend our sympathy to their families and loved ones. Chair, I want to raise with the Prime Minister an issue that I've raised several times before, and that is a gap in the wage subsidy program. Those companies separately would qualify for the wage subsidy, but because of rules that the government designed, together they do not. Even though collectively they have experienced a massive drop in revenue and would otherwise be eligible, so far they've been unable to get confirmation that they will be able to access the program. Will the Prime Minister be able to deliver some good news to people who work for Brandt Tractor all across the country? right hon. justin trudeau: I thank the honourable member for his question and for his advocacy for his community and businesses in his riding. As I told him when we spoke directly, Finance officials have been directly in contact with the company in his riding. We recognize that there are particular elements in regard to this company that are challenging around application for the wage subsidy, but I know that Finance officials are working very hard to try to make sure that everyone who needs the subsidy gets it, so that the workers in his community can get the support they need. andrew scheer: The Prime Minister knows that there are many companies across the country that fall into this category as well, so we're hoping for some good news. Just flagging the time and date, it is well into May now and important decisions have to be made in very short order. There are other aspects of the government's plans to help get people through this crisis that are also causing people to fall through the cracks. As provinces start to open up, many companies are going to be faced with a very difficult decision of operating at perhaps 35% or 45% of regular revenues. They will not be able to access these programs and, in many cases, there is going to be a disincentive to reopen and put people back to work. Will the Prime Minister amend these programs to provide for more flexibility so that more and more Canadians can start to return to work in the weeks ahead? right hon. Chair, we are in an unprecedented crisis and we had to move quickly to support workers and to support families across the country, and that's exactly what we did. We're going to continue to work to try to respond to the reality that people and businesses are facing right across the country. I am eager to be faced with the challenge of how to ease off in these measures so that people can get back to work. We are still focused very much on giving the supports to workers and families that are so necessary in this time of crisis. As different provinces move forward towards reopening, as we look at different paths forward, I know that I will be able to count on all members in the House and, indeed, on Canadians from coast to coast to coast to figure out together what the best way will be to move forward on keeping us safe and restoring economic activity in the right way. the chair: We have about a minute left for maybe a 30-second question and a 30-second answer. The problems with them have been flagged for the government for weeks as well, but we're also going to see an additional challenge, where people who are receiving the emergency response benefit, who may have the option to go back to work and work some hours, are faced with a hard cap of $1,000 a month before they lose the CERB. Conservatives are proposing a progressive system, a more flexible system, where people will be able to earn more without losing their benefits as businesses ramp up but before normal working hours are restored. Again, will the Prime Minister build in some flexibility to lift the restrictive ceiling on what people can earn before losing benefits so that it always pays more to work? the chair: I believe the timer is telling all of us that the time is up, but I'll give the right honourable Prime Minister about 30 seconds to answer that, please. Our priority was getting support for Canadians right across the country with the CERB, with the wage subsidy and with other measures for students, for seniors, for farmers and for agricultural producers. We are going to work with communities and with industry as we look to reopen, to make sure that people have opportunities to work and are not penalized for it. However, our overarching priority was allowing Canadians to be confident in their ability to stay home, care for their loved ones, buy groceries and pay their rent so that we could keep safe during this pandemic. We've heard the Prime Minister admit that fixed incomes for some of them are down, rent is increasing and the price of groceries is increasing. Chair, after a lifetime of hard work, of course Canadians deserve peace of mind when it comes to their retirement security. Happily, their pensions and their benefits are still flowing, unlike for so many of those who have lost their jobs, but it's still tough. People received a GST credit, a supplementary payment that was $400 on average for single seniors and $600 for couples. I think you had reminded us as members that the amount of time for the answer should be similar to the amount of time for the question. the chair: I want to remind all honourable members to keep their answers as well as their questions as concise as possible. We see a number of inconsistencies in what is considered essential travel with regard to the U.S. While we have Americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish, individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined. We have people who have purchased masts from Canadian producers for their boats, and who want to come and pick them up, who are not being allowed to do that. When will they clarify the rules to the CBSA agents so that essential travel and trade and commerce, including individual commerce, is understood? hon. Chair, we have implemented very rigorous rules that have been well documented and understood by CBSA to stop all non-essential travel. At the same time, we recognize the importance of maintaining essential supply routes so that goods and services could reach Canada and we could put groceries on our shelves. The work we are doing to stop non-essential travel has been important for the health and safety of Canadians, and we will continue with that work. We see that many of them are not eligible for any of the benefit packages that have been rolled outEI, CERB, the wage subsidy, etc. What is the government going to do to address sole proprietors who are currently falling through the cracks? hon. Chair, first, let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult. The intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge.",
        " We are looking at ways that we can ensure that the Canada emergency business account has the broadest possible application. We are looking at ways we can consider that eligibility process, recognizing that we need to make sure that the program continues to have its desired impact, and we will have more to say on that. Since then the minister has overruled the will of harvesters in Prince Edward Island and in the gulf who voted to start their seasons on time, but she has allowed harvesters from her own riding to proceed with their seasons as scheduled, giving them access to markets weeks before their competitors. This double standard is severely unfair and Atlantic harvesters are furious, as demonstrated during the protests on the Canso Causeway yesterday. When will the minister stop abusing her position and start respecting fish harvesters by opening up lobster fishing areas 23, 24 and 26? hon. Chair, when making decisions with regard to when seasons open, a number of factors are taken into account. They are complex decisions that take into account what is necessary for processors to be ready for the season, what is necessary for harvesters to be ready for the season, as well socio-economic impacts on the area. In the decisions we've made around the gulf, one of the main things we heard from all of those areas is that it was very important for them to start on the same date. Maybe I'll start muting if it's necessary, but interrupting is not going to solve anything. West coast fishing tourism is a key economic driver in British Columbia, especially in coastal communities, and yet the public fishery gets no respect from the government. A year later, the fisheries minister refuses even to discuss viable, science-based solutions to conserve B.C.'s public fisheries. Does the minister and her government have a will and a plan to support Canada's west coast fisheries and the communities they sustain? the chair: The hon. That's why we continue to work with those communities and with the fisheries to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to support them. During these extremely difficult times, we're working on measures with the fishery in B.C., as well as on the Atlantic coast and eastern Quebec, to make sure that we're delivering for them and that all of the issues they're having are being addressed. Chair, Canada's seniors, especially those on basic incomes, are being hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis as they face new rising costs and scarcity of services. Seniors require adequate caregiver supports, physical safety and freedom to access their savings to reinforce their financial security. Why has the government failed to recognize the increasing challenges that seniors are facing? Will the government support Canada's senior citizens? the chair: The hon. We have provided a GST credit supplement of $400 for single seniors and $600 for couples, for low- and modest-income seniors. We have also ensured that the Canada emergency response benefit is there for seniors who have lost income due to COVID-19. On April 23, my colleagues and I called on the government to create a program that would match students seeking employment with employers in Canada's essential food supply chains. What has the government done to match students and other Canadians seeking employment with employers in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, including those in the fish and seafood sector? hon. Chair, we're doing all we can to make sure, using our existing employment programs, that we create opportunities for students to work and get work experience this summer. We know that this is going to be really tough, especially in areas like agriculture, so we have dedicated streams for agriculture sector employers to access students with help from the government, and a number of different initiatives including Canada summer jobs, which I'm really excited to see the results of in the coming days. Arnold, it's the second time that I note you've threatened to cut off a Conservative microphone. I'm just wondering, given that this isn't the House of Commons and it's structured as a committee, what standing order would give you the right to cut off a member of Parliament using a mute button. It seems a little dictatorial, and I was just wondering whether you could clarify that, based on the Standing Orders. the chair: I don't think I threatened to use mute, but thank you for bringing that up. I am trying to keep the rules where the questions and the answers are equal, so that there are no interruptions on either side. Bring the papers with the actual verbiage on it where I threatened, and we'll go over it, but I don't think this is the venue to do that. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Canadians have outrightly expressed outrage and disappointment with the government's initiative to put a gun ban in place. Does the minister stand by his comment that these changes would have prevented the tragedy in Nova Scotia? the chair: The honourable minister in 15 seconds or less, please. bill blair: We have heard from health professionals, women's rights organizations, victims groups and the police and our unions. They're all very supportive of the government's measure to ban weapons that have no place in a civil society and were designed to kill people. rachael harder: It's interesting that the minister is misleading Canadians in that comment because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has actually said that a gun ban will do nothing of the sort, that it actually will not protect Canadians. How many criminals will see guns seized because of the changes that have been implemented by the Liberal government? hon. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles. The chief in Toronto said that taking those assault rifles off the streets contributes to public safety, and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs has declared that military assault rifles are produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and they urged successive governments to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles. Absolutely no criminals will see their guns seized based on the Liberals' legislation that's coming forward because it actually goes after those who legally own and use their firearms. Can the Prime Minister please tell us why he decided to go after law-abiding citizens instead of actually going after criminals who have gotten their firearms in an illegal manner and then used them to commit crimes? the chair: The honourable minister in 25 seconds or less, please. bill blair: Yes, to be very clear, the order in council actually is targeted at weapons, weapons that were designed for military use, and in their design and in their intent, to kill people, they've actually been used in this country, at cole Polytechnique; in Moncton; at a Quebec City mosque; in Fredericton; at Mayerthorpe and most recently in Nova Scotia. They are being used and have been used in Canada and around the world to commit mass murder, and in the interest of public safety and at the urging the chair: We'll go on to Ms. Now I understand the Prime Minister has his food prepared for him at 24 Sussex Drive and then it's delivered to him at the cottage where he lives. Now, they're in a crisis right now, which means that regular Canadians are actually at risk of not having food available for them at the grocery stores where they purchase theirs. Why doesn't the Prime Minister care about the women and the men who work incredibly hard to keep Canada fed? hon. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. member that our government cares very, very much about the women and men who work so hard to feed our country. Let me just say I am grateful to all the farmers, like my dad, who are out in their fields right now getting ready for seeding. We, as Canadians, are lucky to be citizens of an agricultural superpower, and our government believes in supporting our farmers and ranchers. rachael harder: I'm confused as to why the Prime Minister didn't take my question, and at a bare minimum as to why the agriculture minister doesn't feel it's important enough for her to be a part of this discussion today. When we have farmers who produce for Canadians on a daily basis and they're asking some serious and some very important questions, and we don't even have a minister who's willing to come to the table and engage in this conversation, that's shameful. Several meat-packing plants have been forced to shut down because of COVID-19 and, as a result, farmers are forced to hold stock longer than expected. Cattle producers in my region are spending more than $60,000 a day to keep their livestock fed while they wait for processing plants to reopen. When will the government take this seriously and at least implement a set-aside program for those who are beef producers in Canada? hon. Chair, let me just say that I feel there is nothing shameful at all in having me, the Deputy Prime Minister, answer questions about agriculture. I am actually very proud to speak up for Canada's amazing farmers, for our country's amazing ranchers, for our amazing pork producers and our poultry producers. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Mr. I too would like to express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the six military heroes who lost their lives at sea last week. I'm sure that all members of the House stand shoulder to shoulder with the families, with the crew of the HMCS Fredericton and, indeed, with the entire Canadian Armed Forces community during this time of grief. Can the Minister of National Defence give us an update as to the Cyclone helicopter crash off the coast of Greece last week? hon. Our number one priority is to make sure that we look after them, and that's exactly what we are doing. I actually spoke with the Italian minister of defence and he promised full support for this investigation and any support that's required. the chair: I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut you off there, if we're going by the rules that were pointed out by the House. I know that back in early January, military intelligence through CF Intelligence Command was reporting, through the chain of command, the novel coronavirus and the outbreak in Wuhan. On what date was he, as Minister of National Defence, given his first intelligence briefing on the outbreak and the pandemic in China? hon. We work with our Five Eyes intelligence sources and this has been a whole-of-government effort, right from the beginning. Obviously, I can't discuss the intelligence in this forum, but I can assure you that our response has been well informed with the correct information. james bezan: Minister Sajjan, we know that intelligence was going up the chain of command in National Defence. It was reported in the media that in early January the hierarchy within the Canadian Armed Forces was being made aware of the coronavirus outbreak. As with all our intelligence, we work together from a whole-of-government perspective with all of our intelligence agencies. One thing I can assure you is that our response has been well informed with all the correct information that is provided to me and other members of cabinet. james bezan: What was that timeline? From the time you were first told, Minister Sajjan, about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, what did you do with that intelligence? When did you give it to the Prime Minister or to Minister Hajdu as the Minister of Health? hon. Chair, let me say that our government's response to this global pandemic has of course been informed by the excellent work of Canadian intelligence agencies throughout. In January, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the incident response group, and in January we increased screening at all major airports. All of these actions were informed by the work of our excellent intelligence community, and of course our work with our Five Eyes, NATO and NORAD allies. james bezan: I want to come back the chair: We now move to Mr.Ste-Marie. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Can I go ahead, Mr.Chair? the chair: Yes, go ahead. In an interview with Grald Fillion, tax expert Andr Lareau, who specializes in tax havens, pointed out that $350billion Canadian is parked in just 12tax havens. Mr.Lareau also notes that the government is aware that all of this Canadian money is stashed in tax havens but is doing nothing about it. He said that it's time for Canada to tackle the problem given that it has a $250-billion deficit, and that if it doesn't act now to change things, it never will. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, as soon as we took office, in 2015, our government made cracking down on tax evaders in Canada and abroad a priority. I realize that my fellow member is impatient, but he has to understand that this is a very complex issue. Under our leadership, in three years, the Canada Revenue Agency has undertaken twice as many audits related to offshore tax evasion as it did in the 10years the Conservatives were in power. As we speak, the agency is conducting more than 50criminal investigations tied to international tax evasion. gabriel ste-marie: You're right, I am very impatient, because whenever I bring up the fact that companies are using tax havens legally, the minister misses the point and tells me that she is going after fraudsters. Since Parliament began sitting virtually, it's been mentioned a few times that Denmark and Poland have decided to deal with the issue. Even France's finance minister, Bruno LeMaire, said that companies with subsidiaries in tax havens would not be eligible for public assistance. We hear thePrime Minister and other government officials say all the time that the wage subsidies are going to workers, so I'd like to cite another examplebanks. The government is injecting huge amounts of cash into the financial system and repurchasing troubled assets in massive quantities, and yet, the five major banks in Toronto, alone, are continuing to save billions of dollars every year by artificially redirecting their profits to tax havens. This has nothing to do with wages for workers, and everything to do with the repurchase of troubled assets, cash flow and billions of dollars that the government could be going after. Is the government going to seize this opportunity to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal? hon. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, our government is taking unprecedented steps through the Canada emergency wage subsidy measure to support businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. What's more, any employer receiving the subsidy who is deemed ineligible will have to repay the full amount. Anyone who abuses the program could face a fine of up to 225% of the wage subsidy amount and up to five years in prison. the chair: Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds to ask your question, and about the same for the answer. Although completely immoral, the use of tax havens by companies is legal under section5907 of the Income Tax Regulations. We are going to have a $250-billion deficit to pay off, and everyone is going to have to chip in, including the rich who are currently taking advantage of the system. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, thanks to a historic billion-dollar investment, our government has given the agency the resources it needs to do the job, and we are starting to see results. I'm proud of how the Government of Canada has been beside Canadians through every step of this pandemic and has supported Canadians when they needed it most. In BonavistaBurinTrinity and across our country, our commercial fishery has seen many challenges and impacts. Last week, my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing Canada's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process, store, package and distribute healthy, high-quality products on to the plates of Canadians. The fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures. Chair, I want to thank my colleague from BonavistaBurinTrinity for keeping us well aware of what's happening in his riding with harvesters and with processors. It's the backbone and the lifeblood of our communities and that's why we want to be there to support them. We've already taken steps by making sure that the CERB is now able to be accessed by people who are seasonal workers. As well, we are making sure that people who are running out of fishers EI are also able to qualify for it. We also have made an investment of $62.5 million to support our processors to make sure they are able to be ready for the challenges that they are going to face because of COVID-19. We are working with our partners across industry to make sure we're hearing what their major concerns are. We will have more to say about that and what we will be able to do in the coming days. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all the chair: We have a point of order. damien kurek (battle rivercrowfoot, cpc): Sorry, but there seems to be an issue with the audio. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all vantage points in the supply chainfrom manufacturers to retailers, transport companies to warehousing. With provinces and territories moving at different speeds and implementing different protocols for reopening the economy, there is a lot of confusion in my local business community on the timing and logistics of how this will happen. With so many different parts of the supply chain operating in different jurisdictions, and with each business serving unique roles on this spectrum, how can the federal government serve to best coordinate with the provinces and territories so that the supply chain can be implemented smoothly as we embark on our economic recovery? hon. One of the most important things the federal government can do when it comes to the reopening of the Canadian economy is to work in close collaboration with the premiers of the provinces and territories. That's why I was so pleased that last week the Prime Minister, together with all the first ministers of the country, was able to issue a statement around the principles that will be guiding our entire country as we move towards a restart. This is so important because, as my colleague has pointed out, all of our business, our economic activity, happens across the country. We have been able to work together in fighting coronavirus, and we are going to work together in the future to keep on fighting coronavirus and to reopen Canada. In Alberta, meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 cases. The government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with COVID-19. Now, two workers are dead, at least six more are in intensive care and COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities. On March 27, regarding the CERB, the Minister of Finance said that if workers don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, they can apply for the benefit, yet the website says differently. Will the minister guarantee that every Canadian receiving CERB, EI or the CESB will not lose their benefits if they refuse to return to work or to accept work that is unsafe due to COVID-19? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me thank the member, first of all, for her really very important question. I think all of us share the concern for Canada's essential workers who are keeping us safe, putting food on our tables and often working in difficult conditions. When it comes to the Cargill plant, this is an issue that our government has been very closely engaged in. My colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has spoken with her provincial counterpart and the head of the plant. To the question my colleague asked about workers, it is absolutely the case that no Canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe, and it is also very much the case that any Canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home. This is the way that collectively we take care of ourselves and we take care the chair: We will go on to Ms. heather mcpherson: I just want to be clear, because I'm not a hundred per cent sure that I got an answer in that response, so I'll try one more time. Knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work, can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work, they will be able to access the CERB, or was the Minister of Finance incorrect when he spoke on March 27? the chair: The honourable minister. chrystia freeland: In a time of coronavirus that is even more the case, and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair to avoid back and forth, just to try to keep some order in the meeting. If the provincial government won't shut down the plant, will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the Canadian Food Inspection Agency? hon. Chair, on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, let me be very clear that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has been in touch with provincial authorities. The duties of the food inspection agency, of course, are to ensure that the food produced at the plant is safe. We are working closely with provincial authorities and with health authorities to ensure that the chair: We will go back to Ms. Can the finance minister please let us know if Cargill, a company that is owned by billionaires, with business in Luxembourg, a known tax haven, has received any federal funding this year for COVID-related support? hon. diane lebouthillier: This is a tough time for Canadians, and our government is doing everything it can to support them. More than 7million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit, which the Canada Revenue Agency and Service Canada administer. I want to say how proud I am of the work the agency is doing; staff worked tirelessly to get the program up and running in record time. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Potato farmers in New Brunswick and across Canada are sitting on massive stores of potatoes that were destined for the restaurant industry, but due to the pandemic, they now have no customers. What is the Prime Minister's plan for the helping farmers offload these potatoes so that they are ready for the 2020 season? hon. We are aware that the coronavirus, by keeping us away from restaurants where we eat french fries, has had a profound effect on the market for potatoes. The program announced today by the Prime Minister and my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be very helpful for potato farmers, including with the surplus food program that starts with a $50 million fund, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. With an estimated $300 million worth of potatoes in storage, the announced funding from the government today simply doesn't go far enough. How does the Prime Minister plan to mitigate these shortfalls and allow farmers to continue to grow the food we so desperately need? hon. The program today is $252 million, which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers, of course, have access to. On potato farmers, in particular, I agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern. I think all Canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used, and that's why the $50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful. The $16-billion beef industry is expected to take a massive hit due to the closures and reduced production of the meat-packing plants. Does the government truly believe that the announced $125 million that is shared between beef, poultry and pork producers will be enough to support these multi-billion dollar industries so they can put food on the tables of Canadians? hon. Chair, I absolutely agree with the honourable member that our beef, pork and poultry producers are absolutely essential for our country. I am very pleased as a Canadian that we have security that comes from being a country that produces not only enough food for ourselves, but also enough food to feed the world. That is why the $125 million specifically to support our beef, pork and poultry producers is going to be so helpful. Chair, the government's announcement of $252 million for the agriculture sector falls well short of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's request for immediate government relief for farmers. The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Mary Robinson, put it today something like this: that if the farmhouse is on fire, the government has offered the equivalent of a bucket of water. Does the government have a plan to offer more than just crumbs to keep the vital agriculture sector operating and providing the food we so desperately need? When will the government finally make those who literally keep our land and grow our food a priority in this time of crisis? hon. Chair, I don't know about the honourable member, but where I come from, $252 million is not just crumbs. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two other aspects of the essential support for farmers that we announced today: the $77 million to support food processors, which will not only be important for the processors, but helpful for the farmers who produce products that go to them; and the $250 million that we would like to add to the Canadian Dairy Commission's line of credit to raise it to half a billion dollars, which will be very helpful to our essential dairy farmers. Chair, a couple in my riding has had to shut down their business, and they are on CERB.",
        " They were shocked when their 16-year-old son also qualified, and he is receiving $8,000 on the basis of part-time work throughout the school year. Why is the government handing out a windfall to teenagers who are living at home while denying university students and ignoring seniors on fixed incomes? hon. Chair, any individual who has lost work for COVID reasons is eligible for the CERB, regardless of their personal circumstances. If you made $5,000 in the past year and are a resident of Canada, you qualify for the CERB. This is not a matter of differentiating between the personal circumstances of individuals but of acknowledging that many workers in different situations have lost their work or have had their work significantly reduced because of COVID. cathay wagantall: Clearly, high school students would not have the same needs as university students and our seniors who are suffering at this time. The government's own findings on banning handguns and assault firearms state, In all cases the data does not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to reductions in gun violence. Why is the Prime Minister so bent on penalizing law-abiding firearms owners when he should be focusing on funding our CBSA officers first, giving them the resources they need to seize smuggled firearms at our borders? hon. Chair, I note with some interest that when we brought forward legislation in a budget in the last two years to increase the number of officers at the border, the member opposite voted against it. The evidence is overwhelming that these weapons are designed to be used, and have been used, to kill innocent people. Countries that adopt sensible gun policiesplaces like New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdomhave all recognized that there's no place for these weapons in a civil society. There have been far too many people killed with these weapons, and even most recently, to honour and respect the terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, the time to act is now, and we've acted. cathay wagantall: Last week the Minister of Agriculture said, Step by step we are giving our farmers...the tools they need to continue their...work. On April 30, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture called on the minister to create a $2.6-billion fund to maintain food security in Canada. This morning, the Prime Minister announced $252 million, hit-and-miss, across the agriculture sector. With all due respect, this is a slap in the face to our farmers and the agri-food sector. If the deputy minister is going to answer the question in her place, how does she see it is right to be providing $9 billion to students and only crumbs to our agriculture sector? hon. Chair, first of all, let me say I do not, as has now been suggested by two members opposite, consider it in any way shameful that I should be answering questions about our support for the agricultural sector. The $252 million of support is real and meaningful, and it is directed exactly where it is needed. As to the question about students, let me just point out that farm kids are students too, and farm kids will be benefiting from the support for students. Meat packing plants like Quebec-based Olymel are extremely worried that they won't be able to stay open throughout the pandemic. In the summer, these plants rely on students to do overtime and fill in for full-time employees on vacation. However, the Canada emergency student benefit makes it possible for these much-needed workers to stay home while still collecting the same amount of money. That's why the government must adjust its current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors. carla qualtrough: I can assure you that we are doing our best efforts to not disincentivize work. We are looking at ways we can create additional jobs through Canada summer jobs, through the the chair: There is a point of order. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, what the minister is saying is not being interpreted. carla qualtrough: Last week, as part of the measures announced around supporting our students, we announced the creation of 76,000 additional jobs, including jobs in the agriculture and processing sectors. This is exactly what we're doing through our youth employment and skills strategy, and that's what we'll continue to do. richard lehoux: I'm not sure the minister understood my question about the Canada emergency student benefit. I am very concerned about the agricultural sector, but the tourist and horticultural sectors are also on my mind. A number of business owners in my riding have reached out to me because the shortage of student workers is forcing them to shut down for the summer. Minister, what do you have to say to those business owners in the tourist and horticultural sectors whom you are not helping? hon. We've heard very clearly from the students that they want to work and want to serve in their communities in this time of crisis. That's why we're creating additional employment opportunities and an income support mechanism that allows them to work. Pork and beef producers are feeling the impact of the country's shutdown triggered by the pandemic. For the past five years, the government has been saying that the programs to help producers will be improved. When will the government make these changes, including the changes to agristability, and when can producers access them? hon. chrystia freeland: We announced over $77 million in assistance for food processors to help them protect their workers and deal with the costs associated with the coronavirus. To help livestock and pork producers, we established agrirecovery, a national initiative that will provide $125million to help producers adapt to market changes. The measures announced at noon today received a very cold reception from the entire agriculture and agri-food sector, since the sector had asked for about $2.6billion. I think that it's important to support our agri-food industry and our farms, given the significant need for sovereignty. Many Canadians in the agriculture and agri-food sector have made this clear, as I was saying earlier. chrystia freeland: Our country, Canada, will never depend on its neighbours or any other country for food. I want to mention another significant part of our announcement today, which is the $50million surplus food purchase program. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We'll now move on to the next question. blaine calkins (red deerlacombe, cpc): Madam Chair, how will the government's forced confiscation of law-abiding firearms owners' property prevent criminals from illegally acquiring firearms from the United States? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, in response to that, I would simply remind the member that we have made it very clear that these weapons have no place in civil society, so we have prohibited military-style assault weapons that have been designed to be used to kill people and have been used to kill people. We'll bring forward new authorities, new offences, new penalties to deal with people who smuggle weapons across the border. We're also bringing in new regulations for the storage of weapons to make it more difficult for people to steal these guns. To deal with people who purchase them illegally and sell them illegally, there will be new offences and penalties to make ensure that they face the consequences. blaine calkins: The government previously has said that decisions like classifying firearms should be left to experts. A legal opinion that's already been obtained says that the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun with the choke removed is in excess of 20 millimetres. That is the same firearm that Olympic trap shooters, Olympic skeet shooters, duck hunters and geese hunters all across our country use on a very regular basis. First of all, we have prohibited large-bore weapons, such as grenade launchers, but with reference to the 10-gauge shotgun and the 12-gauge shotgun, I would simply remind the member that the bore of a 10-gauge shotgun is 19.69 millimetres in width and the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun is 18.53 millimetres in width, both of them under the size for prohibition and therefore not covered in the new prohibitions that the government introduced on Friday. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, the opinion is that of one of the foremost experts we have in Canada when it comes to firearms legislation. If the entirety of the barrel length is considered, then the removal of the choke makes that barrel in excess of 20 millimetres. There is no plan for a buyback program in this policy, and law-abiding firearms owners are not able currently to surrender their firearms. Given this, and the fact that law-abiding firearms owners aren't committing any gun violence, what was the government's immediate benefit of making this announcement on May 1? hon. Along with the prohibition that we have put in place, we have also, using the order in council, established an amnesty period, but the amnesty period is non-permissive grandfathering of those weapons. They cannot be used, they can't be taken to the range for shooting, they can't be used for hunting, they can't be sold and they can't be transferred, so we have put in strong measures to ensure that these weapons will not be available for use. We have also put in an amnesty period that will allow us to bring forward the legislation and a budget in order to effect a responsible, safe and effective buyback program to remove these weapons from society. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, since January 1, 2002, any law-abiding citizen who was issued with a firearms licence by the government would have been cross-referenced with a continuous eligibility check 6,695 times up until May 1 of this year. How many times was this most recent mass murderer here in Canada checked against a criminal database since January 2002? hon. bill blair: As the member is probably aware, there is a very extensive investigation currently being conducted into that individual and how he acquired his firearms, and it's not appropriate to discuss that. However, I think what is appropriate is to recognize that the weapons that this individual had available to him are weapons that were not designed for target shooting or hunting purposes or any sporting purposes. In the hands of someone who is intent on mass murder, they represent an unacceptable and deadly risk to Canadians, and that's why we have prohibited them. I'd also remind the member that other countries that have adopted sensible gun control laws, such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, have also implemented very similar bans. I'd like to start by giving my condolences for the crew from the HMCS Fredericton who died, and in particular to the family of Captain Kevin Hagen. Other countries are strongly recommending that all citizens wear masks wherever people gather indoors, including in schools, on public transit and in stores. Taiwan has effectively stopped the spread of the coronavirus by supplying people with masks and installing dispensers of hand sanitizer throughout public spaces. Taiwan started in the top 10 countries affected by COVID-19, and today it is number 119. Will Canada follow Taiwan's example so we can lift the lockdown safely and get Canadians back to work? hon. patty hajdu (minister of health): Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I thank the member for his question. There's no doubt that masks can play a role in a layered approach to protecting Canadians' health and safety, but as the member has mentioned, there are many other aspects to ensuring that Canadians are safe no matter where they go. Social distancing can provide the most protection, in fact, when you're out in public or you're in another place where there are other people. Tam has said that when physical distancing is not an option, Canadians should consider wearing a mask. I'd like to give a shout-out to Martha and her team, who are doing a fundraiser for the SPCA by making masks for citizens in my riding. Madam Chair, many people are falling through the cracks in the pandemic relief plan, including seniors who face an increase in the cost of living and a loss of retirement investment income. Will the government make the CERB a universal benefit to ensure that all Canadians who need help get help? If not, will the government increase old age security and allow seniors to withdraw funds from their RRSP without penalties so that they can pay their bills? hon. We do recognize that OAS and GIS are very important parts of the retirement income of Canadians, particularly lower-income seniors. The CERB is there for working seniors who have lost income as a result of COVID-19. We've also reduced the mandatory retirement withdrawals by 25%, and we've also spent half a billion dollars to support organizations that assist vulnerable Canadians, including seniors the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Many small businesses do not meet the eligibility requirements for the various relief programs on offer, particularly sole proprietorships. At the same time, we have large companies in this country that use tax havens and loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of public services. Will the government ensure that the needs of small businesses are met and withhold relief from corporations that use tax havens to avoid paying taxes in Canada? hon. mary ng (minister of small business, export promotion and international trade): I want to thank the hon. That is why we have implemented many measures to help them weather this difficult period in COVID-19. Whether it is a small business loan, a wage subsidy or commercial rent assistance, or just lowering the cost by deferring GST or HST or customs duties, many measures have been put forward to help our small businesses through this very difficult time. As we navigate this pandemic crisis, we are also in the middle of another major crisis: the climate emergency. Will this government develop its economic recovery plan for the pandemic with the climate emergency at the forefront of its planning? the acting chair (mrs. The focus of the government at the present time is on combatting the virus and on steps to start to relax some of the measures that have been taken. As we look forward, we need to learn from the experiences of this crisis as well as look forward to some of the looming crises on the horizon. Climate change is one of those, and we certainly intend to reflect on resilience for the economy as we move forward. niki ashton (churchillkeewatinook aski, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. First nations across northern Manitoba and many others across the country have been doing everything possible to keep COVID-19 out of their communities. Many here have implemented strict lockdowns or travel restrictions, but the federal government has done virtually nothing to deal with the chronic issues that have made them vulnerable in the first place, such as overcrowded housing and the lack of hospitals. What is your government doing to support communities in the face of that possibility? Why isn't the government supporting the call for a ventilation centre in Berens River, a hospital in Cross Lake, a hospital in the Island Lake region? If the government couldn't act in time for this first wave of the pandemic, can it at least act in time for a potential second wave? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Indeed, Madam Chair, one of the reflections we have in coming out of this global pandemic is that we don't want to go into the next one with the same social determinants of health that have made indigenous communities more vulnerable and more susceptible to contracting and then spreading COVID-19. A lot of the historic housing funds that we have mobilized in order to address overcrowding in particular are cold comfort to those communities that are still finding themselves in overcrowded situations. In the staged approach to the epidemic and the onset of COVID-19, there are many measures that Indigenous Services Canada and as a whole of government we will deploy, including surge capacity, increased PPE, and nurses and doctors. Obviously, we are looking for a medical solution to a medical problem, and that is what we will spare no expense or resource to address as indigenous communities continue to face the looming threat of a second wave of COVID-19 as they start to relax some of their confinement procedures. niki ashton: Again, Madam Chair, to the Minister of Indigenous Services, many of us across northern Canada are deeply concerned by the outbreak taking place in northern Saskatchewan, centred in La Loche. Your government says it's committed to doing everything it can to keep first nations safe, yet nothing has been done to support calls for pandemic shutdowns. Will you support first nations in their call for shutdowns during this pandemic to save lives now? hon. Members won't be surprised to know that that number will only increase as the days go on and as we implement aggressive testing and contact tracing. We are working with surrounding first nations and communities and with the Mtis and Dene communities in La Loche to ensure that medical precautions are being put into place and that strict social distancing is being put into effect. This is a situation that is very much evolving minute by minute, and it is something for which we have deployed additional resources, along with Meadow Lake and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority to ensure that there is a health response to a health problem. marc miller: One of the things we see as we see the evolving dynamic and the potential spreads, particularly the fear of clusters as communities, provinces, territories may choose to relax certain measures, is the need to have a more targeted approach as to how the economy reacts and deals with it, particularly in northern and vulnerable communities. This is something for which we will need to have a serious approach, with both the Minister of Natural Resources and also our provincial counterparts, to make sure that we aren't taking hasty measures to reopen the economy while we're trying to protectand this is our most important goalindigenous communities from getting exposed and spreading COVID-19. Hundreds of fishers and their families here in Manitoba who work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation are desperately calling for emergency support. Many are calling on the federal government to also work with them and the FFMC to redirect their product to domestic markets and communities here at home to address the growing food insecurity people are facing. When will your government announce support for inland fishers, including here in Manitoba, and will you work to ensure that their product, healthy fish, can be provided here at home for people who need it? hon. bernadette jordan: Madam Chair, we know that COVID-19 is having extreme impacts on northern first nations communities, especially with regard to fisheries in areas that rely on it for not only their livelihoods but also for the cultural importance. Indigenous harvesters are able to access through the aboriginal financial institutions the $306 million we've put in for support for indigenous small and medium-sized businesses. The funding allows for short-term interest-free loans as well as for non-repayable contributions. We also announced earlier that the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency has made available $15 million in non-repayable support for businesses. We know that there's more that needs to be done to support our first nations communities as well as our harvesters. I don't want to talk about the $1billion that the government used to track down tax cheats. I want to ask the minister why she isn't taking this opportunity to learn from countries that are putting an end to tax avoidance in tax havens, a legal but immoral practice in this day and age. Can she explain why she isn't showing leadership by convincing cabinet to change course and eliminate the legal measure known as tax avoidance, which enables companies to avoid paying taxes and put money in tax havens? hon. diane lebouthillier: MadamChair, as soon as our government took office in 2015, we made it a priority to crack down on tax cheats. Our government's historic investments of almost $1 billion have ensured that the agency can access the necessary resources for its work. claude debellefeuille: MadamChair, does the minister realize that she's being filmed and recorded and that she isn't answering my question? I don't want to talk about cheats. I want to talk about companies that use a legal mechanism to avoid paying taxes and to put their money in tax havens. Can she tell me how many companies legally take advantage of tax avoidance in tax havens? How much money escapes taxation through this legal mechanism? The government could invest this money in its economic recovery post-COVID-19. Regarding tax evasion abroad, our leadership made it possible for the agency to conduct twice as many audits in three years as it conducted in 10 years under the Conservatives. However, I don't understand the government's lack of willingness to eliminate this mechanism, which is legal but completely immoral. The Fdration de la relve agricole du Qubec and the UPA approached the Minister of Finance two weeks ago and still haven't received a response regarding the following issue. As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account. To qualify for these loans, the farms needed a payroll of $20,000 to $1.5million in 2019. Does the Minister of Finance plan to respond to the farmers who want to access the $40,000 in loans? hon. The tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis, yet despite the Prime Minister's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed Canadians who work in tourism, there's still been nothing from this government. I had the chance to talk to many of the leaders in the sector, and clearly there's a lot of anxiety. We also had the chance to work with all the G20 ministers of tourism all together, and we know we have to act the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Tourism-based communities like the ones in Banff and Canmore, which I represent, are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85% or higher. They also don't qualify for a lot of the programs because they're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from May to October, so they're at risk of losing their entire season. Will the government consider making changes to the programs to make sure that seasonal businesses can get help? What does the government plan to do to help the tourism industry recover after the pandemic? hon. Obviously, the tourism sector has access to many measures, including the CEBA account, the $40,000 account. They will be having access also to funding through the regional development agencies, and we'll be coming up with the details soon. Of course, in my colleague's riding of Banff, which is a fantastic place and a tourism gem, they will have access to the support through WD, western economic diversification. If there are particular cases you would like to raise with me, I would be more than happy to talk to you to see how, on the ground, we can help the tourism operators. It doesn't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they'll have after the pandemic. Another industry that's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry. It's another industry the Prime Minister has promised to help, but there hasn't been anything. The only so-called assistance there's been to help hurting Albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in. Will the Liberal government ever show any concern for Albertans? Will they bring forward a plan to preserve Canadian jobs? Will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of Canadian oil before oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. Chair, the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry. We have the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which covers 75% of an employee's wages for the employer. We have more liquidity for oil and gas companies through new loans of $15 million to $60 million from the Business Development Bank of Canada. We continue to step forward in our response to the impacts of COVID-19 on my province here in Newfoundland and Labrador and on Alberta and Saskatchewan. These three provinces are being hit by two crises at the same time, a crisis of demand for oil and gas on the world markets and of course a crisis of public health with COVID-19. Chair, a lot of these things we're hearing about aren't going to actually help the industry to recover. Maybe what they could do is consider expediting the approval of billions of dollars of private sector projects that would put thousands and thousands of Canadians back to work. Will the government consider looking at ways that we can expedite projects? Will they look at ways that we can encourage the use of Canadian oil before the use of oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. We have been working with labour, concentrating on workers and concentrating on the companies that support those jobs to make sure that they remain whole and those jobs will be there for those workers. We're particularly proud of our orphan wells program, which was launched by the Alberta government in conjunction with us. I am pleased to inform this House that the uptake on applications for that program is significantly higher than even we expected"

What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight .

Do you want user interface: So , you said  are are we starting with the the project manager: Yes . user interface: so will you maybe start with like the  the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th  things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and industrial designer: Okay . project manager: user interface: marketing: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? project manager: industrial designer:  marketing: It's a bit  phallic . project manager: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? industrial designer:  so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . project manager: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that user interface:  yeah . marketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? user interface: Yeah , . user interface: yeah , but  one thing we actually kind of  forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: so we said the back side round , yeah . marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . project manager: user interface: So so  the user interface as as we discussed last time   on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . user interface: So we have that n  channels here starting from   one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . user interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . It's it's quite standard  place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . user interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . user interface: And and we would also have a l little  thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . user interface: On the side , marketing: Ah , you did get that in then , user interface: this one . user interface: And and and it's it's on the back is  cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . user interface: See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen project manager: Yeah . user interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen  the middle button . project manager: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you marketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . industrial designer:  on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . user interface: Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? project manager: But if you hold it in , industrial designer:  . marketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? project manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? marketing: Okay , cool . user interface: So I think it project manager: And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . user interface: Yeah , I think  we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: project manager:  it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . project manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but  we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer: project manager: and cut some of the prices that way . marketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .  you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Is that right ? marketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . marketing: Well , I thought we'd  kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? project manager: Yeah , just prepare one now . What do you all say ? industrial designer: So ? project manager: I reckon it user interface: S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing: Yeah . Okay   what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager:  we can if we industrial designer: I can I can take note   marketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . marketing: Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? project manager: Yeah . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer:  the the only thing that we were considering was that  this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager: I think it does .  industrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left  scrolling with your finger . user interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a  another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . project manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem , marketing: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . user interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so they just marketing: Yeah , but  because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , because  anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing: Yeah . user interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's  project manager: marketing: So  that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . marketing: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? project manager:  marketing: What do you what do you all think ? industrial designer:  . user interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , project manager: Yeah , I think I think for  user interface:  . project manager:  most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager: They industrial designer: so it opens on the side . industrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether user interface: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . user interface: Yeah well yeah , project manager: The length is gonna be difficu user interface: but it's it's a bit long . marketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer:  this this kind of  makes it more project manager:  . marketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? industrial designer: No , we have a locator . project manager: No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface:  that you stick on T_V_ . user interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to  to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . If   if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager: Yeah . user interface: and it's I th I think it's project manager: I'd say six , 'cause the  the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . marketing: Yeah , and  d industrial designer: And  even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology project manager: So industrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager: Might be industrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but  it's a good technology ,  once they get used to it . project manager: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . marketing: So , should we maybe say f a five industrial designer: So l marketing: and say it is intuitive , project manager: Five ? marketing: but it's different , so , do you know ,  it's obvious how to use it , project manager: Yeah . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ?  intuitive but Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . marketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? project manager: marketing:  okay , cool , E_ , okay .  I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . user interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's kinda industrial designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . marketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager: Well we've banned them from marketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager: industrial designer:  yeah . industrial designer: And moreover it it has  L_C_D_ and everything , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just project manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . industrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah , user interface: Technologi well industrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . Well  we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . marketing: Yeah , but  you don't project manager: All of the components have been used in other things before . marketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . project manager: What do you reckon , five , six ? marketing: Yeah , what do you all think ? user interface: Six . marketing: Six ? user interface:  how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: Well , that's it ,  user interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , but  everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? project manager: marketing: So , I don't think many peop project manager: Space remote . user interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? project manager: industrial designer: The carrot banana remote . marketing: So , we give it seven , and we write user interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . user interface: What's the assessment ? marketing: So , we need the average here , so we got user interface: The average is about six and something . marketing: So we've got four sevens , user interface: No , wait , a little bit under six . project manager: Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . project manager: Six point point industrial designer: Fifty one divided by user interface: Six point something , yeah . project manager: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . marketing: project manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? marketing:  no , that's it , project manager: That's it ? marketing: yeah . marketing: user interface: project manager: Computer no signal ? industrial designer:  I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . project manager: It could be marketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . project manager: it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . user interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . project manager: We we're definitely going to have to user interface: We have pushbuttons , industrial designer:  . project manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've user interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer: No  we we have  yeah . user interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel project manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface: Okay , let's yeah . project manager: marketing: haven't we ? project manager: I think the pushbutton oh . marketing: 'Cause then you have project manager: I don't know if that's one marketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Push what  industrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit ?  . project manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we user interface: We have to count all of them , or yeah . industrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing: Well it doesn't , but it  project manager: No . industrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . marketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? industrial designer:  and the locator also goes away . marketing:  does project manager: What else does it need ? user interface: Well the speaker  the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . project manager: Yeah , okay , so we industrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . marketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause project manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . We could do industrial designer: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in  in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . user interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton  we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . industrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ project manager: That's with the L_C_ industrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? marketing: Yeah . marketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager: It's nothing n marketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . project manager: Yeah , marketing:  the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but project manager: I have industrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . marketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? industrial designer: project manager: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . project manager: and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , industrial designer: We have , yeah . industrial designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . marketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , industrial designer:  yeah . marketing: and the scroll wheel is  essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . user interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . industrial designer: project manager: Tha user interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the industrial designer: marketing: Oh the the beeper thing . project manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .  we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,  so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . project manager: Feedback ? Ideas ? user interface: Yeah  , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . industrial designer: I think  n one thing that was lacking  was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . marketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . project manager: But in terms of the process of  going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . marketing: so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s project manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah , project manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office . industrial designer: that's it's it's project manager: They great ? industrial designer: I wonder what one of these costs . project manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? marketing: I don't think you should say that was the recording . project manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , marketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the marketing: Yeah . marketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . We could make some little user interface: But yeah , but  already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . marketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? industrial designer: project manager: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . project manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? user interface: To express them   industrial designer:  . user interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and project manager: Yeah . marketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . user interface: Yeah , neither neither do I , project manager: user interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . marketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , project manager: Banana remote . Vibrate user interface: marketing: Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . project manager: well within budget , including a little what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? user interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . industrial designer: I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and  yeah . project manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . industrial designer: We certainly are , project manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . marketing: project manager: It was very productive day and marketing: We could draw animals on the board again . industrial designer: user interface: Oh , you don't like anim marketing: It's just minging . project manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . industrial designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? project manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not . project manager:  presumably I have to marketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? project manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really "

        "But  we 're gonna try to make this an abbreviated meeting cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it , so . Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera and grad h: Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ? professor b: OK . grad h:  phd d: I g grad h: as a somewhat segue into the next topic ,  could I get a hold of  the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ? postdoc a: Certainly . So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there . grad h:  and then just we 'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made . professor b: OK , wh phd d: I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've  just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them . phd d: but the other ones phd f: That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on . postdoc a: These are separate from the ones that phd f: As soon as postdoc a: these are phd f: They 're the IBM set . And so as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK grad h: Is my mike on ? Yeah . phd f: and we get the transcript back and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them , then  we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch , postdoc a: Excellent . grad h: And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ? phd f: Yes , exactly . phd f: We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . grad h: Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , phd f: Yeah . grad h: Right , which  So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the THISL tools are there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool . So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for  conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting , phd f: What what kind of  what does that look like ? The string that you type in . phd f: What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? grad h: Keywords . grad h: Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like format for everything . professor b: And then does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ? grad h: right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools , professor b: Yeah . grad h: but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have two tools that have already been written . grad h:  the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end for Broadcast News professor b: Yeah . postdoc a: I Can I ask a question ? So  as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play . So e Are you So you 're adding like  , I don't know ,  are they fuzzy matches or are they  ? grad h: It 's a sort of standard , text - retrieval - based So it 's  term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring . grad h:  and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that . So it it 's postdoc a: It 's a lot more sophisticated than the  the basically Windows - based grad h: i it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that . grad h: So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents . Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search . grad h:  you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that . And so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it well  to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings . grad h: So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that . phd f: So what does the user see as the result of the query ? grad h: On which tool ? phd f: THISL . grad h: The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK phd f: Yeah . grad h:  you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits and you can type on them and listen to them . professor b: Mmm phd f: So if you typed in \" small heads \" or something you could grad h: Right , you 'd get phd f: get back a   something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred grad h: something You you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" . It 's too bad that that couldn't come into the grad h: You couldn't get a video . phd g: Guess who I practice on ? postdoc a: At some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is , that keeps coming up . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable  demo sort of format . grad h: And so I think there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally phd f: That sounds really neat . grad h: and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .  Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it . And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working . grad h: If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the THISL IR , the information retrieval tool 's  , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris . phd f: But you were saying that that the  that there 's that set of tools , Cygnus tools , that grad h: So . grad h: But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer , professor b:   phd f: And you have to have all the o grad h: But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't and  different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that  it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows . professor b: How about having it run under free BSD ? phd e: Well what you need grad h: Free BSD would probably be easier . phd e: All you need to do is say to Dan \" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf \" and it 'll be done in a day . phd d:  phd e: Right ? grad h: Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore phd e: Right . professor b: So grad h: I 'll check at that professor b: But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it . phd e: What I phd f: How does it play ? grad h: Yeah , right . professor b: If he has then you learn , if he hasn't then he 'll do it . So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with   , SoftSound guy ,  postdoc a: It 's amazing . professor b: Tony Robinson ? phd f: Tony Robinson ? grad h: Do  Tony ? I guess I do . grad h: Which one do  ? phd e: Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ? professor b: No . grad h: so that 's all going pretty well , professor b: Assuming we 're phd e: Right . phd f: What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ? grad h: I think we 'll be OK with that . phd e: Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ? They 're both Tcl interfaces . grad h: Well this is one of the reasons This is the one of the reasons that I 'm gonna have  Dave Gelbart Gelbart Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff phd e: Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality and it 's grad h: Yeah , yeah , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack . Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts  eh you know , from speaker to speaker . grad h: And if it doesn't phd e: Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ? grad h: Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so . It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on . grad h: but professor b: The thing I was asking about with , free BSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in free BSD than to get this other package running in grad h: Yeah ,  we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , professor b: Yeah . grad h: so   My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system . grad h: It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different . grad h: So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier . So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about  some other stuff which would basically be  showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but  ,  and part of that was showing off what the speech - non  nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like . postdoc a: Can I ask one more thing about THISL ? So with the IR stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized  ? grad h:   phd g: So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody  work that Don 's been doing . phd g:  actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries . professor b: Well I think at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that phd g: I don't know if that would be of interest or not . professor b: cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point phd g: Yeah . professor b: pointing at something I don't know much about , phd g: you 're looking at this now professor b: so . phd g: Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ? grad c:  yeah I 'm starting to and  Yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on . phd g: Yeah def professor b: S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month phd g: I professor b: and then that 'll give us a week or so . The end of phd g: Oh , the end of this month or next month ? Oh , you mean like today ? grad h: This month . professor b:  that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to  to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , phd e: Exactly . phd g: Yeah if d if Don can sort of talk to whoever 's professor b: Yeah . phd g: cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research , visualizing what these features are doing professor b: Yeah . professor b: so  , you know , to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing . professor b: So that 's phd g: I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data so it might be neat , you know . So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools . So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .  it works with Transcriber but it it 's a pain to use it in other tools  because it doesn't mark start and end .  , but I 've installed XML tools of various sorts in various languages and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files , either  information on users because the user database is that way I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m  various inf  sorted information on individual meetings grad c: Cool . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable . Is do we have the the seat information ? In in the Key files now ? postdoc a:   grad h: The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which postdoc a: Ah . phd g: Oh in For the new one grad h: it 's been recorded , phd g: OK . phd g: I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ? professor b: Yeah . phd f: how how w eh where is it in the Key file ? grad h: Right . phd g: Cuz  I haven't been putting it in and in by grad h: You haven't been putting it in . postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits ? professor b: Some of these are missing . phd g: And professor b: Aren't they ? postdoc a: Isn't it always on the digits forms ? professor b: Some fall out of phd g: Well it grad h: Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have . phd g:  they 're on th right , these , but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files . phd f: Yeah I I never phd g: And I don't think Chuck was either phd f: I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file . phd g: cuz grad h: I had told you guys about it phd f: Oh really ? phd g: Oh , so we 're both sorry . grad h: but phd g: So grad h:  this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text phd g: OK . grad h: I think it 's Edit - key , command Did I show you guys that ? phd d: Yep . phd f: You mentioned it , grad h: I did show it to you , phd f: yeah . grad h: but I think you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" . grad h: Yeah , and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings . grad c: u grad h: Yeah and then the other thing also that Thilo noticed is , on the microphone , on channel zero it says hand - held mike or Crown mike , phd g: Yeah . phd g: maybe I forgot to d phd f: Takes me no time at all to edit these . grad h: Yeah that 's cuz you kn phd f: I 'm not doing anything . phd g: And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , \" oh what did Chuck do , OK I 'll do that \" . grad h: And then  also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" . Oh  also I 'm working on another version of this tool , the the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected . And it 's not quite ready to go yet because  it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because the best quality ones , the Crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking . So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out . grad c: Will that also include like batteries dying ? Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically . phd f: But with the screensaver kicking in , it phd d: But grad h: Now phd d: y yeah . grad h:  the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on the thing . postdoc a: It would be nice if if these had little light indicators , little L E Ds for grad h:  buzzer .",
        " grad h: \" Bamp , bamp ! \" professor b: Small shocks postdoc a: Yeah . Oh grad h: OK , disk backup , et cetera ?  I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup and he pretty much said \" yeah , you could do that if you want \" but he thought it was a bad idea . In fact what he said is doing the manual one , doing  NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up . grad h: And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup . professor b: Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's not gonna if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups . But he said that that we sh shouldn't worry too much about that , that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w probably OK . professor b: Really ? grad h: And  , so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and  recording meetings . professor b: So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ? grad h: Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable . professor b: Well I was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had  phd e: I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ? grad h:  unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain . grad h: Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure . And second of all the the write - once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last . grad h: So I think burning them for distribution is fine but burning them for backup is not a good idea . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ? I wanted to ask , I know that  that Thilo you were , bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ? And I wanted to know is th phd d: Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , postdoc a: It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . grad h: Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically things 'll just work . phd d: Yeah it Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but it 's solved . Does this mean that the that this could be por  ported to a Think - Pad note or some other type of  phd d: Yeah , basically  I did install it on my laptop and yeah postdoc a: Wonderful . CrossPads ? CrossPads ? grad h:  got an email from  James Landay who basically said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \" So he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them and asks them if they 're still using them . professor b: Once ? grad h: We we used them a couple times , postdoc a:   phd f: Them ? There 's more than one ? grad h: but postdoc a: Yeah . professor b: But grad h: My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway so I 'm not gonna use it ,  and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with . postdoc a: And I have  so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand , I the down side for me was that I think the pen is really noisy . And I and I don't know if it 's audible on the but I I sort of thought that was a disadvantage . I do take notes , I could be taking notes on these things and I guess the plus with the CrossPads would be the time markings but I don't know . phd d: what is a CrossPad ? professor b: So it 's it 's  it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position . grad h: And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things . grad h: But I don't take notes , professor b: And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because  we were interested in in higher - level things , grad h: so . professor b: not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ? And  I think that was one of the things , phd d: Yeah . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe , have somebody  take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting . And then we did it once or twice and we sort of grad h: Yep , and then just sort of died out . professor b: probably chose the wrong scribe but it was It 's  phd g:  grad h: Yeah that 's right . postdoc a: u but I guess the the other thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and taking notes in some other interface . phd f:  we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ? postdoc a: Oh it 's la it 's useful , grad h: Because that 's summary . phd g: I think there 's also there 's this use that phd f: Summarize it from the transcription . phd g: the Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna phd f: Doodle . phd g: get the summary of the transcript from this time location like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X and But in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content , they could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . I know we haven't been using it but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods grad h: Right . professor b: I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later phd g: so . professor b: and and and put some kind of summary or something  you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing , not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important . But then you don't you don't have the time reference  that you 'd have if you had it live . And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , professor b: Yeah . phd f: How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ? phd g: so . grad h:  that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the CrossPads and so that means synchronizing the time phd g:  postdoc a:   grad h: You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery postdoc a: Well when when I d grad h: and so you postdoc a: OK . grad h: so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used , so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to download to an application , and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information . phd e: Why grad h: And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which postdoc a: There is an alternative . grad h: unless someone postdoc a: There is an alternative , it 's still , there 's  you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c  , I when I when I did it I synchronized it by voice , by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone grad h:  . grad h: Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end phd e: Right . grad h: which someone has to listen to that and find that point , postdoc a: Yeah , it 's transcribed . phd g: Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h  is there a big cau grad h: We can keep all both of them for the whole whole year . phd g: just just in case we grad h: it 's just phd g: even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate  f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out . professor b: Well one thing that we might try  is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else , we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . professor b:  part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in  the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes and grad h: Yep . professor b: and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it . The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with  quibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to   routinely use it ,  it just hasn't happened anyway . But maybe if we can get a person to phd g: Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be a useful , neat part of the project that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute . phd e: Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card . And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server and  phd g: So what kind of input would you be ? phd e: so so , if you 're not worried about grad h: Buttons . phd g: You 'd just be pressing like a a phd e: Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it . phd e: if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort , a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go . grad h:  for what what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else , phd g: M right . grad h: right ? You have the phd g: I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech maybe somebody will be interested in this and postdoc a: I like this PDA idea . professor b: where like one one button was \"  - oh \" and then another button was \" that 's great \" and another button \" that 's f \" phd g: Or like this is my \" I 'm supposed to do this \" kind of button , postdoc a: Yeah . phd g: Yeah something like that or postdoc a: And then grad h:  I think the CrossPad idea is a good one . grad h: It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .  that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it 's been a lot of extra work for me phd g: Yeah . grad h: and postdoc a: But it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d a digital record too , phd g: W postdoc a: doesn't it ?  grad h: Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that is not particularly standard . postdoc a: But  , say , if i if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ? professor b: No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information , postdoc a: OK . postdoc a: I I guess what I 'm thinking is that the PDA solution you h you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a  professor b: Right . You don't have to phd e: The transfer function is less errorful , postdoc a: Oh , nicely put . phd g: Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually , right ? That 's why we have this little I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it and so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year I don't know . grad h: Well w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it . The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ? professor b: So we have no but  by I I would suggest you return one . phd g: We c professor b: We have some aspirations of using them phd g: One would probably be fine . professor b: and phd g: Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .  if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more professor b: Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed . grad h: although there is a little phd g: Well , I 'm yeah , that 's not a bad professor b: Yeah , yeah . phd g: Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which sounds funny but I think it should be cool , professor b: Yeah . phd g: You 're you 're gonna tease me ? grad h: Oh , equipment . grad h: And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that  the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field . professor b: You know what he means but isn't that funny sounding ? \" We ordered more wireless . \" It 's like wires are the things so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing . phd g: I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,  it 's like It 's great . professor b:  there 's there 's all this stuff going on  between  Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs   recognition runs , trying to figure things out about the features but it 's it 's all sort of in process , so there 's not much to say right now . grad h: So just the transcript number and then the then the phd e: This is Yes , this is number two for me today . professor b: See all you have to do is go away to move way up in the phd e: Oh . grad h: Should we do simultaneous ? phd g: Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ? professor b: Yeah . phd g: You have to plug your ears , by the way  Eric , grad h: Well I have to , phd d: You don't have to "

        "Item 2 this morning is the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill: Stage 2 proceedings. I'm pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government; and Emma Gammon, lawyer for Welsh Government. As I said, the purpose of the meeting is to undertake Stage 2 proceedings on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. For these proceedings, Members should have copies of the marshalled list of amendments, the groupings of the amendments for debate and the voting order for the amendments. The marshalled list of amendments is the list of all amendments tabled, marshalled into the order in which the sections appear in the Bill. The order in which we consider amendments will be the default order\u2014that is, sections 1 to 3 and the long title. However, the order in which they're called and moved for decision is dictated by the marshalled list. Members will, therefore, need to follow the two papers, although I will advise Members when I call them whether they're being called to speak in the debate or to move their amendments for a decision. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair I will move amendments in the name of the Deputy Minister. For expediency, I will assume that the Deputy Minister wishes me to move all of her amendments, and I will do so at the appropriate place in the marshalled list. Deputy Minister, if you do not want a particular amendment to be moved, please indicate to me at the relevant point in proceedings. In line with our usual practice, legal advisers to the committee and the Deputy Minister are not expected to provide advice on the record. If Members wish to seek legal advice during proceedings, please do so by passing a note to the legal adviser and, if necessary, we can adjourn. So, we will proceed, then, to group 1, which is the duty to promote public awareness. I move amendment 1 in the Deputy Minister's name and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendment and the other amendments in this group. My amendments 1 and 4 will place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. I tabled these amendments in response to this committee's recommendation\u2014this was a recommendation from this committee in the Stage 1 report, so I have responded to that. I've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from Royal Assent, should the Bill be passed. I've considered amendments 1A to 1E, which have been tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders, and which relate to the duty to raise awareness. We don't think, actually, that this adds anything to the Government amendment, which already mentions awareness. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive, well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change, and understand how to respond to it. But I don't think it's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups, such as visitors to Wales, on the face of the Bill\u2014that's the approach taken in amendment 1E\u2014as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others. In relation to children, the committee will know that I'm fully committed to children\u2019s rights, and that Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions. An additional due regard requirement, such as the one set out in amendment 1D, relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed. This would be part and parcel of the Welsh Government approach to putting children\u2019s rights at the heart of our policy making. Similarly, I don't think it's necessary for the Bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, as is suggested in amendments 1B and 1C. Information required about parenting support will be considered by the parenting expert group, under the auspices of the Bill\u2019s strategic implementation group, working with my officials and the expert stakeholder group on the awareness-raising campaign. And, really, their thinking should not be constrained in any way by specifications on the face of the Bill. I think we always need to bear in mind that what the Bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence; it does not create a new offence. And in this context, it doesn't make sense for this Bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished. As I set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point, safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business, and, as now, the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, and I ask Members to reject amendments 1A to 1E because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the Bill. I wish to speak to amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness. While we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law, the Deputy Minister's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at Stage 1. An important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that I've tabled within this group\u2014that of a sustained awareness campaign, which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the Bill, but serves as a duty for future administrations. Amendment 1A: primarily, amendment 1A changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law. I don't think it's enough for the Welsh Government to say that the public should be made aware of the coming into force of section 1 and that a public awareness campaign needs to be sustained until the Welsh Government's objectives have been achieved. Despite the fact that it is intended to change behaviour, the consequences of this law are far greater than that of organ donation or prohibiting smoking indoors. Instead of an opt-out system or a civil offence, this law will remove a defence for parents, information on which could be there on their records for the rest of their lives, potentially separate parents, and could affect employment chances. As such, whilst we agree with the necessity of the awareness campaign, it is important too that the Welsh Government take stock and ensures that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. The witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands\u2014 lynne neagle am: Janet, Dawn is asking if you'll take an intervention. dawn bowden am: I just wanted to know\u2014could you give us examples of any other piece of legislation where there's been indefinite public awareness campaigns once it's been passed? janet finch-saunders am: There's a lot of legislation. The first Assembly term when I was here\u2014 dawn bowden am: Yes, what I'm asking\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: I'm trying to respond\u2014 dawn bowden am: What I'm asking for is: can you give us specific examples of where there have been indefinite public awareness campaigns running indefinitely past the enactment of a piece of legislation? janet finch-saunders am: The very first term that I was an Assembly Member, we passed 25 pieces of separate legislation. Even today, as I sit here, the public are not aware of many of those pieces of legislation. So, therefore, I think there is a necessity for both children and parents to become involved, and I shall speak now\u2014 dawn bowden am: With respect, Chair, that's not the question I asked. lynne neagle am: I can call you in the debate, if you'd like to make a more substantive contribution on this. janet finch-saunders am: The witnesses who we heard from before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands the implications. And that's what we're talking about here, Members\u2014the implications of removing this defence. Strikingly, the Office of Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent stated the following: 'the potential for public resistance to the Bill through misunderstanding or confusion over it implications may pose the largest barrier to its implementation.' If you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment, it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this Bill. Additionally, the committee found that while the current Welsh Government's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt, future Governments may have less of a commitment. This places further weight on the fact that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the Bill beyond its commencement. Furthermore, the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill quite clearly notes that, under section 2, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister can respond as to the reasons why the Welsh Government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment. [Interruption.] Should our amendment be agreed\u2014 lynne neagle am: Are you taking an intervention? janet finch-saunders am: No. janet finch-saunders am: Should our amendment to be agreed, we also request that a printing change be made to ensure that the new heading reflects promoting awareness of the changes to the law made by section 1. Amendment 1B: amendment 1B is in line with the committee's recommendation 9, which stated that, as part of a public awareness campaign, there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when disciplining their children. During evidence at Stage 1, the witnesses we saw before the committee raised serious concerns about harder-to-reach groups who needed to be made aware of removing the defence. For example, Children in Wales, Action for Children and Play Wales stated that some families and communities may be harder to reach with information and support. Now, while the Deputy Minister states that she would work hard to ensure that harder-to-reach groups receive this information, a duty to provide information on alternatives to physical punishment would ensure that future Welsh Governments would maintain a successful awareness-raising campaign. I note the Deputy Minister accepted the recommendation, through our amendment, but this does not explicitly include a duty to provide details about support for parents. As will be expanded upon later, the Deputy Minister has relied upon the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign to be delivered alongside awareness raising. However, this is only an online resource and she must be clear about what other avenues will be available to parents who do not have access to the internet or are part of harder-to-reach groups. Amendment 1C: amendment 1C supports the committee's recommendation 15 that explains that the Welsh Government should ensure clear advice is provided on what people can do if they have seen or learned of a child being physically assaulted. We urged, at Stage 1, that although many professionals were already under a duty to report concerns about physical punishment, regardless of the Bill, other witnesses raised concerns that it could create the potential for claims of abuse that are unfounded. In particular, some were worried that children, who may not realise the implications of reporting, could make allegations that are actually untrue. While we would expect the awareness-raising campaign to include the consequences of false accusations, this could also be reflected among adults, if the public are not sufficiently made aware of how they can report and in what situations they can report a case of assault. I think it's worth just pointing out at this stage that the majority of the amendments that are being made and articulated by Janet there are based on committee recommendations, and those recommendations were made after taking evidence from the public at large, but also you as well. So, that suggests that, at that stage, we weren't reassured by the offer that you were making because we felt the need to put these recommendations into our report. Now, I recognise that you've moved some way on some of these amendments, and we'll been talking about that through the course of the debates on other groups. But the one thing to bear in mind here is this is legislation, now\u2014that means that this is the instrument of the Assembly, not of Government, and if this Assembly feels that the face of the Bill is unclear on the minimum requirements of a public awareness campaign, then we have the right to suggest the things that we would like to see in that public awareness-raising campaign. The reason these have been tabled individually and independently is that some may be acceptable where others may not be, so it will be disappointing to hear that you're rejecting them all, and the reason they need to go on the face of the Bill is that, if you are going to introduce specifics via regulation, at the moment we have no reassurance about how you're going to do that\u2014about what input the Assembly, on behalf of our constituents, could have in designing that public awareness-raising campaign. Unless you accept some amendments in other groups, that is the position with this Bill: the influence of the Assembly will be zero over the content of an awareness-raising campaign. In terms of it being non-time limited, I think the amendment has been tabled in the way it has not to oblige you to an everlasting, never-ending campaign of awareness raising. But if you bear in mind that, seven years after the introduction of this Bill, there's going to be some reporting on the effectiveness of the Bill, what is the point of doing that if you don't then have an obligation, should the reports require it to be necessary, to continue promoting the changes in the law? I accept that that can't go on for centuries, but to actually limit it to two years on an issue that is so sensitive, and which has a reach beyond our boundaries, I think is genuinely a mistake. I think that's true, but I think Janet Finch-Saunders was right to say that members of the public, ordinary individuals, not professionals, will need assurance that they're doing the right thing. The amendment as listed is not even there to encourage people to do that, although that can be read in that way, but it is to help them be certain that they are doing the right thing. If this is going to be up to the individual, as you've said, and the committee itself wasn't reassured that individuals would know what to do, perhaps I can ask you to consider at Stage 3, if you're going to reject this amendment, how you can reassure members of the public that, if they are going to intervene on the back of this law, they're making things better, not worse. dawn bowden am: My comments, really, relate to ongoing awareness-raising campaigns, which I think all of us would want to see, and would appreciate in any changes in legislation. My point, really, is that we have a plethora of legislation that this Assembly has passed in the last 20 years, and I'm not aware of any legislation where, on the face of the Bill we have ongoing awareness-raising campaigns on an indefinite basis. It seems to me that, for some reason, you seem to be wanting to take a completely different approach to this piece of legislation. From what the Deputy Minister is saying\u2014and perhaps I will get some clarity on this\u2014there will be an amendment to the legislation that will say that we have an awareness campaign. That awareness campaign can be the subject of consultation with interested parties in terms of what needs to be included in it. It could also, I assume, Deputy Minister, be an awareness campaign that can be written into a set of guidance for future use. But the point I'm trying to make is that I don't believe that any piece of legislation requires ongoing and indefinite awareness-raising campaigns, and particularly in relation to visitors to Wales. Again, we have other pieces of legislation in Wales that are not applicable in the other parts of the UK. I am not aware that there is a necessity for awareness-raising campaigns with visitors coming into Wales on the raft of the other pieces of legislation that we have that they don't. And similarly, when we go to visit countries that have different legislation, we don't necessarily know what legislation we're going into when we visit that country\u2014you just go there and you accept that you go to a different country and you abide by their laws. So, my key point, Chair, is just the necessity of an ongoing, endless awareness campaign being written onto the face of the Bill. hefin david am: My comments follow logically from Dawn Bowden's comments, particularly in relation to amendments 1D and 1E. What you would be doing is that this Senedd, if this was on the face of the Bill, the duty on Ministers, would be putting the duty on Ministers in law beyond the life of the fifth Senedd, into the next Senedd term, and putting that duty on those newly elected Ministers after that, which, in principle, would be against the principles of binding\u2014 lynne neagle am: Hefin, are you taking an intervention from Suzy? hefin david am: Yes, happy to. hefin david am: I'm happy to take it now, because I was going to sum up by agreeing with the point you made, actually. You referred to this potentially binding Ministers in future Assemblies; at the moment, we've got an implementation period and a five-year reporting period that takes any reporting on this Act into the Assembly after next. I'm wondering if you're going to have any comments on that when we come to the amendment to change that later on. hefin david am: Well, when we get to that amendment, I'll make comments if I feel it necessary. But at this point in time, we're talking about amendments 1D and 1E, and particularly in relation to 1D and 1E it just isn't necessary, given the fact that\u2014I won't call it a concession, because I think you made a reasonable point about the Minister making a statement at Stage 3, and I think Dawn Bowden actually supported that as well. And that's my key point, really, which is why I wouldn't vote for those two amendments. I don't believe that there is a need for an indefinite campaign, as is outlined in 1A. I agree entirely that there is a need for a campaign during the period of change, and therefore I'm very glad to see that the Government has brought forward amendment 1, and I do hope that there will be a real push during the period of change. In terms of amendment 1B, I do have sympathy with what is being said here, but I believe that any kind of information or campaign in terms of enabling parents to learn about alternatives to physical punishment should be the subject of continual far-reaching work by the Government, through various programmes, and it should not be an addition on the face of this Bill, which deals with a small change to the common law. And then, on 1D also, if I may\u2014I don't agree with this either. Again, I believe that there is a need to promote awareness amongst children, but that should happen through the children's rights convention, as part of a broader programme to promote children's rights. julie morgan am: Thank you all very much for your contributions to the debate and your comments on these amendments today. I just want to re-emphasise that it is as a result of the recommendation from this committee that we are putting this duty to have the awareness campaign on the face of the Bill,\u00a0and I absolutely recognise the crucial role awareness raising has to play in supporting the implementation of the Bill. I'm very grateful for and appreciate the committee's interest and the work that you've done in this area of work. We're committed to a high-intensity awareness over six years from Royal Assent, and there is an expert stakeholder group supporting us with the development of the awareness campaign. Would you just take an intervention on that just to help me understand? A two-year awareness-raising campaign\u2014how have you concluded that\u2014 julie morgan am: Six-year. suzy davies am: Oh, so it is going to continue beyond section 1 coming into force\u2014 julie morgan am: Yes. Amendment 1B, about support available to parents and how to access it\u2014again, this level of detail is not required on the face of the Bill. I just want to emphasise we have got this expert implementation group, who are working on all aspects of this Bill, many of whom represent organisations who gave evidence to this committee. I think lots of these amendments are very helpful and interesting, but would be discussed and would be acted on in the normal pathway of planning and development, and they're not required on the face of the Bill. So, I'm not putting them down, I'm just saying that we don't need them to be there on the face of the Bill. And then amendment 1C\u2014the information about how to raise concerns\u2014I do repeat that safeguarding is everybody's business, and the same issues apply now as will after this defence has been removed. Amendment 1D\u2014Ministers to have regard to the need to promote awareness among children\u2014now, children's rights are absolutely enshrined in our policy making, and the entire Bill is about protecting the rights of children. Again, in terms of visitors, the level of detail is simply not required on the face of the Bill. And then to pick up a few of the other points that were raised, revisions to the impact assessments are being considered as part of my commitment to update the explanatory memorandum ahead of Stage 3. The issue that was raised about the Scottish Bill, that it refers to 'understanding'\u2014now, the Scottish Bill was not a Government Bill, it was a private Member's Bill, and our view is that nothing is added by adding the 'understanding'; 'awareness' is sufficient. So, basically, I think that the points made have been very useful, but I urge committee members to accept my amendments, but to reject those proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders, as they are unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needs to achieve. Does any\u00a0Member object? [Objection.]\u00a0Okay, I'll take a vote by show of hands.\u00a0All those in favour of amendment 1B.\u00a0All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, as there's an objection, I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 1? julie morgan am: I do. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, we have an objection, so we'll take a vote by show of hands. We'll move on now then to group 2, which relates to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation. I move amendment 2 in the Deputy Minister's name, and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments, and the other amendments in this group.",
        " The amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the Bill, and I believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee, so you strongly influenced this amendment. It's clear from Members' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at Stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment. I've already provided assurance that I agree with the importance placed on such a review, both in the explanatory memorandum and during Stage 1 scrutiny. I also made a commitment to bring forward a Government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the Bill. As I said in my responses to the Stage 1 committee report, and as set out in the explanatory memorandum, the post-implementation review of this Bill will not be a single piece of work, but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1. Firstly, we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys, which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment. Secondly, through a dedicated task and finish group, we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the Bill and to consider the possible impact on services. Turning to amendment 2C, this amendment would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced. This amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what I think is a priority for the implementation of this Bill: that is, given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders. I also think this amendment is not required because, as I've already stated, we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising. In June, I shared the findings of a representative survey, which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation. I speak to amendments 2C, excluding 2D, to 2K, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment. Again, I must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment. Amendments 2E to 2K outline what we would expect to be within this report, and we would wish to see a commitment from the Deputy Minister to ensure the National Assembly for Wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report. Amendment 2C requests that the Welsh Government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign and lays it before the Assembly before section 1 commences. As I have outlined under my amendments in group 1, the understanding of the public about the implications of the Bill cannot be sidelined. Although the Deputy Minister has repeated her commitment to a public awareness campaign, we, as the National Assembly for Wales, must be able to scrutinise its effectiveness before section 1 begins. As I noted under amendments 1B to 1E, there are specific groups of people who need to be evaluated on their understanding of the Bill's effect. I'm sure that the Deputy Minister will agree that the harder-to-reach groups are undoubtedly the most vulnerable to any negative impacts that the Bill will have because of the greater potential of a lack of awareness. It is, therefore, important for the Assembly to be able to determine whether the awareness-raising campaign has had a positive effect on these groups of people. As will also be elaborated under amendment 2D, it is extremely important that we, as the Parliament of Wales, are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign's impact. Before we implement what will be a criminal offence, it is vital that we ensure that those affected are not adversely impacted because of a poorly targeted awareness campaign. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister would commit to an independent evaluation of the awareness campaign's effects before section 1 commences. Deputy Minister, first of all, can I just say thank you for your opening remarks about the possibility of perhaps doing some work around amendment 2B? I'll come to that a little bit later, if I may. I just want to begin by commenting briefly on what you said about why you'll be rejecting amendment 2C here. I actually don't think that this amendment should affect or jeopardise the commencement date in any way at all. It's an operational requirement to get this work done before the commencement date that's in the draft Bill at the moment. So, failing to meet that would be as a result of operations not going well, rather than anything intrinsic in the Bill, so I'm not sure I can accept your argument on that. And, on 2D\u2014very pleased to hear that you'd be willing to introduce something about 'laying' rather than 'publishing' at Stage 3, but, in the spirit of recognising that this is the legislature, perhaps I could encourage you just to accept the amendment at this stage, because it doesn't make any difference. Your amendment is going to pass, and this amendment to it would be\u2014I think the gesture there would be very much appreciated. I'll be speaking mainly to amendments 2A and 2B, but I want to begin, again, by thanking you for moving some way on this and considering amendments to the Bill on the issue of reporting, because I know you were keen to avoid amendments in the name of simplicity; you mentioned it earlier. But this is not a newid bychan, I'm afraid, Si\u00e2n; the terms and the effect of this Bill are quite extensive, and it does need the reassurances, if you like, necessary to mitigate potentially disproportionate effects of this Bill on families where parents' actions had been lawful up until this point in statute. I know that you're sincere that you want this duty to report to show that the Bill is effective in stopping smacking as a punishment, and also that it is not as harmful to parents as perhaps some of us fear. But, if this were me bringing forward this Bill, I think I'd want to show the world that I was doing the right thing a lot sooner than you appear to wish to do. Amendment 2 means that the efficacy of the Bill will not formally be assessed until seven years after it has passed. If you're relying on the two-year period before section 1 comes into operation to do much of the heavy lifting on the culture change, and I think that is what you're expecting\u2014you know, showing a reduction in the incidence of physical punishment, reducing the number of, and indeed the likelihood of, parents putting themselves in the path of criminal liability once those two years are up\u2014I really would have thought you'd want people to know sooner, or as soon as the first possible opportunity on that. Waiting five years, I think, will diminish the ability of you to prove the efficacy of those initial two years, and this is why I'm grateful to you for your offer, because there may be a way where we can overcome that. If the trend of culture change is continuing after year 3\u2014so, basically, in the first year after section 1 comes into effect\u2014that's great, but there's a possibility it's going to reverse. For myself, I think one year would probably be enough, but I think three years is a reasonable compromise, as opposed to five years, for a reporting period. I can't see the reason for quite that length of time\u2014I know you've talked about New Zealand\u2014but neither can the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee. When they took the step of recommending this duty to evaluate and report, they also took the step of suggesting a three-year reporting period being more in keeping with other post-legislative scrutiny. That's something I think we perhaps need to bear in mind now, as we enter this period of the consolidation of law. Five/seven years is really something of an outlier, and while that might have been appropriate, perhaps, in New Zealand, I don't think that fits in with our timetables generally here in Wales, and, of course, there are other countries that have introduced this over a period of years, and I note that you haven't drawn on them in order to support your argument. So, can I urge Members and the Minister to consider the arguments behind these amendments? I don't think it's going to reassure anyone\u2014you may want to intervene at this point, Hefin\u2014that we not only won't hear in this Assembly, we won't hear in the next Assembly, about the formal evaluation of this, unless I follow\u2014 hefin david am: I won't intervene; I'll speak. suzy davies am: Is that okay? hefin david am: Yes, I'll make the point. lynne neagle am: Okay, I've got\u2014 suzy davies am: Yes, I'll take the intervention. lynne neagle am: No,\u00a0he doesn't want to make an intervention\u2014 hefin david am: I won't do an intervention; I'll speak. suzy davies am: Oh, apologies\u2014 hefin david am: Just to say\u2014 suzy davies am: I'll wait. The point I was making about 1D and 1E is they close down choices to Ministers in future Assemblies. An evaluative practice would actually open up those choices and give future Parliaments more options with regard to this Bill, so I think it's entirely consistent. I don't think the Minister, in putting in amendment 2, was trying to undermine my argument. Actually, I think she's being constructive by doing that, and I think amendment 2 is a practical amendment that's quite helpful, and its consequence will be to open up choices to future Parliaments, whereas my objection to 1D and 1E is they close those down. suzy davies am: Okay, well, as I say, I think, actually,\u00a0the Deputy Minister's offer of a three-year interim period might be part of a resolution to this. Because I'm not 100 per cent sure I accept your argument, either, because it closes it down for the interim period if we don't move on with the Deputy Minister's suggestion\u2014which I'll talk about now, actually. But I need some clarity on what you would allow this Assembly to do in helping define the terms of that interim report. Because you've been very clear that you don't want to accept the things that Janet Finch-Saunders has been talking about in a final report, and yet I can tell you we want to hear about these things. So, if you're in a position where you can give a commitment at Stage 3 not only to introduce an interim report, but that you will consult with, perhaps, this committee\u2014I'll leave it to you\u2014on the contents of that interim report, what we would want to see tested, then I'll be minded not to move amendment 2B. If you can't give me that reassurance, then I'm going to move it anyway and we'll return to it at Stage 3, if you don't mind. Just a final point on this issue of reporting within three months rather than as soon as practicable, and I do take your point that there may be a misalignment with reporting periods from the organisations you hope to talk to. Again, at Stage 3, I'm happy if you want to make three months six months, or something like that, but 'as soon as practicable' is open ended, and what you think is practicable may be very different from what I or my constituents think is practicable. So, I don't want to stick with what is practicable; I would like you to put a date on this. If it's a case that you think six months is long enough for data gathering and reporting from third parties, I think that's fairly reasonable as well, but I'm not minded to allow you to just keep this open ended. sian gwenllian am: Yes, I welcome adding to the Bill through amendment 2, and what you've said today also, that you're willing to provide an interim report and bring an amendment forward to allow that through the Bill, and to lay a report before the Assembly. I am interested in what Suzy is saying, and have a lot of sympathy with trying to tie it down to specific time periods, and not say 'when it will be practicable'. Therefore, I would encourage you not to move your amendments if you have the confirmation that you want to hear this morning from the Minister regarding these issues. julie morgan am: Well, just to start off on that point, I think your suggestion about how we consult and discuss, I think I'm very happy to accept that. So, I'm happy to discuss that with you, and with the committee, before the third Stage. Well, just to go on to cover some of the points that have been raised, on the issue of training now, I think Janet raised a number of points about training, and we do have an operations, procedures, processes and training task and finish group as part of our implementation work, and they are considering guidance and training requirements. There are many professional bodies represented on that group, many of whom I think have given evidence here today, and they've really got a chance to have their say. The officials are also looking at training as part of the revision of the explanatory memorandum at Stage 3, so there will be more information about training there. Generally, I think that all the contributions are very helpful, and I know they're meant in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation. I can't support amendments 2A, 2C, and amendments 2E to 2K, because these amendments make little difference in terms of practical effect to what we have in the Bill already, or they're covered by the Government amendments that I've moved. But I do hope the committee is reassured that we are committed to undertaking a very thorough, multifaceted review of the impact of the legislation that includes tracking public attitudes and considering impacts on\u00a0public services. Now, tracking the public attitudes will be going along at regular points, so there's no question there of having to wait; we'll be having regular reporting of public attitudes. Of course, I appreciate that you will not be supporting these amendments, but can you give us some indication of how many of the areas of interest to us you will be reporting on? So, even if this is not a statutory commitment, what exactly from our list, our wish list here, would you be prepared to include in your evaluation? julie morgan am: Well, I would actually have thought all of them. Obviously, this is not a statutory thing I'm saying, but\u2014 suzy davies am: No, no, and this is not a\u2014 julie morgan am: Yes, but considering those points you've put forward, I think all of them have got a great deal of relevance. We will certainly be reporting to the group to consider any of the ideas that you've suggested and, in particular with the data collection and the monitoring task and finish group, which is about developing methods to collect data, we will be putting forward some of the suggestions that you've made on those issues. I'm hopeful you may withdraw the two amendments\u2014I think one of yours and it was one of Janet's, wasn't it\u2014so that we could work together on those before the next stage. Because I am sympathetic to your views on these matters, and I think they do reflect some of the discussions in the committee as well. In line with the recommendations of the Finance Committee, further details of the costs associated with the post-implementation review will be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment at Stage 3. So, I think at this point I would ask that Members reject the non-Government amendments and agree to my amendments 2 and 5, which will ultimately achieve the same policy aim without the need for unnecessary detail on the Bill, with the exception, obviously, of those two amendments, which I'm prepared to look at a way of moving forward on. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote by show of hands. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 2A? suzy davies am: I move amendment 2A, yes. lynne neagle am: Janet, do you wish to move amendment 2E? janet finch-saunders am: I move. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so can I see all those in favour of amendment 2F? All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, can I see all those in favour of amendment 2G? All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so can I see all those in favour of amendment 2H? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Can I see all those in favour of 2J? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] I'll therefore take a vote by show of hands. All those in favour of amendment 2K? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 2B? suzy davies am: In view of the Deputy Minister's reassurances, I won't move this amendment today, but obviously I reserve the right to bring something back if we can't reach consensus. lynne neagle am: Does any other Member wish to move amendment 2B? Okay, no. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 2? julie morgan am: I do. I move amendment 3 in the Deputy Minister's name and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments and the other amendments in this group. Members will note that I've brought forward an amendment to provide certainty on the date of commencement of the core provision in the Bill, which is obviously to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment. So, we're obviously debating that after we deal with these particular technical issues\u2014these are technical issues here, basically. As a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a Welsh Minister to make an Order for commencement, the power to make transitory, transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the Bill coming into force would also be removed. So, I'm not seeking here to add any new powers to the Bill; amendment 3 will simply add this existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent. In fact, removing the power for the Welsh Ministers to commence the provision in section 1 by Order means the statutory instrument will actually do less than originally intended. These amendments are technical in nature and while I acknowledge that the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied, their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied. The absence of an Assembly procedure does not mean that Ministers' decisions in relation to transitional powers cannot be scrutinised by the Assembly. This was a point made to CLAC and, as I say, their final conclusion was that no procedure is the appropriate procedure for such a power. Well perhaps, Deputy Minister, I can begin by saying that one person's technical issue is another person's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny. But I thank you for noting the Assembly's observations on the ministerial powers granted in this Bill\u2014this time by CLAC, as you say. Moving this\u2014and I'm glad actually that amendment 8, I think it was, has removed an Order provision and we're moving into an area where at least statutory instruments do feature here. I have to say that amendment 3A is something of a probing amendment, and I'll explain why now. Your amendment 3 seeks to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1, but it's actually in a substantive part of section 1 itself now\u2014it's not a separate commencement power. And, actually, I've been listening to the rest of this debate, and thinking that, if you're going to be introducing an awareness campaign and a report, the chances are you're going to need some regulatory powers to introduce some of the aspects of both those policy areas, I think. And I'm wondering whether the\u2014what is it\u2014transitory, transitional and saving provisions are actually enough powers for you under the course of this Bill. I'm wondering whether you want to consider actually amending this to give yourself the more usual unrestricted power to make regulations in order for you to get section 1 implemented, bearing in mind that it has now been amended from that original, very short and simple\u2014or at least simple in terms of drafting\u2014initial draft. As I say, in anticipation of you rejecting amendments in group 1 I tabled this, in order to make sure that an opportunity remains for the Assembly to bring anything you may wish to introduce under section 1, when it comes into effect, onto the floor of the Assembly. Because while I completely accept that you've acknowledged that statutory instrument is the process for introducing things from now on, it's still possible to do that without procedure, and so I have no idea whether you think what you introduce would be better suited to be introduced by a negative or affirmative procedure. Amendment 3A is a holding position, which we will return to you in Stage 3, because I think, again, this is an area where it might be valuable for us to discuss quite what kind of powers you're looking for, because I think you probably need something that's beyond transitional, transitory and saving. lynne neagle am: Are there any other Members who wish to speak on this group? No. We don't actually think it's necessary to have wider powers, but we will keep this under review and at Stage 3, I think that\u2014. When I was looking at this, I was concerned to know what the transitory powers\u2014what we would actually need to do at that stage, but I can understand that there may be links to other Bills in ways that we are not anticipating at the moment that would make it necessary to have those powers. So, basically, I don't think it is necessary to have wider powers, but I can assure you that we'll keep that in review coming up to Stage 3. suzy davies am: Can I just ask a question on the back of that? lynne neagle am: Will you take a brief intervention at the end, Minister? suzy davies am: Will you take the briefest intervention before your full stop? julie morgan am: I was going to end there, yes. suzy davies am: Right, okay, well, just before your full stop, would you just confirm that you're happy for us to discuss this before Stage 3? julie morgan am: Yes, very happy. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 3A? suzy davies am: I'll move it, yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, I'll take a vote by show of hands. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 3? julie morgan am: I do. The committee will now break for 10 minutes and reconvene at 11.05 a.m. Can I welcome Members back? We will move on to group 4, which relates to the duty to ensure sufficient funding. As I outlined under amendments 2I and 2J, there are ongoing concerns about the potential costs for Welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment. Now, it was absolutely clear from evidence that we received in this committee that unknown costs would be challenging and potentially problematic. As I have mentioned previously, these concerns would doubtless be most keenly felt in our hard-pressed social services. Furthermore, the Welsh Local Government Association stated that there must be a commitment that whatever the costs are, those costs are met, because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales.",
        " Now, during evidence, the Deputy Minister, when asked about the reliance on a limited number of reporting of cases likely to happen and the potential for a degree of unknown costs stated: 'we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate.' But you couldn't commit to a broad figure, instead telling us that: 'we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us.' And: 'We have to measure it as we go along.' Given that devolved authorities need to plan their budgets for these changes, we only think it is fair for the Welsh Government to provide sufficient funding to alleviate the cost implications of this Bill. Now, while amendment 11 makes reference to costs borne by local authorities and health boards, I note that amendment 12 takes this further by including other devolved authorities that are not funded by Welsh Government. Anticipating the Deputy Minister's response that few under this category, if any at all, would be affected by the Bill, we are pursuing a principle here, and it is agreement to the principle of providing sufficient funding that we are seeking from you as the Deputy Minister. The Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013: last year, the Economy, Infrastructure and Skills Committee found that the Wales annual spend on walking and cycling is half that of England's and one sixth of Holland's. Furthermore, the committee highlighted that the passing of the Act put a requirement on local authorities to continuously improve active travel routes, but were constrained by the funding made available to them. Now, my local authority and other authorities that have done some monitoring on the active travel Act\u2014they simply were not awarded sufficient funding to actually allow the active travel Act to become a meaningful piece of legislation, and the same goes with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. This month, the auditor general has raised concerns that the public services boards created under the Act were limited in their work and impact due to the lack of dedicated funding. Outside of the Welsh Government's regional grant that cannot be spent on projects, councils often contribute through officer time or facilities, but resources and capacity to support those PSBs remain a key risk, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more. The reason that I wanted these amendments placed in here is I genuinely do not believe that you've even envisioned what, or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organisations, and certainly our local authorities and health boards, the impact this Bill is going to have. I can understand that the Member is concerned about the impact of this Bill on public services, but you will see from the explanatory memorandum and from the raft of impact statements published with the Bill that we've done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of this Bill before introduction. And as far as we're aware, no other country has done more than us to consider the impacts of similar legislation, and also comprehensively prepared for implementation. We've explored the published data, which is available from other countries, on the impact of measures they've taken to prohibit the physical punishment of children. We've also spoken to a range of stakeholders in Ireland, New Zealand and Malta, who have legal systems similar to our own. And stakeholders have been clear when giving evidence to this committee that they do not consider there will be runaway costs, and I think we should trust their judgment on this. In fact, as this committee notes in its Stage 1 report, those delivering services on the front line have said, without exception, that 'this Bill will improve their ability to protect children living in Wales because it will make the law clear.' Sally Jenkins of the Association of Directors of Social Services said to this committee: 'In terms of thresholds for children\u2019s services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. Jane Randall, chair of the National Independent Safeguarding Board Wales, said: 'there's no expectation that there's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals coming through to local authority social services, I think it would be dealt with within their existing resources.' And Dr Rowena Christmas, Royal College of General Practitioners, said: 'I can't see it's going to lengthen consultations. I can't see that it's going to increase the number of consultations, and I don't think it's going to increase the number of referrals I make to the health visitor or to social services, because if I was worried, I'd make those referrals now regardless of the Bill.' I just want to say again that the Bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault, which has formed part of the common law of England and Wales for a very long time. And social services already receive and investigate reports of children being assaulted, including from health and education, so it's not a whole new area of costly activity for any of them. As I've already pointed out when discussing group 2 amendments, we're working with organisations to put in place arrangements to collect data about the possible impact on their services, and this will be analysed as part of the post-implementation review of the legislation. Welsh Government can consider with relevant organisations how best to manage any impact on workloads or resources and any cost implications. I can assure you that work to update the regulatory impact assessment has continued, and I've asked officials to prepare a revised RIA, as recommended at Stage 2, and I expect to share an updated RIA with you in advance of Stage 3. Serious consideration is being given on how to provide more detailed estimates of the unknown costs to public services arising from the Bill, but I think you should be reassured by the evidence that was given, particularly to this committee, from the professionals at the front line. What the amendments are proposing is outside the normal funding arrangements that operate within Government, and it's not clear why, in the context of the evidence heard at Stage I, such provisions are necessary. I'm sure that Members will agree that future Governments need to be able to consider, within the context of the budget-setting process, what the priorities are, and these considerations would need to be made within the context at that time, for example taking into account any issues that there are\u2014UK Government actions, what happens in relation to Brexit, or any other unforeseen impacts on the economy or Welsh society. Furthermore, as is the case now, the National Assembly for Wales scrutinises the Welsh Government budget annually, so it would be able to make an argument for additional funding for public bodies, should it consider that this is required. I do think all the evidence has shown that we do not anticipate that there will be a huge increase of a demand for funding, so I urge Members to reject these amendments, which I believe are unnecessary. janet finch-saunders am: Chair, could I ask a question? lynne neagle am: You can reply to the debate now, Janet, yes. When we were taking evidence, at an earlier stage, I noticed that part of the stakeholder group\u2014there was some liaison going on with social services departments across Wales. What discussions have taken place with our local authorities in terms of their social services departments in terms of the lead, the cabinet members, or, indeed, the head of service? I can speak from my own experiences, when going around my constituency, but when I've spoken to some of the family support groups, and, indeed, the departments themselves, they are very concerned about the financial impact that this is going to have on the provision. They're already overstretched, and they see this as another burden\u2014primarily another financial burden. So, how much have you engaged with them? julie morgan am: There's been extensive engagement. We've had meetings with the Association of Directors of Social Services, and they're represented on all our groups, and we're working very closely with them, because, of course, they represent all the local authorities. But I have to say, when I've been going round and meeting lots of different groups, the first thing they say is, 'I'm so glad that you're doing this', and they haven't mentioned any financial implications. But, obviously, we will be very aware of\u2014we are looking at any more evidence that comes up. I was hoping to see some commitment to\u2014this Bill was going to go through, and it's one that could be implemented fully, because sufficient resources were there. Janet, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 12? janet finch-saunders am: I move. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 4? julie morgan am: Yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you want to proceed to a vote on amendment 5? julie morgan am: Yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you want to move to a vote on amendment 6? julie morgan am: Yes. lynne neagle am: I move amendment 6, then, in the name of the Deputy Minister. And I call Suzy Davies to move amendment 9 and to speak to the amendment and the other amendments in the group. Amendment 9 is actually consequential on amendment 10 passing, but it's the lead amendment in the group, so I'll move it to begin the debate. You've said repeatedly, and I believe you, that you do not wish to criminalise parents but just to stop them physically punishing their children. You could have chosen to try and achieve this through awareness raising and civil enforcement, but by choosing to remove the defence to a criminal act you have entered the arena of criminal law, where the logical consequence is opening parents up to liability\u2014not necessarily getting prosecuted, but liability to prosecution, not just liability to civil sanctions. I'm sure you'd prefer parents not to be prosecuted, but that decision does not and cannot lie with you. You, like us, have no agency in this, because the powers and the duties of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service sit outside our competence. You cannot and we cannot, by law or otherwise, instruct either of them in the delivery of your policy intention of not criminalising parents. You've acknowledged to this committee and the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee that revised CPS charging guidance and any other guidance on, for example, out-of-court disposals, are key to delivering your policy objectives. You'll remember how concerned this committee was when we learned that your advisory group\u2014the strategic implementation group, is it\u2014was only in the early stages of discussing what these guidelines might look like. So, you're actually asking us to pass law when we have no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children\u2014no control of the regard given to the relevance of force, the frequency of the offence, any prior conviction, any prior reporting, not even the views of the child in how they might be sentenced, or thresholds that would be appropriate for cautions and other out-of-court disposals; no guidance to the police on thresholds for arrest, let alone charging. And you argue that the rights of the child are what matter, and I agree with you here, but everybody, adult or child, has a right to natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, and you are in no position to offer us any comfort on these matters at this stage. I anticipate that that's unlikely, and I hope I'm wrong, but that's why Janet and I have tabled amendments 10 and 15, which prevent you bringing section 1 into force until that CPS guidance has been fully updated to take into account the change in the law and until pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed. That reflects our recommendation 4, this committee's recommendation, as well as CLAC's recommendation 1. It gives your strategic implementation board time to consider how it can get around the other fundamentally worrying issue of the effect of recording reports of apparent physical punishment, even if those reports ultimately prove unfounded. I have to say, Minister, I think these points are so serious that I would have liked to have tabled amendments preventing you seeking Royal Assent for this Bill until the Assembly has seen drafts of the range of official guidance needed for the police and CPS. I'd have sought a Report Stage, if I could, so that we could consider that evidence. But I'm therefore asking you to support the amendments we have tabled, 10 and 15, so that we can bring some damage limitation to a process that you ultimately cannot control once this Bill has passed. Now, I know you've got the numbers to pass this Bill, whether you accept amendments or not, but I just hope you can see the danger in pushing forward with a Bill that changes a person's relationship with the criminal law when you have no legal control over the consequences of that, and you're inviting this Assembly to fall into the same trap. Janet, do you want to speak? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I wish to speak to amendments 14 and 16. As was clear during the committee's evidence sessions, present Welsh Government support programmes for parents have insufficient coverage. For example, the capacity and reach of the Healthy Child Wales programme came under question on its role in awareness raising, with health representatives acknowledging that universality had not been achieved, with 53.2 per cent of children in Wales reported as being contacted. Furthermore, existing parenting support is often only available as part of a targeted programme in specific areas, such as Flying Start, and even the children's commissioner noted that much more is needed to support parents to find alternatives to disciplining their children. Now, the Deputy Minister mentioned the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign as part of proposals on a wider package of support for children and their parents. However, the Deputy Minister was challenged on this fact, that this is an online campaign only, and could only respond that the mapping exercise she will undertake. Therefore, the Deputy Minister needs to assure the committee and the public that universal support will be provided before the removal of the defence occurs. I've listened to what stakeholders and committees have said about the importance of ensuring sufficient time is available prior to the change in the law to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment during Stage 1. As a result, I have brought forward amendments in this group to provide certainty around the date for the change in the law. My amendment 7 will remove the power to commence this core provision of the Bill by Order of the Welsh Ministers and ensure that the defence of reasonable punishment is abolished at the end of a two-year period beginning the day after Royal Assent. Up to then, we'd always said 'up to two years'\u2014well, we're giving two years. This certainty will allow key partners, including the police, social services and the Crown Prosecution Service, to plan for changes to guidance, training and data-collection systems more effectively. My amendment 8 in this group has the consequence of removing the power to make transitional provision, which is replaced by my amendments 3 and 6, and we discussed those in the previous group. I've listened to the arguments put forward by Suzy Davies and Janet Finch-Saunders for the amendments in this group that they have tabled. These amendments are all about making the commencement of the Bill conditional on something else happening, whether it's waiting for the revision of Crown Prosecution Service guidance, or the establishment of a pathway for diversion from the criminal justice system, or for the provision of parenting support services. As I set out in my letter of response to the Stage 1 report from the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee, we've got good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group, and we work very closely with them. But the CPS are an independent body, as Suzy Davies has said in her contribution, not answerable to Welsh Ministers or this legislature, and it's not appropriate for a Minister or the National Assembly to seek to influence the CPS guidelines. And, in fact, I think that these amendments\u2014Suzy's amendments in particular\u2014wouldn't just seek to influence the CPS, but would actually give power to a non-devolved body on the way that we legislate in Wales. I think you have to rely on the fact that we have got this very good relationship, very close working relationship. And I think legislating to effectively give a non-devolved body a power to commence, or not, Assembly legislation would be highly unusual and would raise great uncertainty, I think, if we did go down that track, because I think this is very important Welsh legislation, which does have broad support across the Assembly. And I don't think we should allow non-devolved bodies to be the final arbiters of commencement of our legislation. I think the CPS is entirely independent of Government, and must be entirely independent of Government, and will make its own decisions about how and when it will revise its guidance. In addition, you suggest we allow the UK Government to have a say in when Welsh legislation is commenced in an area that was specifically devolved to the Assembly. If these amendments passed, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to judge when section 1 could be commenced. This contravenes what stakeholders and committees have asked for, and raises huge uncertainty, which potentially jeopardises the Bill. And I want to assure you again, not only do we have good working relations with the CPS, but also very good working relationships with the police, who are, of course, the other non-devolved body who have great involvement and interest in these issues. My amendment to provide a two-year period between Royal Assent and commencement means these groups can plan their work to a known timescale and deliver in good time before the law comes into force. And then, when it comes to parenting support, the committee knows that I've committed to reviewing the existing provision of parenting support, and work is already under way through the parenting expert group on this very issue. I have already said I will expand the age range of the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign, and I think\u2014. For example, the universal service of the health visitors is absolutely crucial, and that is a service that is for every child. And the expert group is considering what it'll recommend for the future, and it needs the time to be able to do that, to support the Bill as well as to support parenting more widely. So, as I said, I think these are important points that you have raised, but I don't think they are appropriate. So, I therefore urge the committee not to support amendments 9 and 10, nor 13, 14 and 15. suzy davies am: Thank you very much, and thank you very much, Deputy Minister, as well. I'm disappointed that you haven't seen what's behind Janet Finch-Saunders's final amendment there, actually. Maybe it's something we'll raise again with you at Stage 3, or maybe in the conversations that we have between now and then. But I want to go back to amendments 10 and 15 that I've raised and your assertion that we're giving, or attempting to give, power to the CPS here. And this is why I go back to where my contribution to this started, and it's your choice to try and resolve the problem of\u2014or, sorry, to try and protect children's rights through the medium of a change to the criminal law rather than the many opportunities that were available to you through the civil law and over which you would have had complete competence. This Bill\u2014and, actually, you've said a couple of times in your response today that it's important that it's commenced on a certain date. My argument is: it shouldn't be commenced at all unless you are absolutely certain about how it is likely to affect the parents who will now be captured by the removal of the defence. And, while I claim no mischief on the part of the CPS or the police\u2014obviously I don't\u2014there is nothing you can do that would prevent the CPS, should they wish to do it, or indeed the police with their own guidelines, putting in place something that is wholly disproportionate to the offence that is now being released by the removal of a defence. And, because of that, I ask you to consider, or balance, actually, two important things here: one is the rights of the child, obviously at the forefront of your argument on this, which I would argue could be completely and safely protected through the use of civil law on this occasion; and, actually, the rights of the child again to have a good relationship with parents over whose future they will have no say\u2014or at least you cannot allow them to have any say in how those parents might be treated in terms of sentencing. The relationship between parents and children obviously is different in every family, but that's something you ought to protect in what you're trying to do here, and by leaving it open, as you say, to completely different\u2014sorry, undevolved, two undevolved authorities to make decisions about how that relationship could be affected deeply worries me. I know this isn't going to stop your Bill going forward, but I really want you to consider my arguments and how you might try and address them at Stage 3, because leaving, effectively, the delivery of your policy objectives to somebody over whom you have no control, despite your great relationship with them, should worry us all as a legislature. Do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 9? suzy davies am: Oh, because of the voting order\u2014. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to move to a vote on amendment 7? julie morgan am: I do. lynne neagle am: I move amendment 7 in the name of the Deputy Minister.\u00a0The question is that amendment 7 be agreed. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 8? julie morgan am: I do. Well, that has brought us to the end of our amendments, so can I thank the Deputy Minister and her officials for their attendance? As usual, you will be sent a transcript of the meeting to check for factual accuracy. Standing Orders make provision for the Deputy Minister to prepare a revised explanatory memorandum, taking account of the amendments agreed today. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, following our meeting on 2 October. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services updating the committee on the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' strategy. And paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services regarding early childhood education and care, following the session that we held on 2 October. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting"

    [
        "Item 2 this morning is our evidence session with the Cabinet Secretary for Education for our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Kevin Palmer, who is deputy director, pedagogy, leadership and professional learning; and Andrew Clark, deputy director, further education and apprenticeships division. So, thank you all for attending, and we're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. Could you give us your views on how the Welsh bac is valued by learners and teachers? kirsty williams am: Bore da, Julie, and thank you very much for your question. Firstly, I'd like to begin by saying that I as the Cabinet Secretary value the qualification very much indeed. I believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in Wales a broad and balanced curriculum, recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work, and I believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that. I meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the Welsh bac, and much of that was evidenced in\u00a0Qualifications Wales's review into the Welsh baccalaureate. They did focus group work with a representative sample, and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it.\u00a0I meet regularly with individuals who have been able to use their bac to successfully gain a place at university, so I believe there's a huge value for Welsh young people being able to study this particular qualification alongside the more traditional qualifications that perhaps we're all used to. I think the challenge is that, given that many people are very familiar with what a GCSE is and, as parents, we will know what that is and many of us will have done\u2014some of us are so old we'll have done O-levels. We know what those traditional qualifications look like, and therefore a new qualification\u2014there's always a job of work to do to communicate that, if people aren't used to it, but I value it hugely. I think that, whilst there is always room for improvement\u2014and, of course, you'll be aware of the review that Qualifications Wales undertook and that has suggested ways in which we can further improve and refine the qualification, but I think it is a valuable piece of work for Welsh young people to undertake. julie morgan am: It's great that you've been around listening to learners and what they have said about it. Have you had any negative feedback? kirsty williams am: Well, occasionally, of course, we do have concerns raised with us, and those concerns are similar to the ones that have been raised in the Qualifications Wales review. So, for instance, we sometimes have concerns about how some students balance the Welsh bac with other qualifications they may be taking. For some students, there may be concerns about the nature of the Welsh bac and whether that can impact negatively on their well-being. And, obviously, that's why Qualifications Wales have undertaken this piece of work so that we can refine, if necessary, that qualification and how we continue to look at how we ensure my belief that taking the Welsh bac should be the norm for students but also recognising that, in some cases, there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised. julie morgan am: And so would you say that it's valued by learners more or less at key stage 4 or post 16? kirsty williams am: Well, I think that, as I said, the vast majority of students I meet report very positively about the opportunities that are afforded for studying at that level. Occasionally, we hear from students who I believe think that in studying the subject they may be compromising their chances because they want to do additional A-levels, and I'm sure we'll come on to, later on, whether universities, and whether the Russell Group universities in particular, value the qualification. And I think what's really important, and, in talking to universities, since the qualification became graded, rather than just a pass/fail qualification\u2014I think that added rigour since 2015 has been particularly important in ensuring that there's real value in students undertaking that work. julie morgan am: And what about the effect that the leadership in the school has on the way that the bac\u00a0is received? Have you\u2014? kirsty williams am: As always, Julie, leadership is crucial, and students' experiences can be very coloured by the attitude towards the teacher delivering that particular course. And, therefore, we need to continue, alongside the WJEC\u00a0and Qualifications\u00a0Wales, to ensure that the Welsh bac\u00a0is communicated to children in a positive way, the benefits are explained to children and their parents, and, also, we need to ensure that those who are tasked with teaching Welsh bac in their schools or colleges feel confident in their ability to do so and to ensure that students have a really positive experience of that qualification, because if you're being taught by someone who is telling you,\u00a0'Oh, I don't know why we're having to do this', then, obviously that's going to colour how you feel about it. And, if I'm honest, I recently attended a youth forum, where young people from the county were discussing all sorts of issues\u2014everything from the environment to their experience in school\u2014and I was struck by the group of year 12 and year 13 students. I specifically asked them about the bac\u2014I always take the opportunity to ask them about their experience of the baccalaureate. I'm learning a lot.' Students from a school seven miles away\u2014just seven miles away\u2014said, 'Oh, I don't know why we're having to do this.' And I suspect that that has got more to do with how that is being delivered in their institutions than it has about the quality of the qualification. So, we need to keep ensuring that those who are tasked with this see it as\u00a0important, communicate that to students, and have the confidence and the ability to deliver a really positive experience. So, what do you intend to do to try to ensure that there's consistent support and enthusiasm for the bac\u00a0from the leaders? kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, we have the design group of Qualifications Wales looking to address some of the issues that arose out of the report around ensuring that, especially from a teacher workload perspective, it's not too onerous in terms of assessment. So, there's that to do to make sure that we're not asking children to duplicate and do things over and over and over again, which, of course, for any of us, would be wearing and we would question to the value of. The WJEC has resources and support available, but we will look, as we roll out our national approach to professional learning, at that the professional learning needs of those already in the system are addressed. Of course, our accreditation for our new initial teacher education is predominantly addressed at being able to deliver the new curriculum, but, if you think about the elements of 'Successful Futures' and the skills and the knowledge and the pedagogy associated with that, it's very much in line with the Welsh baccalaureate challenge certificate. So, actually, there are opportunities via initial teacher education as well, and we continue to need to look to work with our partners to be able to reinforce why this is a worthwhile qualification. I'd like to see past students of the Welsh baccalaureate being able to talk about their own experiences and why it's made a difference to them. I come across individuals for whom their place at university has been secured by that Welsh baccalaureate, and, all of a sudden, if that's what's got you your place, it becomes a lot more valuable than perhaps it was six months before. We need to make sure that students are aware, and teachers and school leaders are aware,\u00a0of the importance that this qualification\u00a0has. I just want to go back to Julie's question about whether there was a different perspective or a different sense of value for students who are post 16 and those who are pre 16. When one of the college leaders here was asked whether he had people coming to him in his FE college who've been through the pre-16 bac and had heard evidence or had stories of, basically, those children cobbling together their bac in the last four weeks of term before they got there, he said that yes, that is his experience. Does that worry you at all, because, of course, the whole purpose of bac is to teach skills over a period of time, and its purpose cannot be fulfilled by getting it all done in the last term of\u2014which year am I in?\u2014year 11, in order to satisfy the curriculum? kirsty williams am: Yes. Obviously, that's not the experience that we would want young people to have, and, as someone who has had a daughter just finish\u00a0year 11, that's certainly not the experience that my daughter had in her particular school, and I have another daughter who has just gone into year 10, where the Welsh bac\u00a0has started in year 10 and it is a a two-year course in which elements are undertaken. Obviously, we will need to address, as part of the design group and the work that Qualifications Wales is doing, how that is playing out in individual schools. But that would not be a positive experience; we want this to be taken in exactly the same way as we would expect a GCSE to be taught over a period of two years. But, Andrew, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to add from the college perspective. I think that it will depend on the feeder schools to the colleges and it'll depend upon the delivery models that are in existence in those schools. There have been differences in the way that the subject has been\u2014sorry, not the subject, the qualification has been delivered. And I think it'll be helped by a recent review by Qualifications Wales, because they're doing a survey at the moment as to different delivery models in different locations, and that, perhaps, will inform more even practice as we move forwards. andrew clark: No, but it's a known issue, if you like, that various people are attempting to address and bring a more uniform mode of delivery across the nation. lynne neagle am: We've got some more detailed questions now on understanding, from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. sian gwenllian am: Just to drill down rather deeper into the issue of the variability in the way in which the Welsh\u00a0bac is provided, could you explain why you think that this inconsistency is happening, and then what the impact of the inconsistency and variability is on the value that learners attach to the bac\u00a0and their understanding of it? kirsty williams am: I think the variability can be perhaps explained by the fact that it's a new type of qualification, the fact that different schools have adopted it at different rates\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Ten years? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said, over that time, there were some early adopters who have done it in a certain way, there are some people who've come later to it, who may be doing it in a different way. And, as I said, it's quite a different departure from traditional O-levels, from GCSE-type subjects, where there is a programme of work and a syllabus. So, it is a different nature of qualification, and, therefore, as Andrew has just alluded to, schools have approached it in a different way.\u00a0We are alert to that and Qualifications Wales, crucially, is alert to that, and we are looking to ensure greater consistency in how it is delivered in individual schools. We're also aware, in the school setting, in pre 16, there are some concerns about the onerousness of the workload associated with the evaluation of the students' work. We wrote the qualification to be a rigorous qualification for the students, but we don't want it to be jeopardised by the evaluation of it being too onerous. Again, that's one of the issues that the design group and Qualifications Wales are looking at.\u00a0That process is a really important process, so there is the design group, but working alongside the design group, who they are testing the messages and testing their thoughts with, is a stakeholder group, and\u00a0there is also a practitioners group. So, that work by the design group is being tested with those people who have an interest: business, for instance, the world of work\u2014is this qualification really giving students the skills that are valued by potential employers?\u2014but it's also testing its thinking with the practitioners, those people who will be charged with the delivery of the qualification, and I think that's really important to be able to get an understanding of the challenges of making sure there's a consistency, and what are the barriers to that, and what steps need to be taken to ensure a greater level of consistency in delivery. sian gwenllian am: Is there a correlation between consistency in general? Because we know that there's polarisation in the secondary school sector between the good schools and the not-so-good schools. And is there a correlation between\u2014if the schools are good according to Estyn, or excellent, are they also good, excellent at delivering the bac? Is it a fundamental inconsistency across the sector that's causing this inconsistency? kirsty williams am: I don't know. I don't have that data to hand, but, of course, from next year, the bac will be a dedicated performance measure for schools. So, actually, we will be looking specifically at completion of the bac as part of the wider set of school performance measures. So perhaps we will be in a better position once that's formally established to be able to track progress. sian gwenllian am: Because some of the evidence we've heard is that if the leadership is good around the bac in the school, well, everything else follows from that. As I said, I don't have the figures to hand, but, as I said, from next year, the bac actually becomes a formal part of the performance measures for schools. I'll turn, therefore, to the understanding of employers of the Welsh bac and the skills challenge certificate. From the evidence that we've had, it appears that there is a problem in this area, that is, employers generally don't value the qualification. Is that your experience, and how can we improve that? How can we elicit more engagement from employers of all sizes with the value of the baccalaureate? kirsty williams am: Well, the first thing to say is my understanding of the development of the bac is that employers' voices were reflected and they were part of the process that drew up the qualification in the first place. You'll be aware of the review by Qualifications Wales that found that many employers say that the skills that are developed through the baccalaureate are exactly the kinds of skills that they want young people to be acquiring whilst at school, that put them in a good place for looking for employment later. I would agree with you, Si\u00e2n, and not just in terms of the bac, there are lots of reasons why we need greater working between education and employers. I sit down with employer organisations to try and explore better ways in which we can work together\u2014everything from ensuring that children have work experience opportunities through to, for instance, what more some of our companies could do to take up governors' roles, for instance, in our local schools, so that employer voice and that business voice are heard at a school management level. I think of Sony in Bridgend doing a really, really, really good job working with their local schools. In other areas, where you haven't got such a big employer, it can be difficult, can't it, for a small business that is trying to do their small business to think about, 'Oh my goodness, I've got to do something to help improve the education system as well.'\u00a0So, I'm always looking at new ways in which we can get that working together. As I said, the Qualifications Wales design group has a stakeholder group that is helping them with their review into the qualification at the moment, but there are really good examples where employers and other organisations are working together. We also need to continue, I think, to communicate more clearly with employers the nature of the qualification. Again, because it's relatively new, and the brands of the GCSE and A-level are so strong, people know what they are, unless you've either done the Welsh bac yourself or you have a son or a daughter, or a grandson or granddaughter who has gone through the process, you're probably going to be less familiar, and we need to continue to work together with the WJEC and Qualifications Wales as a Government to better communicate the value of the qualification. sian gwenllian am: So, you agree that there is a specific piece of work that needs to be done around employers and that the Government should be leading that. kirsty williams am: Yes, and we are working closely with, as I said, Qualifications Wales to develop a joint communication plan, and we continue, as I said, as part of Qualifications Wales's review into the nature of the qualification\u2014employers' voices are being heard as part of that particular piece of work. But more generally, yes, I think there's more that we can do to better engage employers with the education system in lots and lots of different ways. lynne neagle am: Just before we move off this section, the variability that the committee has seen has been quite pronounced, really. We've been to a school where they've got a passionate and dedicated Welsh bac\u00a0school leader, but then we've spoken to other schools where it's tagged on to a variety of teachers' roles, and that clearly has an impact on the way it's being taught. You said in your answer to Si\u00e2n that you're trying to ensure more consistency in the delivery of it, and you referred to the performance measures; are the performance measures the main vehicle by which you're going to ensure consistency, or are you planning to issue any more guidance to schools on how it should be delivered on the ground? kirsty williams am: We will need to reflect the work that Qualifications Wales is undertaking. So it's not just one thing that we can do that will change this, it is a number of things\u2014everything from the communications plan to making sure that teachers who find themselves responsible for delivering this feel confident and have had the professional learning opportunities to give them the skills so that they do a great job in delivering a positive experience to students. The performance measures, of course, as we know\u2014sometimes in schools, it is those that make schools focus on something. So there's a wide variety of ways in which I think we can look to ensure more consistency. But, in the end, I think it is professional learning and teacher training, ITE, that will make the biggest difference. And just on understanding, one of the things the young people in Crickhowell told us was that they thought the name should be changed. They felt that it wasn't reflective of exactly what the qualification is and that maybe having something that was clearer would be better. Is that something you've considered? kirsty williams am: Well, first of all, I need to declare an interest, because that's the school my daughter goes to, and I don't know if she was the one\u2014 lynne neagle am: She wasn't. My gut instinct tells me that one of the issues that we have is developing an understanding of the brand and what that qualification is, and if we move away from 'Welsh\u00a0bac' and suddenly start to call it something else, I think that could be even harder and set us back from where we are. So, that's not to dismiss it, and I would want to reflect on those views, but I think if one of the issues that we've got is developing a better understanding of the qualification; if we were to suddenly change the name of it, that might have the unintended consequence of making that job even harder. But, obviously, if the committee was to make a recommendation, we would\u2014I'm happy to reflect on that evidence, but, as I said, my gut instinct would tell me that there could be an unintended consequence of moving away from that brand. We've heard people say that the Welsh bac\u00a0has no rigour, that pupils are spoon-fed. We've heard that the Welsh bac\u00a0is passively marked, the grades are inflated, that there's little rigour\u00a0in the sampling and moderation, there's a confusion about how the SCC is graded, and I know that's something you talked about, actually, that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour. I suppose my question to you is: if the Welsh bac\u00a0is being seen in this way by stakeholders, how are going to address that? To what extent is that a real problem? kirsty williams am: I think making it a graded qualification has been really important,\u00a0and I make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous\u2014no apologies for that at all. That's how it should be, and that's how you create value, by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous. What's really important is that it's not just me saying that it's rigorous; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications. The fact is that at advanced level\u2014because I don't know if you're making these observations about the pre-16 Welsh bac, or whether we're talking about the advanced level qualification\u2014that is the equivalent of an A-level. It is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an A-level is. In terms of spoon-feeding, one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it's very difficult, for instance, in the individual project work to be spoon-fed. That's one of the reasons why it's valuable, isn't it, because it teaches a different set of skills? Because if you're doing a traditional, say, history A-level or a science A-level, there's a very strict syllabus and a course, there's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus; with the Welsh bac, it is individual students that have to think, for instance, of their own individual project. You can't get those off a shelf, and you can't necessarily just find that information easily. I do have concerns about some of the feedback by Qualifications Wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload, which is one of the things that Qualifications Wales is looking at. But in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed, then I don't share those concerns. dawn bowden am: Okay, because those were concerns, in the main, that were articulated by people delivering the Welsh bac\u2014by teachers. So, I suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency, because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are.",
        " There is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills\u2014. It would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way. dawn bowden am: And I think what I was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions, because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour, so it was the mixed message, I guess, I was just trying to test out with you. Similarly, on the skills challenge certificate, again we've heard from various stakeholders about whether, in fact, this is considered to be an equivalent qualification. We've heard people say that it is different\u2014it's not the same as an A-level\u2014so, therefore you can't absolutely hold it up and say it's the same as an A-level. kirsty williams am: It's not a question of if this is an equivalent qualification; this is an equivalent qualification. There is a rigorous process that is undertaken to evaluate these qualifications independent of the Government, and it's not a question. Is it a different model and a different way of studying? Yes, of course it is, and that's why we do it. That's why I want children and young people to do both sets of qualifications, because it does engage and expand the acquisition of knowledge and skills. Is it equivalent? Yes, it is, and that's why, since the graded qualification came in, it is regarded by independent bodies as an equivalent to an A-level, and it has a tariff for UCAS in the same way as A-levels would have tariffs. You only have to speak to the institutes of higher education who use this qualification as a way\u00a0of setting grades\u2014you know, offers\u2014for students that they see that in the same way as well. lynne neagle am: Suzy's got a supplementary before we go on to talk in detail about universities. suzy davies am: Is that okay? Because I just want to go back to this element of spoon-feeding at post 16, where you said it's actually very difficult for that to occur, because, obviously, we're talking about the personal project, and so forth. We heard evidence in one of the schools sessions we did that baccalaureate students were being offered a very short and narrow list of subjects on which they could do their personal project, which actually limited the scope of what they were able to do. And we've also heard separately\u2014it may have been with the colleges, I can't quite remember now\u2014that some students were being told, 'On your personal project, just put in what you did for your GCSE-level baccalaureate, and add a few paragraphs.' I'm wondering how easy it is to disguise spoon-feeding at post 16 when we've got two instances there that, to me, suggest it's more about the convenience of the teachers, who perhaps may not be very enthusiastic about the bac, rather than making sure those children get the best out of the qualification. And, again, if I can use my own personal family experience, my daughter has tried that on with her Welsh bac teacher. She's in a different school from where she did her earlier bac, and she said, 'Oh, well, I'll just rehash my \"Votes at 16\" that I did last year', and the Welsh bac teacher has said, 'Under no circumstances are you to do that\u2014no, that's not allowed.'\u00a0This is about using your individual project, linked to something that maybe you hope to study at university, to get the value out of this qualification, and for you to be able to use this in your personal statement, and potentially in an interview. So, again, I guess what this does is show that there's a variation, but certainly, where it is being delivered well, then that practice would not be encouraged, because it would be seen to be\u2014 suzy davies am: It's gaming. kirsty williams am: \u2014denuding the students of the very valuable experience the qualification has to offer. hefin david am: We've had an online survey response, which was quite a stark comment, not from the vice-chancellor's office, but from a member of staff within Cardiff University. And it said: 'The Welsh Bacc is not a fair substitute for a full A-level, and should not be regarded as such. I consider it to be a disadvantage for Welsh students, compared with their English counterparts.' Can you reflect on that? kirsty williams am: I don't agree. hefin david am: Do you think that that's a view that's held within universities, and are you concerned about that? Because it is a view that's obviously held within Cardiff University. kirsty williams am: No; I would say that that is a view held by an individual in Cardiff University\u2014 hefin david am: Who has influence over students. And, actually, Cardiff University\u2014indeed, all Welsh universities\u2014accept the Welsh baccalaureate as an A-level equivalent. I think it is really important to reflect on the wide range of opportunities at higher education that the Welsh bac affords individuals. That means that it is deemed as an equivalent to A-level for the vast majority of universities, to get in to some of the most competitive courses, such as dentistry, medicine, veterinary science. So, those courses where we know there's a high demand and high competition for places, there are institutions that are using that, including Cardiff to get into their medical degree. hefin david am: Nick Brazil, the deputy principal of Gower College, said about 50 per cent of the Russell Group don't value the Welsh bac. kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know where he's getting that from. I spoke again to Cambridge, Oxford, Bath, Southampton, St Andrews, only last week, who were exhibiting at the Seren conference. I specifically took the opportunity to meet with those universities and to talk to them about how they feel about the Welsh bac. First of all, for many of those universities, for many of their courses, they use the Welsh bac as an equivalent to an A-level. If they don't, there are some courses, for instance, where they will lower their offer to gain a place at that university if the Welsh bac is passed at a certain level. So, for instance, rather than maybe offering a Welsh student A, A, B, they would offer a Welsh student A, B, B, plus a Welsh bac, thus giving students two opportunities to gain a place at that university, either with or without their Welsh bac qualification. Even for those universities\u00a0that don't use the Welsh baccalaureate as a formal part of their offer\u2014and this is the conversation I had again last week with Oxford and Cambridge\u2014they value it as part of a student's personal statement; they value it as part of the interview process in which a student may or may not then be offered a place at that university; and they also recognise that the skills learnt by students whilst undertaking the Welsh baccalaureate are exactly the skills that those students\u00a0need to make a successful transition from A-level work to university-type work, which, if you can imagine, is very much based on individual research and being able to guide your own learning. I'm not saying that the\u00a0evidence is conclusive, but it actually demonstrates inconsistency. So, would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities\u00a0use the Welsh bac as a tool for application? kirsty williams am: You would know better than anybody, Hefin, that universities are autonomous institutions and they set their own methods of entry into those institutions. What I'm telling you is that the evidence that I have received from universities is that, whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers, consistently, absolutely across the board, all universities tell me that the Welsh baccalaureate is a valuable qualification and does not disadvantage Welsh\u00a0students. hefin david am: If the committee were to produce a report based on the evidence we've received, that would be contrary to what you've just said. So, I think we'd end up in a debate in which we are setting out different points of view. So, would you therefore commit to exploring that perspective? kirsty williams am: Hefin, I would argue that I have indeed explored that perspective because I have taken the trouble to find out first-hand\u2014not via my officials, but first-hand\u2014from those institutions, their views. So, this is not something that is hearsay; I have undertaken to ascertain the views of those universities. We have written to all vice-chancellors\u2014last year\u2014with regard to the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. Qualifications Wales has an individual whose specific job it is to ensure that universities across the United Kingdom understand the value of Welsh qualifications. But I have to say that the evidence that I have from universities is that the Welsh baccalaureate, whilst it may be used in different ways in terms of an offer, the consistency from all universities is that it is a valuable qualification. If you've heard differently from admissions tutors and from the universities officially, rather than from somebody who has e-mailed in, then I would be pleased to look at that evidence, because it would be in stark contrast to what I am being told by universities. lynne neagle am: Hefin\u00a0is not referring to an e-mail\u2014 hefin david am: No, I've said that. lynne neagle am: \u2014we did do a survey and we've also taken oral evidence. kirsty williams am: And I'm presenting you with the evidence that I've received. hefin david am: But it will be presented to you as a submission from this committee, no doubt. You do concede that there is inconsistency with how admissions offers are made with regard to the skills challenge certificate. How would you suggest that that is addressed? kirsty williams am: Hefin, each individual\u00a0institution\u00a0and university the length and breadth of the UK have different ways in which they make offers to individuals. So, for instance, it is accepted as a third-grade offer in Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, the London School of Economics\u2014some of the highest performing universities and Russell\u00a0Group universities. It is accepted as a fourth qualification or amends the offer in places like Bath University, and it is accepted in tariff-point offers in places like Hull and the University of the West of England. So there is a variety of ways in which universities use the qualification, and that is their prerogative\u2014that's their prerogative as institutions.\u00a0They will have different ways in which they recruit and how they offer places, just like different universities will have different views on unconditional offers. You know, there's a difference in universities there, isn't there? Some universities don't have unconditional offers at all; other universities\u2014 hefin david am: So, what you're saying is that the problem isn't connected to the Welsh bac, it's connected with just the way that universities make offers, and the Welsh bac\u00a0has got nothing to do with it. What I\u2019m saying to you is that, in the conversations that I have had with Russell Group universities, what they say is that there is certainly no detriment to any Welsh student\u00a0undertaking this qualification. And therefore, I think it is a myth\u2014I would go as far as to say that it\u2019s a myth\u2014that Welsh students are disadvantaged in any way by taking this qualification. andrew clark: Could I just add to that response? There are, obviously, differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the Welsh baccalaureate, which is the prime focus of this. andrew clark: And even those who do not make it part of their offer consider it exceedingly valuable in the way that young people are prepared to go to university and, therefore, as part of their personal statement, as part of their interview, the activity that the young person has taken by means of the skills challenge certificate is definitely recognised, even by those who don\u2019t actually make it part of their offer. So, we\u2019re still on a journey\u2014that graded qualification\u00a0has only been taught for a couple of years, but the journey is taking us to the right place, towards the right destination. So, it isn\u2019t just about variable admissions practices across universities; it is to deal with the skills challenge certificate as well, which needed changing in order to improve that. When it was a 'yes'/'no' qualification, I think they held it in less regard than they do now that it is a graded qualification. kirsty williams am: And that\u2019s\u00a0the conversation we had with some of our Russell Group universities. So, last question, then: are you absolutely confident that any concerns we are offering are nothing really to worry about? kirsty williams am: We will need to continue to communicate to all audiences the importance of this and the value of this qualification. But I am confident that the university sector, in its wide variety of forms, regards the Welsh baccalaureate qualification as a valuable endeavour for Welsh students to undertake, and they certainly don\u2019t regard it as a detriment to students. Si\u00e2n wants to come in on this, and then I've got a question from Suzy on Seren. sian gwenllian am: Yes, just that the committee, of course, has been trying to gain evidence on this sector from the universities themselves, but Universities Wales, which represents the interests of universities in Wales, has rejected the committee's invitation to submit any oral or written evidence. So, can you see the dilemma we're in? We are hearing a few things coming from some universities, we hear what you're saying, but we can't get to the root of the matter because the universities themselves aren't willing to come to speak to us. Are you also disappointed that they have rejected our invitation to come and speak to us? hefin david am: Where's the enthusiasm, Chair? Where's the enthusiasm? sian gwenllian am: And perhaps that's a sign that they don't want to be drawn into this argument between the Government and us as a committee. kirsty williams am: Well, it\u2019s a matter for individual universities to decide whether they want to participate in the work of this committee. All Welsh universities regard the Welsh baccalaureate as an equivalent to A-level, and all universities use it as part of their offer\u2014Welsh universities. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but you see what our dilemma is, though, because if we can\u2019t actually ask them directly,\u00a0it's a bit\u00a0difficult for us to actually probe this and to help move things on? Anyway, I'll leave it at that. kirsty williams am: Well, it's a matter for them, and maybe the Chair would like to take that up with Universities Wales. suzy davies am: So, just briefly, you\u2019ve said several times that having a Welsh bac qualification is an advantage and certainly no detriment, and that it\u2019s valued by universities. But advantage isn't\u00a0the same\u00a0as equivalence, and we have had evidence from\u2014I think it was Cardiff University, again, where they had students with two A-levels and a bac who were actually performing as weaker students. So, even though on the face of it you've got three A-levels, those particular students aren't matching up to the expectations of a student with three A-levels. I do want to challenge what you said about the students who are involved in the Seren network about the baccalaureate being accepted for things like veterinary medicine and medicine itself. We've had evidence from FE colleges, which are now significant players in producing our Seren-style students, if you like, that they are exempting their students from doing the bac\u00a0because it's a distraction, effectively. What's your comment on that? Because if this is a question of communication, which I suspect you're about to tell me, one of the axioms of good communication is you can have the best marketing in the world, but if the product you're selling isn't highly valued then you're actually just doubling the problem. So, can you explain to me why FE is exempting their highest flyers from doing the bac? kirsty williams am: I think sometimes colleges make the decision that four or five A-levels is of an advantage, and therefore, if you're asking students to carry that workload, which is a considerable workload, that's the preferred route for more able and talented students. Again, what is quite clear in all the conversations that I have had with Russell Group universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, is that this is a myth. What universities tell me they want is not necessarily students with four or five A-levels; they want students with three really exceptional grades at A-level and a Welsh baccalaureate. I think that's really, really an important message to get across\u2014that it is not necessary to do four or five A-levels if you aspire to go to these Russell Group universities, or if you decide you want to apply to Oxford and Cambridge. As I said, in the conversations that we have had\u2014and there is actually some research, and I will let the committee have links to the research. There is some research to suggest that those students who have been involved in project-based work\u2014and, of course, that's not just the Welsh baccalaureate, that would be the EPQ, which is a qualification that is rapidly gaining traction in England. That is an extended project\u2014research based\u2014qualification, very similar to the individual project element of the Welsh baccalaureate. The EPQ\u00a0in England is seen as a qualification taken by more able and talented students, and what we see in some of the research that is coming forward is that those students who have engaged in that type of work, project-based work, individual-led, research-based work\u2014those skills are the skills that are really attuned to the nature of university-type work. Therefore, that is valued by universities and there is some indication to say that there is a correlation between the students who have undertaken that work and their potential success at undergraduate level. They also tell me that there is a link between, for instance, being able then to use those skills to gain work experience, placements and internships in the private sector and in the world of work, because, as I said, those types of skills are really, really valuable and therefore that's why they value the qualification. suzy davies am: Can I just add\u2014? It's great that they're telling you, why aren't they telling FE? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said, I think it's really important that FE colleges understand that there is a myth around the fact that these universities are looking for four or five A-levels, and if that's the reason why then colleges are not allowing students or dissuading students from taking the Welsh bac, I think we need to reflect on what's important to those universities\u2014which is the right A-levels. I think it's really, really important that students are given the best advice about the A-levels they need to take, facilitating subjects to get into a university, and the value of the skills and knowledge they will acquire through the Welsh bac\u00a0as an assistance to them going forward. suzy davies am: I'll try and keep this on the shorter side, if that's okay, everybody. You say in your evidence that you expect universal\u00a0adoption, basically, by 2020, I think it is, or it might be 2019. What do you think universal adoption actually means? What does it look like? Does it mean 100 per cent adoption? kirsty williams am: What is means is that I expect all institutions to be in a position to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate. I believe it should be an entitlement to all Welsh students to be able to study this qualification, and I believe we should work to the situation where it becomes the norm to take the Welsh baccalaureate. I also recognise that in some individual cases, there may be very good reasons why perhaps this is not aligned to the well-being of that particular student. But when I talk about universal adoption, I expect all our institutions to be in a position to deliver the qualification, and I believe it should be an entitlement for Welsh students\u00a0to be able to undertake this qualification. suzy davies am: But not an obligation\u2014that's the bit I'm trying to get at. kirsty williams am: I think it should\u00a0become the norm, and if there are exceptions to that, and there could well be for very legitimate reasons, I think that that flexibility should be allowed. But I think, for those students who are not doing that Welsh baccalaureate, there should be evidence as to why that decision has been taken. I think the performance measures, probably, are likely to sharpen the minds of some school leaders, so I won't\u00a0pursue that. But can you tell me what lesson you may have learnt from the universal obligation for students to study Welsh language in schools\u00a0when those schools weren't particularly ready to offer a quality course? kirsty williams am: As we've rehearsed\u00a0earlier, it is important that all of our schools and colleges are in a position\u00a0to deliver this qualification well and deliver a really positive experience to learners. That's why there is existing support available, and via our new professional learning programmes there will be more support available for teachers to ensure that they have the skills and the confidence to deliver the qualification in a high-quality manner. Would you consider\u00a0pausing the presumption of universal\u00a0roll-out until you're absolutely sure that all institutions are able to offer the bac to the quality\u00a0that you would like to see it delivered? kirsty williams am: Not at this stage. We have evidence that schools are already delivering the qualification\u00a0really well\u2014 suzy davies am: But you know that we've had evidence, and you must have as well, that not all schools are doing it. I don't know\u00a0why we would turn round and say that this qualification needs to be stopped\u00a0when we wouldn't\u00a0stop other qualifications, and we'd say, 'Well, there we are, we haven't got a 100 per cent guarantee that every single school is delivering this particular qualification especially\u00a0well, therefore we're going to denude the opportunity of students to study that particular subject.' What we're saying is, 'There is a responsibility\u00a0on us, on individual schools and on our regional consortia to endure that there is professional learning in place so that all schools are in a position to deliver the qualification well.' suzy davies am: Isn't it irresponsible to ask students to be obliged to take a qualification that's badly delivered? kirsty williams am: What is irresponsible is not to invest in professional\u00a0learning to ensure that all schools are in a position to deliver it well. Well, I agree with you on that, actually, which is why I was a bit confused when you had some in-year additional money in this year's budget that was being given\u00a0out to consortia rather than to schools to improve the ability of their teachers to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate in certain schools.",
        " Can you tell me whether the money\u2014I think it was about \u00a35 million that was going to the consortia\u00a0in-year\u2014will you will offer them suggestions that that is used for improving baccalaureate teaching? kirsty williams am: The money that is available is going via consortia to schools. And if that school understands that they have particular professional learning needs for the Welsh baccalaureate, then I would expect the money to be spent on that. Where a school is doing the Welsh baccalaureate particularly well, then the school might identify other areas where they look to seek improvement. We can't second-guess that, and therefore it has to be right that school leaders are able to plan the professional learning of their staff accordingly. suzy davies am: I completely accept that and, as I say, it's\u00a0not for all schools, but bearing in mind we're facing evidence of polarisation of delivery, I'm\u00a0just wondering whether there wasn't a letter\u00a0suggesting\u00a0that they may want to focus on this in the schools that aren't delivering this well at the moment. kirsty williams am: Well, again, that's a conversation to be had between challenge advisors in our regional\u00a0consortia who are aware of the strengths\u00a0and weaknesses in individual\u00a0schools, in conjunction with the leadership of those schools, to discuss how that professional\u00a0learning money is best spent. There isn't a school that is fantastic at everything, nor is there a school that is not good at anything, if you know\u00a0what . It is for the regional consortia, via challenge advisers, and the headteacher, to have that conversation about what the professional learning needs are for that particular school, to ensure that all their teachers, across the length and breadth of the curriculum, are in a position to deliver good-quality lessons. kevin palmer: Can I just make a further comment? I'll be this afternoon meeting with the regional consortia, Estyn, the universities, and the rest of what we call 'the middle tier' to discuss with them the configuration of a national curriculum for professional learning, premised on the priorities that are emerging from our current work with pioneer schools. And the shifts in pedagogy that you all know is found behind some of these issues, with the delivery of the Welsh bac, those shifts in pedagogy are right at the core of the national approach to professional learning\u2014so, things like project-based learning, the kinds of things you talked about today, moving away from a spoon-feeding model, not just for the Welsh bac but actually right across the curriculum. So, it's absolutely true to say that each individual school is different, each individual practitioner is different, but we must give the regions and the HEIs, as it were, a menu of things, and guidance around where there are clearly weaknesses in schools. suzy davies am: I accept that we're going forward towards Donaldson, and I'm sure that you will be getting questions on that at some time in the future. I'm more concerned about this bac\u00a0that's been around for 10 years, and there's still, as far as we can tell from the evidence that we've had, poor delivery in some schools, where there's the prospect of obligation on the horizon. lynne neagle am: I think the issue of the difference between entitlement and obligation is a very important one and is a concern to students. You were saying it's an entitlement, not an obligation, but we have had very clear evidence from colleges that some of them are making young people do it, and schools are making young people do it. So, what do you say to those schools that are insisting on their pupils doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at post 16? kirsty williams am: As I said, I hope that it becomes the norm that at post-16 level students take the Welsh baccalaureate, because I think it is of huge value. There may be circumstances that mean that the well-being of that student could be compromised by making them do this qualification. There could be a whole host of reasons why it is not suitable for a child to take this qualification, and therefore there has to be some flexibility in the system, and we have to trust in the professional leadership of our colleges and our headteachers to make that decision in the round, with the pupil and their parents, about what's in the best interests of those pupils. But I do think a situation where, perhaps, an entire cohort of students are suddenly deemed it's unsuitable for, I find that very hard to believe, but there could well be circumstances, for a whole host of reasons, where that particular qualification\u2014. And we would not want to jeopardise the well-being of a student by forcing them to do a qualification that wasn't in their best interests, and we need to have the flexibility in the system to allow school leaders to make that decision, but they should also then be accountable for that decision. lynne neagle am: But do you recognise there's maybe a case for strengthening guidance, then, on this? Because, we've had teachers tell us that they have insisted on pupils doing this, and then the parents have rung Welsh Government, and they felt undermined, then. So, do you think there's a case for strengthening the guidance or clarifying what the position is to schools and colleges? kirsty williams am: Very happy to do that. As I said, from time to time, parents do indeed contact Welsh Government, and in that contact there is a whole variety of reasons why that parent feels the Welsh baccalaureate is not in the best interests of those children. Sometimes, that can go from the extreme of,\u00a0'I want my child to do five A-levels and I think that's in their best interest to get into Oxford and Cambridge'\u2014I would argue that that is a myth, around the need to do that many A-levels\u2014through to, 'Actually, my child has a range of learning needs, and actually this qualification isn't suited to them. Making them go out and do voluntary work in an organisation with people that don't understand their needs and they are unfamiliar with could jeopardise\u00a0my child's ability and my child's well-being.' So, there's a whole range of reasons why sometimes people have concerns about the Welsh baccalaureate. Sometimes, they're based on information that, perhaps, isn't correct, or the myths around, 'I need to do five A-levels if I want to go to Cambridge'. I'm aware of a case last year where a parent felt very concerned that the students were also having to study for entrance exams into Cambridge. They were able to allow the student extra time to study for that qualification and pick up their Welsh bac work later on in the academic year. I'm very pleased to say that we've had correspondence from said parent to say that his son went on to do exceptionally well in his A-levels and his Welsh baccalaureate and gained his place at Cambridge University, and that's about having the flexibility, even at a school level, to be able to respond to the needs of individual students. As you know, mental health and the emotional health of our children and young people is a very core issue for this committee, and Estyn have said that studying the skills challenge certificate alongside three or four A-levels is a significant factor in causing stress for some young people. How do you respond to that? kirsty williams am: Well, I would be the first to acknowledge that studying A-levels can be a very stressful time. That's because students, rightly, regard those qualifications as high stakes and as having a profound effect on the opportunities for the rest of their lives. So, the mere fact of studying A-levels can be a really stressful time for students because they understand how important they are, and students want to do well and they want to be able to move on to the next stage, either of work or of university. We also know\u2014and Estyn\u00a0reflects this\u2014that students are also often trying to combine that with part-time jobs. These students are of an age when they want to be out and about and earning some of their own money and being a bit more independent. So, undoubtedly, this is a stressful time in young people's lives and we need to ensure that there is support in school to support young people through this time to make sure that students are making the right choices in terms of their A-levels and the qualifications that they're doing so they're not having to do more because they're under the impression that, by doing more, that's going to make them more likely to succeed. What we know, actually, is it's about the quality of what you do rather than the entirety of what you do that's important to universities, and we need to make sure that students are getting really good information, advice and guidance and support at what is a challenging time in their lives, because, of course, it comes on top of working really hard for your GCSEs and then you have, the following year, AS-level examinations and A-level examinations after that. So, these are stressful times in children's lives and they realise the importance of these as high-stakes qualifications. janet finch-saunders am: This is about the wider impact of studying the Welsh bac\u00a0on other curriculum subjects and education provision, and we've had representations in that it is causing some concerns. So, do you have any concerns about the effect that the Welsh bac\u00a0may be having on wider education provisions, such as the narrowing of the curriculum at key stage 4? kirsty williams am: No. Obviously, schools are responsible for planning their local curriculum offer, and that needs to meet the needs of their learners, and it also needs to meet the needs of the Learning and Skills (Wales) Measure 2009. I believe that the skills challenge certificate actually does ensure that there is a broad curriculum and that children are exposed to different learning opportunities. And so, rather than narrowing it, I believe the Welsh bac\u00a0helps us to make sure that there is an expansive curriculum, and that lots of different issues are explored in the skills challenge certificate that ensure not just academic skills are developed, but, actually, knowledge and skills of a wider range of subjects about you and your place in the world is available via this qualification. And then, to what extent do you think that the Welsh bac\u00a0should be give priority over other curriculum subjects? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't think it's\u2014. It should be part of that wide range of opportunities that are afforded to students, and I don't think it's more important\u00a0or less important than\u00a0other aspects of what we already ask schools to deliver. janet finch-saunders am: What about where we've taken representations that there's a lack of capacity in terms of all the extra pressures of studying the Welsh bac along with other qualifications? I went to a school in Bangor, and, again, as has been said here, it's very polarised, the evidence that we're taking\u2014either some have found it very easy or some, including teachers, have found it extremely difficult to fit everything in, and they do believe that there is a lack of capacity there. kirsty williams am: And the onerous nature and the consequences of workload for teachers is acknowledged by the Qualifications Wales work and review into the qualification, and that is one of the things that we're looking to address so that the assessment arrangements and workload implications for teachers are not too onerous. And, if there is any element of duplication\u2014students being asked to do things over and over\u2014then that needs to be addressed as well, and that's why there is this review by the design group. And then, how do you respond to concerns that learners are avoiding studying the Welsh bac\u2014 where they can, that is\u2014by\u00a0attending institutions in England or institutions that do not offer Welsh-medium provision? kirsty williams am: Well, it's interesting, isn't it, about where children choose to study and whether they are motivated by the avoidance of the Welsh bac? People make decisions about where to study for a whole host of reasons, and it's difficult sometimes to quantify what those are. The geography is not easy, but it can be relatively easy to go across into the English system and therefore you don't have to do this. We know that, in some of our rural schools, the secondary sixth forms aren't able to offer a wide variety of A-levels, and perhaps, by going to a different institution, a larger institution across the way, then you can get that combination of the A-levels you want to do, which simply isn't possible if you do it in your home school. Or, we do have some consortia arrangements where A-levels are delivered across a wide variety of schools, which require students to travel. Some students don't want to do that; they don't want to do their A-levels in three different schools, but they'd rather go to an institution where they can do it all under one roof. And that means, sometimes, moving across the border or, in the area I live, children making the decision to go to Merthyr college, because its a lovely, beautiful new building, the facilities are absolutely fantastic and a wide variety of A-levels is available under one roof. So, if we take the example of King Henry VIII School in Abergavenny, a school where, in the past, there have been, I think, within the community, some concerns about the quality of that school\u2014whether it's regarded as a good school. And, from that particular location, you can quite easily get to Hereford college\u2014a college that has a fantastic offer, does very, very well and has a beautiful building. What we do, if we look at the tracking of the students who have been retained in King Henry VIII, as that school has been on its improvement journey and has done better and better and better, the number of students that they are retaining into their sixth form has grown. So, the perception is, 'This is a good school, I'm going to get a good-quality experience here', and more and more students are choosing to stay in that school than perhaps make the decision to travel somewhere else. We also have to recognise that, for some students, staying in the sixth form isn't what they want to do; they want a different experience, they want to go to an FE college. So, we have to take into consideration that students could be motivated by a wide variety of subjects, and there's no hard-and-fast evidence that it is avoidance of the bac\u00a0that is the sole driver for some of these choices. sian gwenllian am: The evidence that we've had from one of the teaching unions\u2014robust and clear evidence\u2014is that this is happening, that is, that young people are leaving Wales to go over the border to schools in England in order to avoid the Welsh bac. I'm saying that I think\u00a0there are a wide variety of reasons\u00a0why students make decisions about where to study. I'm not aware of any comprehensive piece of work that has looked at those motivations, and I think there could be a whole host of reasons why children are deciding to move across the border. Perhaps the Welsh bac is an easy one to place that hook on, and that's easier to acknowledge, isn't it, than saying that perhaps students are making that choice for other reasons. lynne neagle am: Okay, you don't want to\u2014 suzy davies am: By all means you ask the others I had. One is about preparedness in ITE to teach the Welsh bac, so I don't know if you want to expand on how teachers are being skilled up at that level to deliver the Welsh bac effectively. kirsty williams am: In the accreditation process, which has not been without its pain, and some significant decisions made in that regard, the criteria for the ITE programmes note that, and I'm going to quote it: 'Teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning, bringing together different aspects to examine, for example, important topics such as citizenship, enterprise, financial capability and sustainability.' So, the prime driver for our ITE reforms, obviously, is the preparedness for 'Successful Futures', but in preparing our teachers to be in a position to successfully deliver that, those are also the pedagogical principles and that shift in pedagogy that we see aligned to the Welsh baccalaureate. So, it is actually a part of the accreditation process that the curriculum that the new ITE providers will have to deliver\u2014ensuring that teachers have those skills and have that confidence to be able to deliver their teaching in a way that, as I said, ensures that we successfully deliver on Donaldson, but also on the same pedagogical principles that are needed for the successful delivery of the Welsh bac. suzy davies am: In the pre-Donaldson period, then, bearing in mind what you've just said, do you expect to see a surge in improvement on how the baccalaureate is taken up by those schools that are currently less keen on it? kirsty williams am: I hope that we will see increased numbers of students taking the qualification and an increase in the quality of that experience for young people. As we discussed earlier, we're not just waiting for the new graduates to come out of our ITE providers. They should be given an equal opportunity to ensure that they have the skills to deliver on our curriculum reforms and our reform qualifications, and every time the previous Government has brought in a reformed qualification there have been specific resources made available to ensure that teachers are in a position to do that. So, when we changed to maths numeracy, a new qualification that was to be examined, there was specific resource made available for the professional learning for teachers to make sure that they were in a position to do that, and that's exactly the same as the offer that we have available for teachers who are delivering the Welsh bac. And you've already said about continuing professional development, that this is going to be a core part of the CPD. Is there anything that you want to add on that? Is it going to be fully integrated into the professional learning offer? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. There is already\u2014I don't want to make the impression that there's not already support available out there. There is existing support available from the WJEC with regard to Welsh baccalaureate, and it will continue, as we drive forward our national approach to professional learning. And, increasingly, there are interesting ways in which we're supporting students, so I don't know if Members are aware of the new MOOC. The University of Bath, one of the Russell Group universities, delivered a MOOC for the extended project qualification in England. lynne neagle am: What's a MOOC? [Laughter.] kirsty williams am: So, it is an online\u2014a massive open online course. So, it's a course that is delivered free of charge, and it's delivered by information technology. They have just launched, in conjunction with Aberystwyth University, a bilingual MOOC for the individual project for Welsh bac. It's our understanding it is the first ever Welsh-medium MOOC, we think; we're not aware of any others. And this resource is there for students to give them advice on how they do choose the thesis for their individual project: how do you go about, then, undertaking good independent research; how do you reference properly, to ensure that you do that correctly? And we've seen over 1,000 students already sign up for the MOOC. So, increasingly, there are lots and lots of new resources out there for both teachers and students to make the most of. And the fact that Bath and Aberystwyth have worked together on this, I believe, shows their commitment and a demonstration of their support for this qualification, otherwise why would the University of Bath bother, if they weren't interested in it? lynne neagle am: Okay. I've written to you about a young constituent who moved institutions and resat the Welsh bac, but wasn't able, because of the WJEC\u00a0policy, to obtain a higher grade in it, because they've got a policy that the grade is capped when you resit it. Given what the committee's been told about the variability in\u00a0the way this is taught in institutions in Wales, do you think it's fair that young people shouldn't be able to go and resit it somewhere else and get a better grade? kirsty williams am: Well, given that Welsh Ministers are independent of the qualification system, I would want to be careful about what I said, because it is for the WJEC\u00a0and Qualifications Wales to regulate this. But, clearly, we would want to reflect on making sure that students have an opportunity, and a fair opportunity. Andrew, I don't know if you've got any observations that you'd like to make. I think it's an individual case, this one\u2014 lynne neagle am: But it could apply to lots of young people, couldn't it? , that's the point here. I know it's a constituent's case and I don't normally raise those in the Chair, but I think, given what we've learned about variability, it is a valid issue for young people in Wales, really. andrew clark: Yes, whether it's particularly related to the Welsh baccalaureate, though, I'm not so certain. And I think that would be a better question to ask the WJEC, perhaps, and Qualifications Wales, because it's a deliberate act that that activity is at arm's length from Welsh Ministers. Okay, well, can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and her officials for attending? We've had a very useful discussion this morning, which will inform our report on this. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, but thank you again for your attendance. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Llywydd to the First Minister on the role of the Assembly in the process of legislating for Brexit. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education and the Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning with additional information following the meeting on 8 November. Are Members happy to note those? suzy davies am: Can I just make a comment on the first of those letters, the one from the Llywydd? I recommend to Assembly Members that they read that again if they can, because, actually, it's an important issue that is easily lost in the other things that we talk about with Brexit, and that is the role of this Assembly in scrutinising secondary legislation falling out of Brexit. hefin david am: Can I ask a question? Was that a reflection of all the Chairs? lynne neagle am: Yes. It came to the panel of Chairs\u2014 hefin david am: And it was obviously unanimous\u2014 lynne neagle am: \u2014and we agreed that we wanted that letter sent. Item 4 is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting"

    [
        "Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work? julie morgan am: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it\u2019s important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. hefin david am: So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development? julie morgan am: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. julie morgan am: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it\u2019s probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do. hefin david am: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government\u2019s approach 'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.' And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen? julie morgan am: Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it\u2019s absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it\u2019s grown up from all different routes. We have got pathway projects in, I think it\u2019s eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things. Can I just come back to the first thing you said: 'We can't say yet what we're going to do'? julie morgan am: No. hefin david am: So, when will we have a policy plan and something that we can interrogate in more detail? julie morgan am: Well, I think we are near getting to an announcement where we will be able to say what direction we're going in, and because we have had\u2014. Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon. And finally from me\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm sorry I can't say too much about that because we haven't actually\u2014. And if that's as far as you're willing to go, then I'll stop asking. sian gwenllian am: I just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work? julie morgan am: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. , actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes? sian gwenllian am: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014? jo-anne daniels: So, in 'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire\u2014and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven\u2014who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home. sian gwenllian am: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach? jo-anne daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded. lynne neagle am: And how long have they been going for? jo-anne daniels: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in\u2014I think it was\u2014February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years. julie morgan am: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention. hefin david am: In your report, the 'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that 'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth? julie morgan am: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about \u00a381 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing\u00a0childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within 'Prosperity for All' and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. hefin david am: And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue? julie morgan am: Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and,for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales? julie morgan am: Right. , obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas. lynne neagle am: Before you move on, Janet, Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. sian gwenllian am: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase? julie morgan am: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. sian gwenllian am: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day. julie morgan am: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded. janet finch-saunders am: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available? julie morgan am: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so,in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that? janet finch-saunders am: I know that\u2014we've just had a useful briefing from\u00a0David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group? julie morgan am: It is demand\u2014 nicola edwards: [Inaudible.]\u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Yes, yes. nicola edwards: \u2014obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. julie morgan am: It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody. lynne neagle am: I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. julie morgan am: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys M\u00f4n was nearly 90 per cent or something\u2014 sian gwenllian am: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding. julie morgan am: In other areas, it's much, much lower\u2014in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that? julie morgan am: We are planning to extend it. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation\u00a0of that.\u00a0It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. janet finch-saunders am: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured? julie morgan am: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. janet finch-saunders am: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales? julie morgan am: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to\u2014 nicola edwards: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage. suzy davies am: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on? nicola edwards: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way. lynne neagle am: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only? nicola edwards: We will have. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. lynne neagle am: Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact? julie morgan am: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information. dawn bowden am: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future? julie morgan am: No, I'm not surprised at all. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody\u2014so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up. dawn bowden am: I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare. julie morgan am: Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to\u2014. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare. Before\u2014 lynne neagle am: Are you going to move on? Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand? julie morgan am: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of \u00a350 million to \u00a355 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of \u00a340 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys M\u00f4n, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. So, I'm not quite sure what 'on the cusp' of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what 'on the cusp of returning to work' is\u2014what that means from your perspective\u2014and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion? julie morgan am: Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments\u2014that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the\u2014 dawn bowden am: Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well. julie morgan am: Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said\u2014the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education\u2014and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies\u2014who are\u2014the letters may have come in from some of your constituents\u2014not able to access the offer as things stand. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on 'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently\u2014those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on. dawn bowden am: So, what are the\u2014? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at? julie morgan am: Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression 'on the cusp of work' we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate\u2014 dawn bowden am: Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly\u2014 julie morgan am: No, this review will report early next year. My final question\u2014 lynne neagle am: Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries.",
        " suzy davies am: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work? julie morgan am: Have you got some information on that? nicola edwards: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think 'secured' is probably a slightly premature phrase. suzy davies am: Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years. julie morgan am: As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials. julie morgan am: It's all in the process\u2014 lynne neagle am: And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously. sian gwenllian am: How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents? julie morgan am: We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean. sian gwenllian am: Do we know how many children we're talking about? nicola edwards: Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings. nicola edwards: It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work. lynne neagle am: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference? julie morgan am: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. dawn bowden am: Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that? julie morgan am: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of \u00a35.6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of\u2014 julie morgan am: Well, we don't know what's happening with that\u2014 dawn bowden am: \u2014what would happen beyond that. julie morgan am: \u2014funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite. sian gwenllian am: As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money\u2014\u00a31 million, I understand\u2014has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC? julie morgan am:  sian gwenllian am: Yes. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular\u00a0view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was\u2014 julie morgan am: It would have restricted us a lot. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail\u2014going through HMRC would put limits on that. julie morgan am: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it. sian gwenllian am: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties\u2014 julie morgan am: One of the major reasons, I think\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards. julie morgan am: Do you want to add something to this? nicola edwards: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called 'special characters' in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. sian gwenllian am: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there\u2014 nicola edwards: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was\u2014. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that. julie morgan am: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. , there are other things with using HMRC\u2014if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. jo-anne daniels: The only thing I'd add is that\u2014and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this\u2014the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that\u2014that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here. sian gwenllian am: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option\u2014and this is only going back a few months\u2014because it will remove\u2014and this is quoting them\u2014 'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'\u2014 blah, blah, blah, blah.\u00a0So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know\u2014. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence\u2014we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now. julie morgan am: I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases\u2014I certainly have\u2014where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this? jo-anne daniels: So, at the moment, local\u2014. jo-anne daniels: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation.\u00a0Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. suzy davies am: Could you give us an idea of the price tag? jo-anne daniels: At the moment, it's about \u00a32.5 million. jo-anne daniels: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC. suzy davies am: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures. sian gwenllian am: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer? jo-anne daniels: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things? nicola edwards: They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that. Si\u00e2n, do you want to ask about the Welsh language? sian gwenllian am: I think we've\u2014. lynne neagle am: Really\u2014? sian gwenllian am: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened. lynne neagle am: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems. lynne neagle am: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning? nicola edwards: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers' standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with. lynne neagle am: I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please? julie morgan am: Would we have any idea? nicola edwards: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment? julie morgan am: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely. suzy davies am: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area. julie morgan am: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that: 'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government\u2019s work on the Early Years system.' That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering? julie morgan am: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension\u2014 suzy davies am: With limits, yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. suzy davies am: I accept what you say about the current system\u2014 julie morgan am: I believe it's much more\u2014. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that\u2014unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children\u2014on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment? julie morgan am: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five\u2014that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas? julie morgan am: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas\u2014I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that\u2014? Do you know the actual percentage? suzy davies am: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but\u2014 jo-anne daniels: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty.FootnoteLink suzy davies am: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is\u2014basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it? jo-anne daniels: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second\u2014oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course\u2014in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can\u2019t prove it? jo-anne daniels: We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we\u2019ve been working with the SAIL\u2014secure anonymised information linkage\u2014and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children\u2019s progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions. suzy davies am: We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage? julie morgan am: Just in terms of what we\u2019re thinking of doing with Flying Start\u2014. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we\u2019re looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities\u2014we talked about that earlier\u2014so, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. We do want to make it available to more children, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with\u2014 suzy davies am: No, no\u2014we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected? julie morgan am: Do we know why? jo-anne daniels: So, the approach that we\u2019ve taken to evaluation in Flying Start\u2014. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you\u2019re familiar with the work that, as I say, we\u2019ve been doing with SAIL. We\u2019re currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child\u2019s chances have improved primarily because they\u2019re getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There\u2019s got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky\u2014in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so\u2014 suzy davies am: And that's why we need to know who is. jo-anne daniels: Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do. Just on the final point from me\u2014yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition\u2014taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion,\u00a0for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire? julie morgan am: I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year\u2014 suzy davies am: So, what have they told you? julie morgan am: \u2014and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop. suzy davies am: Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to\u2014well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that\u2014 julie morgan am: Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. suzy davies am: Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago. julie morgan am: In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries\u2014it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided? lynne neagle am: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course\u2014we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really. julie morgan am: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting\u2014again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "Okay and the agenda will be the opening and  that's  the product manager or secretary that's me and  the presentations from the Christine and  Agnes and from Mister Ed . And finally in this meeting we have to decide marketing: project manager: and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and  the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's  little bit  low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about  the components concept . So  project manager: industrial designer: we were looking he specifically at the components  the following components ,  the case , the power supply ,  the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , project manager: industrial designer: you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , but  maybe you do have it a a way marketing: industrial designer: it has to it has to hear the speaker user interface: industrial designer: and  , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone ,  and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Our method for going about this is we've looked at  the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also  we wanted to evaluate some new materials marketing: industrial designer: and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so  this is the approach that we took during our  our research . marketing: industrial designer: So  for the case ,  we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . marketing: industrial designer: Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but  that  doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can  we can really seriously explore , user interface: industrial designer: so then we were thinking about  rubber , but  unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat  factor user interface: industrial designer: and th  there might be some problems with the m  how it's  goes with the board .  and  then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , user interface: industrial designer: so  we still had titanium and and wood available , but  unfortunately   titanium's also been eliminated  , user interface: industrial designer: the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but  nevertheless  they've eliminated all of our options except wood . marketing: industrial designer: And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly  material , so we're we're currently  proposing , marketing: industrial designer:  we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . marketing: industrial designer: So then there's this other matter of the chips and  well we could use a simple design on the board , user interface: project manager: industrial designer:  these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much  intelligence with this simple one . And  then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one .  the other option was this advanced chip on print , and  we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , marketing: industrial designer: which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . marketing: industrial designer: And  manufacturing has told us that they've   recently developed a  a sensor and a speaker that would  be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so  we we  now jumping right to our personal preferences  I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of  some really exotic woods , like  , user interface: industrial designer: you know  , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this  three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I  think we should go with the solar cells as well as the  microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research marketing: industrial designer: and my recommendations  for the new remote control w  would be to have  have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ? project manager: Can you go back  one slide ? industrial designer: I'm not sure , how do I Oh , I know , let's see . project manager: Yes ,  question , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ? industrial designer: I think it's   a multiple  chip design  and it's  maybe printed on to the circuit board . project manager: Yeah , is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or  industrial designer: I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . project manager: Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . user interface: Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? industrial designer: Because  it gets brittle , cracks user interface: user interface: industrial designer: I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . user interface: Although I think marketing: user interface: I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you ,  it chips , it if you drop it , industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  it's I'm not su industrial designer: project manager: So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . user interface: industrial designer: you're what ? marketing: Actually , I'm ready to sell it . user interface: I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , marketing: I'm ready to sell it . industrial designer: You think ? And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . user interface: but you can't just use marketing: No y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , user interface: Yeah , exactly , yeah . industrial designer: Well I'm glad you user interface: marketing: That's actually very innovative idea . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that  you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . marketing:  it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . user interface: project manager: Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design  , what about yo you ? marketing: user interface: in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own project manager: Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first marketing: In turns of wow . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer: She works in the cubicle next to me so she's  she was already a little bit prepared for this . user interface: marketing: Wood ? user interface: I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . marketing: user interface: One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having  industrial designer: Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your user interface: Yeah , for example . So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , marketing: industrial designer: It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . user interface: but marketing: user interface: marketing: They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , industrial designer: Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , which basically shows , sort of marketing: user interface: I took the ideas that we were talking about last time  and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .  , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , marketing: user interface: so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . user interface: And also  you had issues with the batteries running out , marketing: user interface: so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and  tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . user interface: So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like marketing: user interface: Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ project manager: user interface: and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . user interface: so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip thing and Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . project manager: user interface: which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . user interface: But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . user interface: So , that's pretty much all I had to say , everything else in terms of design issues .  the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and  the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , industrial designer: user interface: So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause  trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . This is what we know from the last  from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that  , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . The second one , there is about  forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read ,  very hard to use . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: The first one , I see that they put in a display . Now there's something else  with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , user interface: marketing: but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . marketing: Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display user interface: industrial designer: Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . marketing: Okay Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , user interface: Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and marketing: yeah . marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good ,  with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours user interface: industrial designer: user interface: project manager: industrial designer: You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like  a   b some sort of a foam rubber  ball , marketing: we might've user interface: Oh yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific industrial designer: To t an and then you would know like  what the geometry of their hands would be and  marketing: project manager: marketing: How hard they squeeze ? user interface: industrial designer: Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get . user interface: But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . industrial designer: That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: No , but incorporating the three  obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: and from user interface: Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . marketing: Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We'd also have to wor  consider that  who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna  learn about  labour laws . project manager: industrial designer: You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit  labour in  third world countries . industrial designer: So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're  par the reason the cost is high for the device is because  you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . project manager: Yeah , but we can get a production in , countries like , India industrial designer: Cost of living is low . project manager: yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . So industrial designer: Good , well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to  explore more project manager: Yeah , yeah , so Yes . project manager: So Yeah , so industrial designer: Yeah marketing: We're here to design , come up with a nice product . project manager: Yes  , but  that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . project manager: So we don't need to have our own  fabric factory or something , industrial designer: project manager: so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different  electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but  le let's decide first about the components concept and  interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what  Ed was talking . And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so user interface: I think it depends ,  I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you . user interface: So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . user interface:  it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for industrial designer:  . user interface: 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , project manager: user interface: but that's just sort of speculation ,  . industrial designer: What do you think Ed ? Do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , do you know how much it costs , to to add a little display like this  ? marketing: No . No industrial designer: Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? marketing: no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . industrial designer: So the the advanced chip on print is what  what we've we've deci we've determined marketing: industrial designer: and the  engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and  I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding  this concept of a wooden case . user interface: What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or industrial designer:  I don't think so , no , project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: so you have that tactile experience of project manager: Don't looks nice  . Yeah , so  what we'll do is , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until  th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . project manager: maybe what you can do is  , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: So  are we done with this meeting ? project manager: Yeah , I hope , if is it okay if  they will come up with the prototype design , okay . Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can  submit to the I will submit to the management . Okay ? Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for  the display . user interface: project manager: Of course you'll make money too , industrial designer: project manager: so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . user interface: marketing: user interface: marketing: project manager: Okay , so , any questions ? user interface: No . project manager: So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then  , then we can proceed from there . project manager: So thanks for all your  efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then "

        "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools? vaughan gething am: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales\u2014a child who's in critical care\u2014but that isn't confirmed. But the generals still apply\u2014that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area. sian gwenllian am: And in terms\u2014[Inaudible.] vaughan gething am: Chair. Sorry\u2014with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee. lynne neagle am: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Si\u00e2n could repeat her question? vaughan gething am: I can hear it, yes. lynne neagle am: Okay, Si\u00e2n, would you mind repeating that, please? sian gwenllian am: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus\u2014let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales\u2014do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children? vaughan gething am: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care\u2014. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. But the challenge in all of that this is\u2014it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped.\u00a0If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment\u2014you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day. lynne neagle am: [Inaudible.]\u2014Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: Hello. Right, we'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden. Minister, just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us. How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that? vaughan gething am: We've had to look at some specifics around communication, so challenges about not just different languages, but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment, and it's really challenging. We've had to think about the way it works, and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse. I understand people's fear and anxiety, but that then means that their family, and in particular their child, isn't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have. So, there's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through. That's actually about rebuilding people's confidence in the service, and that isn't straightforward because there's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating. But I think for us it's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service. We've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family, please discuss your concerns with them. There are times you need to be physically in the same place, for example on routine vaccinations, because we certainly haven't stopped that programme either, and I really wouldn't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we've done is that if parents don't engage with that service, we could potentially see a rise in other diseases. We're all, I think\u2014not just you\u00a0in your constituency, but others who are on this call and\u00a0others as well\u2014seeing an occasional reappearance of measles, and that's because people didn't engage with the vaccination programme. I don't want, either myself or a different health Minister in the future, to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in. So, I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations, but recently, through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families, that trend seems to have turned and there's now a much better attendance. One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations. So, yes, there was a bit of a downturn, but it does seem to be improving at the moment. We're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. sian gwenllian am: It's a cause of great concern to us all, of course, in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people. So, what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place? vaughan gething am: Again, I think it's helpful that you've already heard from the education Minister last week, because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children. So, children's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister. Part of the honest challenge, again, is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact. So, we're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference. Until we have more contact with families, we may not fully understand that, and that's a real point of concern for me. In all of the unknowns within this, the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them, because we're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health, how we support people, and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need, and then how we need to think about that. Obviously, it's a key factor for their return to school, but, actually, for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment, and that will be difficult because we're going to phase out of lockdown\u2014it's not going to be a one-hit measure. We're going to be looking at, at each point, what difference has been made, what more we can do. And, again, there are the efforts we're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services\u2014that we keep on reminding people that they're there and are available, and we want people to make use of them, because I know, as this committee said, we'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future. sian gwenllian am: So, in reality, there's been no assessment undertaken because it's difficult to do that. So, the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis\u2014you don't know what they are at the moment as things stand. vaughan gething am: We can't know, because we don't have that level of contact. I wouldn't say that no work's being done, but I couldn't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture. If I tried to say that, then I'm sure you'd ask me, 'How on earth can you say that? If you're not having regular contact with people, you can't possibly understand the picture.' And it's much better to say, 'We don't understand the full picture. We're working alongside health boards and others, but we'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families.' I'll look at a variety of different areas, again, both to reform the recovery plan, but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future, and the picture that we're seeing isn't straightforward and we need to make sure that we don't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we'd want to be. sian gwenllian am: But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister? vaughan gething am: Of course. Not just on the work we've done in the past; not just because it's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools, but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and to move forwards, that we don't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we haven't thought about what that will look like. In amongst all the other priorities I have, I'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten. sian gwenllian am: And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS, for example, in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus? vaughan gething am: No, we've actually got\u2014. Maybe perhaps it might be helpful, Chair, if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we're monitoring the impact we have, in terms of we've got a reporting tool, but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services. Yes, on that question, we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place, as the Minister said, a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards, so through that tool, we look at that every week in terms of collecting information. Whilst national reporting's been stood down, we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services, referral numbers and so on, so we do have that tool in place, and at the moment, that's telling us that the system can meet the capacity; has the capacity to meet need. sian gwenllian am: Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak? tracey breheny: There has been some movement, as I'm saying, around health boards, particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision, providing critical care, but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week, those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever, or from different parts of the system. sian gwenllian am: And then, what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients? Because that's what I'm hearing, that there has been such a reduction, but how are those patients then treated and served? tracey breheny: In terms of in-patient capacity, that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment. There were some discharges of young people, but we've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place. sian gwenllian am: And finally in this section from me, given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services, how can young people access appropriate services\u2014online services, for example? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment? vaughan gething am: Well, we've not closed off general practice and, as you know, we've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner. We've expanded a range of telephone advice services, so the telephone advice service we already provide, we've made sure that's maintained, and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions. I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas. That is, again, a worry for me, but the communications we have within the health and care system, people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available, and actually, as I say, we've expanded that right across our healthcare system. Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is, I don't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services. Of course, most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already. sian gwenllian am: But, of course, there will be some who are missed; they may fall between two stools because they won\u2019t know where to turn. vaughan gething am: Yes, and that, again, comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context, with their families, to know where support and advice and guidance is. Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they can't find advice somewhere else, so that's why there's the information we're providing through general practice to signpost people, so those pathways haven\u2019t been closed off. It's about making sure that people have alternative means that they\u2019re prepared to use at this point in time. If we go back to where we started this evidence session, we were talking about the difficulty of families who don't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home. So, there's a real challenge about how we make the service available, but then encourage people to take it up, so that we don\u2019t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point. I've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies, and can I remind Ministers about concise answers, please? Suzy. Just as we're speaking about children and young people's mental health, I wonder if you can confirm whether you've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people, and whether the operational guidance you've given out is responding to that in any way, or maybe there was something in that that you hadn\u2019t thought of and you can respond to as we go along. vaughan gething am: I, personally, haven't read that advice, but the Government's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions. You don't need to be a parent to recognise that that\u2019s a potential issue for children and young people. I haven't read it, but that's been signposted, so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we're already adopting, because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources, including the UN, the World Health Organization and others. But, as you know, Minister, the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart. Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic? vaughan gething am: Apart from the general concern that I've expressed on mental health generally, we are already investigating, we're having a\u2014. We've commissioned, through the Government, the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group, including Dr Ann John and other people, to review the current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. So, that's why we've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have, so we're able then to provide a report to understand where we are. My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and, obviously, I know the committee\u2019s got an interest, so if it's helpful we can write to you once we've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it. In terms of provision of crisis care, then, how has that been impacted by the pandemic? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment? vaughan gething am: Yes, they continue to be available. We've made clear that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time, and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health. Moving on to perinatal mental health, this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period, but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother, let alone in a pandemic. We've also been looking at how that's provided on a phone or online basis where possible, because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people. So, we're looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that we've made. And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frame\u2014that is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now. lynne neagle am: Is the Welsh Government aware that there's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision, and will you be taking that into account in your planning? Because, obviously, we wouldn't want people to think that was because of a lack of need; it's down to fear and the lockdown. vaughan gething am: Yes, we're aware there's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service\u2014or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase\u2014because we know that's the same with a range of other areas. There aren't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus. So, I certainly wouldn't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create. Obviously, we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and the\u2014there are two funds, aren't there, for third sector organisations? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people, and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the \u00a36.3 million for hospices is for children's hospices? I don't mind who answers that one. Certainly, I'm sure the committee is aware, as Suzy has said, of the funds that are available for third sector services. The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip, of course, announced on 6 April the \u00a324 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund, and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government. They can also benefit from the \u00a3400 million economic resilience fund, but I am aware that some groups don't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that. So, we've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA, such as the voluntary services emergency fund, which supports volunteering, and the third sector resilience fund, supporting organisations to stay afloat. We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services, care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises. Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers, and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines. And, actually, about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19. The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children's social services at the start of the lockdown period, but, since then, the numbers have actually risen. Meic, Action for Children, and, of course, Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package.",
        " In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children, I can't give you an actual figure for that, but, certainly, there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children. vaughan gething am: It's about \u00a31.5 million from the \u00a36.3 million that's gone to T\u0177 Gobaith and T\u0177 Hafan, Suzy. Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister, when she's in a position to do so, to let us have a note. Before we finish on this point, could I ask the Deputy Minister, again, about whether any of the things you've been talking about now is additional money, because, obviously, you mentioned yourself one of these funds is \u00a324 million. So, again, if you don't have the answer to hand, perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in. I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there, and the \u00a324 million is for support and extra help. dawn bowden am: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authorities\u2014you know, schools and health services\u2014to report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done. professor jean white: Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. dawn bowden am: Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. Do you think that needs revisiting at all? julie morgan am: The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care\u2014the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern? julie morgan am: Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating\u00a0risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks? julie morgan am: It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced \u00a33 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed? julie morgan am: Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it\u2019s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines? julie morgan am: We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care\u2014I mentioned them before\u2014have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now\u2014that they have contact with. janet finch-saunders am: So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please? julie morgan am: Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things\u2014have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister, I think, about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed, about which children's rights impact assessments have been done. Have any been done, and can they be shared with the committee if they have? Sorry, Deputy Minister\u2014my mistake. julie morgan am: Well, it's been a very difficult time, as you appreciate, in terms of having to make legislation very quickly, and it hasn't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do. And this is to try to get from children their views of what's happened, what we've been doing, and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation. So, we're doing this in conjunction with the children's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament. So, this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children, and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them, what they feel about what's happened during this period, what they feel about the way that we've dealt with the schools, the way that they've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long. So, I'm very pleased that we're doing that, but, in terms of an impact assessment, it has been very difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine, to be able to do those at these times. Just to say for the committee, really importantly, that we haven't introduced any easements in relation to children's services legislation. So, from a Welsh context, the standards that are in place do remain, so therefore there wouldn't have been a necessity for us to do a children's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation. I think that's particularly a strong point to us in Wales, both in terms of safeguarding arrangements, but also ensuring that children's rights are protected at a crucial time. In terms of childcare and education, we're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements, and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those. Obviously, the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments, but, in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\u2014and I think Albert was just saying the same thing\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward. Well, just to come back on that then, are you saying to me that, as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we've had, no assessments for children's needs have been postponed, cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person? julie morgan am: Well, I think, as Albert said, that there was no relaxation of regulation for children's social care. There's no relaxation, but what's happening in practice? We're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\u2014who's doing the children's needs assessments, particularly for young carers? julie morgan am: Well, I\u2014. Albert, can you answer that? albert heaney: I think the first thing to say to the committee is that, going back, we took a very strong line at the beginning that we weren't going to introduce easements in requirements to children's social services. Of course, through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate, they are having to operate through a different time. So, assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns; assessments are still taking place, and especially in relation to\u2014as you mentioned\u2014young carers, to support their needs. So, arrangements\u2014[Inaudible.] But they're having to be slightly differently done\u2014so, some of the technology, and keeping in contact and keeping those visits. So, we've used, for example, the St David's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well. So, we're having to be a little bit more\u2014and social services departments are having to be a little bit more\u2014innovative in the use of technology in the way that they've engaged as well. But personal visits are taking place, and visits especially, as the Minister mentioned earlier on\u2014they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits, to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time. I don't want to take this much further, but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic. Have they been accepted by Government, and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day, Deputy Minister? julie morgan am: Well, those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group. I've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues, and we are setting up this group, as you know, and we will be looking at those issues in the group. Any steal on when that might report? julie morgan am: I don't have that at the moment. Can I just say, we are running short of time? We did start late, so, if the Ministers are happy, we'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.\u20143.10 p.m.\u2014if that's okay. sian gwenllian am: [Inaudible.] lynne neagle am: Hold on a sec, Si\u00e2n, we've lost translation again. sian gwenllian am: You will know, Deputy Minister\u2014because we have discussed this in private session\u2014my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector, and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis, as families start to return to the workplace. There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and aren't receiving financial support. Do you agree\u2014are there people who are still not being supported, and why isn't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector? julie morgan am: Thank you, Si\u00e2n, for that question. Basically, we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops. So, that is guaranteed to them, and they are able to take advantage of the Government's job retainer scheme, but that does mean that there is a problem, as I think we've discussed before, of the double funding issue, and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this. I'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute, because she's much more up to date with the discussions about that, but, so far, I don't think very much progress has been made on that. But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector, and I'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip, who is responsible for the voluntary sector, because obviously many of the groups that we're talking about would come under the voluntary sector, because they have voluntary committees, but they fall between many stools, because they rent premises rather than own premises and they don't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants. So, some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme, but certainly not all of them; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund, and, as the Deputy Minister said, we're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding. All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government's coronavirus job retention scheme, but there are some complications around that in that it's a salary-based scheme and you can't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff. So, if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff's salary, you can't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well, and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances, which we're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that. Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings, but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can. We're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next, the recovery and the return of the sector, and we've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well. sian gwenllian am: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector? julie morgan am: Well, that is what we're looking to see\u2014if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Si\u00e2n, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this. sian gwenllian am: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers? julie morgan am: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so\u2014. , that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics. nicola edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them? julie morgan am: Yes, that would be very good. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way? julie morgan am: Well, that is the intention\u2014that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please. suzy davies am: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the\u2014well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that? julie morgan am: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really\u2014that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising. lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward"

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "lynne neagle am: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's Children, Young People and Education Committee. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees\u2014pupils who are eligible for free school meals. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to\u2014in challenge advisers' discussions in schools\u2014we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that, 'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.' Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school\u2014it's an ethos for the whole school\u2014but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible\u00a0for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that, then, has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals. So, growth mindset; it may be attachment disorder training for staff, for instance, where we know it's of benefit to everybody, but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students. With regard to more able and talented, you know, Llyr, that this is an area of concern for me, generally, within the Welsh education system; that we've not been particularly good at identifying, supporting and driving attainment for those children. I'm absolutely clear that PDG needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential, whatever the potential of that child is, including more able and talented. And again, I'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in Pembrokeshire: a window on the world bus, again paid for by schools. kirsty williams am: Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world. And, again, that's very much targeted at raising aspirations and giving children who are more able and talented, who are eligible for PDG, those experiences,\u00a0and to really push them. So, yes, I'm absolutely clear that PDG shouldn't just be seen to be getting individuals to the average. For those children who are more able and talented, it should be used to support them\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that\u00a0it is being used properly? kirsty williams am: I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions. llyr gruffydd am: So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target? kirsty williams am: Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that\u00a0we've got at present. Some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands, so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit, for instance, we've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need, going forward. We haven't had any additional resource as a result of this, but we're very mindful that, potentially, this has an impact, going forward. And, officials are working all of the time, I must say, in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that\u00a0there will be a full public consultation on that. Finally for now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that\u00a0group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering\u00a0whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work.\u00a0So, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6\u00a0concept, but as an 'Ever 2' concept. We have looked at Ever 6,\u00a0and I'm going to be absolutely blunt with you: to introduce an Ever 6\u00a0concept for Wales would mean in the region of identifying an additional \u00a340 million. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional \u00a340 million to introduce an Ever 6. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years. darren millar am: It's just a very brief point in response to the \u00a340 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG,\u00a0yes? So, if you reduced the level of PDG slightly, but made it available to more individuals, if you like, via allocating it in a different way, then that \u00a340 million price ticket wouldn't be there, would it? kirsty williams am: I was asked a question about had I ever\u00a0considered an Ever 6. We could, indeed, change the way in which we allocate PDG money, but we have to do it within the envelope that is available to me, over \u00a390 million. That's a significant level of investment, but, of course, as always, Darren, we could cut the amount per pupil, but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done\u2014because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say, 'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.'\u00a0Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying, 'We're\u00a0not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,'\u00a0because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say, 'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.' darren millar am: Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have? kirsty williams am: We've\u2014 ruth conway: Sorry\u2014I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition,\u00a0and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that 'the majority of schools are making\u00a0well thought out and appropriate decisions' on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds\u00a0of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding? kirsty williams am: Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it\u2014that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn\u00a0has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools\u00a0it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children, and to have a system in place. So we've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning. We're also seeing from Estyn that, actually, in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works, Estyn says that PDG is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money. But clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be, and again we come back to the decision I've made to appoint regional PDG advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach. We are, in the discussions that I have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage, looking for very clear evidence of schools using the Sutton Trust toolkit, and we could have a discussion about whether that's the right thing, because that's on my mind too. But we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base, and if they're not, if a school isn't doing that, okay, so demonstrate to us why you've made those decisions and, crucially, what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils. So, if you're moving away from tried and tested interventions, what we know works, if you're doing something different with your money, okay, you need to justify that and you need to explain how you're going to demonstrate impact. But I think what we're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the PDG develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops. llyr gruffydd am: You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding. kirsty williams am: No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been\u2014well, I suppose it is\u00a0the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools. llyr gruffydd am: So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on. kirsty williams am: As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that. mark reckless am: Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals? kirsty williams am: I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance,\u00a0but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said, 'We recognised we had a problem with attendance. We tried a variety of means of improving that, but in the end we have taken this quite bold step\u2014we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus, and they walk the children into school'. They say that they know that, for some of those children, because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in, they probably wouldn't be in school if it wasn't for that proactive approach. So, we're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance, because although, again, there are examples of good practice, there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils. And, of course, we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching, but unless the children are in the classes then we're not going to make the difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children. mark reckless am: I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative. kirsty williams am: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. steve davies: There is also another very good example\u2014and I take what you say about where there are small numbers\u2014but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals? kirsty williams am: So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think\u00a0what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency approach to supporting that particular child. Some of those exclusions can be as a result of the need to address other issues going on in a child's life. So, this is where we come back to the committee's work, for instance, on mental health and support for children, support for behaviour in school. So, again, it's a multi-agency approach that I think we need, and, in our good schools, our really, really good schools, there's a recognition of that need to have a whole team around a child to support that child in education. So, for those children who do find themselves in education other than at school, we are providing additional support that previously was not available. hefin david am: It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. So, if you look at it\u2014with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer\u2014on the face of it, the gap has increased. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus\u2014one in five\u2014by 2016, we had got that down to one in three. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but, Sir Alasdair, who knows about these things, says that that is a significant improvement.\u00a0Last year, we got some challenges. We need to understand why that happened, but I do think it's\u2014 hefin david am: Why, do you think? kirsty williams am: Why, do I think?\u00a0What I do think is there is no one answer. I think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from BTEC to science GCSEs. I think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who weren't doing a single science GCSE and are now doing science GCSEs. Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy\u00a0in all its forms that I think\u00a0could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject. hefin david am: So, to what extent would exam\u00a0boards be responsible for lack of grade stability? kirsty williams am: It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children. hefin david am: Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns? kirsty williams am: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again,\u00a0Hefin,\u00a0what we've got to be clear on is\u2014while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic\u2014we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city\u2014so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium\u2014you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents.",
        " For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years' time, when we will be looking back in two years' time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way? kirsty williams am: Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure anyway because of the\u2014 hefin david am: So, what performance measures will you use? kirsty williams am: So, for the lack of sophistication around the level 2 plus, and for the unintended behaviours that that particular performance measure has driven within our schools. What's important to me is that we have a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. What level 2 plus does is narrow, very much, the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort, usually the C/D borderline, which is why then we have problems with the number of students getting a B grade or above. Well, if a child gets a C but came to you in year 7 and they were destined to get an E, yes, indeed, a C is a success, because you've moved that child on; but, if that child came to you destined to get an A* and gets a C, then we haven't done a good job by that particular child. So, we need a performance measure that is much more sophisticated, looks at each individual child, tracks that progress, and measures the value added by that school in performance. hefin david am: Last question: therefore, should we have confidence in the data up to 2016? Is there a lack of confidence in that data? kirsty williams am: No, it's not a lack of confidence in the data. What I'm saying is, using that as a performance measure and an accountability measure within our school system may have been right for the time. I think that particular set of performance measures has driven certain behaviours\u2014not because Ministers wanted that to happen, but as an unintended consequence. I think we can work together with our school system, learning the lessons of international best practice, to develop much more sophisticated accountability and performance measures for individual schools, and, I should say, for the Government. So, you will be aware of my intention to issue the first national report card on Government performance later on this year. It's about trying to develop a more sophisticated way, which is in line with our national mission, where every child's education is valued, and where the impact of the school can be tracked more effectively. Can I just ask, Cabinet Secretary, are you still holding on to your target of 37 per cent of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold? kirsty williams am: Well, we're moving away from the level 2 threshold. So, we will want to develop a new suite, in line with our new accountability\u00a0measures, as we go forward.\u00a0So, we will be absolutely continuing to track and evaluate the performance of free-school-meal pupils. When we announce our new accountability measures, I will be in a position to address how we'll measure\u00a0the Government's\u00a0performance, and national performance, going forward. But, given the fact that we're moving\u00a0away from level 2 plus, then we will need a different set of performance\u00a0indicators. The next questions are on looked-after children and adopted children, and I've got questions from Michelle then Mark. mark reckless am: I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children\u00a0doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility\u00a0as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey\u2014only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary\u00a0schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder\u2014can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia\u00a0in this field? kirsty williams am: Okay. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. My understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment\u00a0of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it\u00a0was being used previously. We have looked-after children PDG co-ordinators\u2014they're in their second year this year\u2014to look at a regional deployment of that resource. And that resource can be done in a variety of ways, through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child, through to capacity building\u00a0for the whole system. So, for instance, if I give you an example, in Carmarthenshire, there's been a big emphasis on attachment\u00a0disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder. Carmarthenshire happens\u00a0to be one of those local authorities\u00a0that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children. But I have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year. Steve, on my behalf, wrote out to the system, setting out our expectations, but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money. So, what has that money\u00a0been used on and how can you account for the effect? But, Steve, maybe you can give some greater detail. One of the rationales\u00a0for shifting\u2014not that all the money stays in the region, but having a regional strategic\u00a0support\u2014was that, historically, the money was going directly\u00a0with that child to the school. Given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools\u2014the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents\u2014historically, what happened, the money lands in the school, because, at that time in the year, when it's measured, the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff, but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money\u00a0doesn't transfer. Some schools will go through quite a number of years without having\u00a0a looked-after child and will not think strategically, 'How do I need to support them?' So, that was the rationale of the shift. In terms\u00a0of the implementation of the regional allocation, as of this financial year finishing, we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they've located the resource, what the impact of that resource has been, so that is reinforced\u00a0and shared more widely. kirsty williams am: And then, to reassure, it's not just internally that we're looking at this. We have a contract with an external agency to do an evaluation\u2014 mark reckless am: That's ICF consulting. Yes, so that was done in the autumn of last year, because, as I said, we had concerns about whether this was really having the effect that was intended. So, my expectation is that we will be in a position to receive that report later on this spring, and of course it would be my intention that that report would be made public for people to have a look at what\u2014 mark reckless am: That was commissioned last autumn\u2014 kirsty williams am: Yes, in November 2017. kirsty williams am: So, I'm hoping to have that published before the summer recess. I'm very reluctant to say months; I've learnt not to say months, because they move. lynne neagle am: I'm going to go to Michelle now, Mark, because\u2014 mark reckless am: Sure. lynne neagle am: \u2014both of you asked for these questions, and that's what the pre-meeting is for. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date? kirsty williams am: As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of, 'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family, 'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.' lynne neagle am: Michelle. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners in general. What are your views on that approach? kirsty williams am: I'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners, we'll be getting it right for all of our learners. I gave the example earlier, for instance, of attachment disorder, and, Chair, you will know that I have had conversations. One of the emerging themes for me, as I go around visiting schools, is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder, and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children. So, for instance, as I said about Carmarthenshire, there's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in Carmarthenshire. Now, that has a disproportionate benefit for those children, because you're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced, because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived, but that doesn't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after. So, that vulnerable learner, regardless of their background, will benefit from having teachers who are better trained, understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need. steve davies: I think it's also important to add that this is not one region's approach; this is across four regions, so the others\u2014. For example, ERW have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils, which has\u00a0enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies. kirsty williams am: I was in Pil\u00a0Primary School recently where they use their PDG, both FSM PDG, and no doubt an element of PDG for\u00a0looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a\u00a0better position to learn. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data.\u00a0Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who\u00a0were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so? kirsty williams am: We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support\u2014even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas\u2014. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying, 'Actually,\u00a0this will mean more money for your child's school budget'\u00a0is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying, 'Actually, it's going to help you',\u00a0because they don't want to be seen being dependent, they don't want to be seen being helped.\u00a0But, if you say to them, 'Actually,\u00a0do you know that this means more money for your child's school?', they go, 'Oh, all right then, I'll fill in the forms now.'\u00a0So, you're right, I think there is something that we could do to make parents understand, in the round, that this has an impact. But we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing. One of the things I am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can, across Government, work more closely together. We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone.\u00a0And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement,\u00a0where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school\u2014when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think, 'Oh\u00a0my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?'\u00a0If you can imagine, the school could have been working really, really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place, to get them being able to access the curriculum, and then social services decide that the placement is being changed. So, a greater involvement in education\u00a0and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this. If we think we can crack this with just PDG, then we're being delusional. It has to be a cross-government approach at a national level, and at a local government level as well, to get this right. Sometimes, data protection\u2014how can we break down some of these barriers between, you know, the school doesn't need to, schools shouldn't see, the entire social services report? Well, maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they're going to have an impact for that child.\u00a0So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children. julie morgan am: Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. kirsty williams am: Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again\u2014and I've said this a lot\u2014after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. Can you expand on that and what effect the PDG has had in this result, or not had? kirsty williams am: Well,\u00a0there's no getting away from it: the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children, the results are not good enough. That's why officials are engaging with the group that David Melding is chairing, to make sure that education is integral to that group and it's not lost sight of. There's a discussion to be had about the cohort, whether it's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort, or whether these statistics are useful in any way. Sometimes as well\u2014this is not to make an excuse because, as I've said in my paper, it's extremely disappointing, but sometimes it can be really difficult. Because the cohort sometimes can be very, very small, it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic. julie morgan am: I think, generally, when you look at how looked-after children do\u2014 kirsty williams am: It's not good. julie morgan am: \u2014in\u00a0a much wider evaluation, they're not doing well, are they? kirsty williams am: They're not doing well. So, that's why we've got the review, the independent review, into the impact of the PDG in this area. This is why Steve is doing the work that he is doing with the regional consortia because, clearly, at the moment, we are not doing what we need to do for that particular cohort of children. steve davies: I think we will not move away from the fact that these children need good GCSEs to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and\u00a0still hold on to the fact\u00a0that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions? kirsty williams am: We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that\u00a0our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission\u2014to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school. I was just wondering what your assessment\u00a0is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't. kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. I think, talking to those involved\u00a0in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because\u2014 kirsty williams am: Leadership is all. I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage. llyr gruffydd am: The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda? kirsty williams am: Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia.\u00a0It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school?\u00a0We're looking at the teacher quality\u2014how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity\u2014again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools.",
        " So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools\u2014but that expertise is available to all our schools. llyr gruffydd am: Although Estyn\u00a0has told us, of course, that you can't expect the consortia to\u00a0really carry on with that level of intervention and the same kind of intensity as was provided previously, so I'm just wondering\u2014 kirsty williams am: In what way? llyr gruffydd am: Well, we were told by Estyn\u00a0in evidence that they didn't necessarily think that we could expect the consortia to provide the same type of tailored support, and certainly the level of intensity with the improvement boards and everything\u2014 kirsty williams am: Well, the improvement boards are carrying on, so the improvement boards still exist, and I would\u2014not that I want to argue with Estyn\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Well, feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you\u2014 kirsty williams am: What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme,\u00a0which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr,\u00a0in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements. llyr gruffydd am: So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back. kirsty williams am: Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again\u2014gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down, but what we have seen is investment via Schools Challenge Cymru,\u00a0but ongoing, continual support from the regional consortium, and that school has come out of special measures. I pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job. So, I'm absolutely convinced that where we've got good\u00a0leadership and good support,\u00a0some of those schools are making continued, sustained progress even after the end of the programme. The challenge for me is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and we haven't seen that progress\u2014how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference. So that's what my focus is on now: a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support, when we recognise that there are schools everywhere, potentially, that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of\u2014well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have. kirsty williams am: What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over \u00a310 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work. llyr gruffydd am: So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department? kirsty williams am: Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that. llyr gruffydd am: Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had? kirsty williams am: Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about\u2014Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon\u2014I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take\u2014. I always take the opportunity to speak to those teachers about their experience of the programme and to understand and assure myself that they are getting ongoing support that they see as an appropriate level for them. hefin david am: With regard to it being a time-limited programme, the previous Minister was clear that it was a time-limited programme, but it wasn't quite as time-limited as you've decided to be. Is that fair to say? kirsty williams am: No, it was supposed to be a three-year programme at the most. So, there's no differential between when I decided it was time-limited and the expectations\u2014 hefin david am: So the time limit was the same that the previous Minister put on it. llyr gruffydd am: But Mel Ainscow did tell us that there was a fade out in that third year\u2014not that people were giving up, don't get me wrong, but clearly there wasn't that commitment coming from Government because the decision had been made, and people felt that it was just fizzling out a little bit, and that impacted on the momentum. I think there certainly was a transition phase when we knew that the programme was moving and schools were moving into a different level of support,\u00a0but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fading out\u2014not at all. As I said, we were aware that the programme was transitioning and we were determined to get that right for those individual schools, and to learn the lessons and, crucially, to be able to apply those lessons right across the board. steve davies: I can see where the perception would come if a programme director like Mel was managing the programme right to the end of the three years exactly the same, and it falls off\u2014not a cliff, but it falls off, then the readiness for schools and the readiness in the system to hand over\u2014so part of the shift of focus was that working as a Government with the programme in those schools to working with the programme, those schools and the region. So, I think, inevitably, one party might see it as a decrease in terms of emphasis on their work, but it was necessary for the transition. llyr gruffydd am: But does that cast a bit of a shadow over the transition, then\u2014that one key player within that process felt as such, or are you confident that that was managed well and effectively? kirsty williams am: I think it was managed well, and we were very clear to recognise success where success has been achieved, but not to gloss over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference\u00a0and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us. lynne neagle am: Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia? kirsty williams am: Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know. kirsty williams am: And can I just say, I met with some of them? I met with a selection of those people who had been involved in the programme to get their feedback on what they felt had gone right, and what they didn't feel had gone right in the programme. So, I took the time not just to meet the figurehead\u00a0of the programme, but actually to meet the people who were doing the work in the individual schools. darren millar am: Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the figurehead there, I assume by 'the figurehead' you mean Professor Ainscow. And you've mentioned as well that you said you wanted to learn lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru, but he told us that nobody had been in touch with him since March of last year in order to have any sort of follow-up engagement, or to have a dialogue about his perspective on what worked, what didn't work, why there were failures in some areas and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme? kirsty williams am: I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. darren millar am: But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow\u2014with Professor Ainscow himself. steve davies: I would actually say that I have had meetings\u2014 darren millar am: Since March of last year. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and discussions. darren millar am: So, when he told us, 'Since last March, I literally have had no contact at all with anybody from Welsh Government', he was telling porky pies, was he? steve davies: That's not my recollection. kirsty williams am: Yes, well, I just talked about the celebration event to formally mark the end of the programme. And this idea that somebody has been ignored or frozen out is not how I see or how I regard that situation. mark reckless am: I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia.\u00a0I just wonder,\u00a0Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area. kirsty williams am: Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual. kirsty williams am: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him,\u00a0Owen Evans\u00a0has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you\u2014and I'm absolutely confident\u2014is that we\u00a0have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia\u2014. mark reckless am: I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him\u00a0individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a\u00a0desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers\u00a0being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about?\u00a0Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government to help in this area. kirsty williams am: Firstly, can I say that I have never described the programme as a failure? I would understand, as someone who has put so much personal investment into the brand of schools challenges, that he would not want anybody to characterise that particular approach to school improvement as a failure. And I want to be absolutely clear that I have never described the programme as a failure, and I want to reassure Mr Ainscow of that. As I've said, gosh, my goodness me, if you saw my e-mail inbox and you saw the letters that come in, people are never shy\u00a0in coming forward to give me advice on what I need to do, what I need to do next, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and, you know, our doors are always open to listen to people who have interesting things to say about how we can deliver our educational mission. I'm sure the Minister is aware that Cardiff put extra funds of its own in to continue Schools Challenge Cymru advisers. So, obviously, they appreciated the value of the scheme, but it does query whether it should have gone on longer. kirsty williams am: Julie, I think, to be fair, there are some people who think the scheme was absolutely fantastic. I've had feedback from people who didn't think the scheme was helpful at all\u2014in fact, they felt it was a hindrance. I'm very much of the view that the scheme worked really well for some schools in some areas and had less impact\u00a0in some areas. What's important to me is that we understand what it was that led those schools to make those big changes, how we can\u2014like Mark talked about,\u00a0the expertise\u2014how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply\u00a0the lessons to all schools. john griffiths am: Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. john griffiths am: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual\u00a0school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region? kirsty williams am: I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there could sometimes be tensions between the two, but in most cases, the relationship was very, very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers. But I'm going to be blunt and honest with people\u2014in some cases, it has been reported to me\u2014it's only anecdotal evidence; I haven't got hard and fast evidence\u2014that there sometimes was a conflict: 'We're a school challenge school so we don't need to participate or listen to any advice that's coming from the regional consortia.' Or, a local education authority said to me, 'We felt that we couldn't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme.' Those were isolated incidents, and, as I said, it's only anecdotal feedback. steve davies: Just very quickly, I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting\u2014[Inaudible.]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them\u2014and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this\u2014it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions\u2014I can't remember which ones\u2014so he's established relationships\u2014[Interruption.] Sorry? kirsty williams am: Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working. kirsty williams am: Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes\u2014for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent\u00a0monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members\u2014you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG\u2014because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record\u2014can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken? kirsty williams am: Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance, absolutely crucial? That's the bedrock. We don't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school. There are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this, but we are absolutely clear, and best practice and evidence shows us, that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial. And, as I said in the beginning, where we weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. Again, one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt, was, again, the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. lynne neagle am: Okay, and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, updating us on the supply teacher issue. Paper to note 3\u2014another letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, providing further information following our meeting on 15 February. And paper to note 6 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales, following up on the dialogue that they've been having about our inquiry. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting"

        "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

        "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .

For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much .

Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Then  I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you  a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by  our two colleagues that make good work . industrial designer: marketing: project manager: And  then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . And  end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . project manager: d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say  to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped  case with  a rubber material around it industrial designer: project manager: to be  to feel spongy , user interface: Like a banana . project manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can  we can continue with this product  as if , marketing: project manager: and we are now going to see the project evaluation with  our marketing expert . marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about  during the previous  meetings . marketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , project manager: Yeah . marketing: and  according to what you think about the this project you can   make a one point , two point or seven point . marketing: The okay ?  so  fancy look and feel , what do you think ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Do you vote  Christine ? marketing: eh ? user interface: Do you also vote ? marketing: No , I just want to see something project manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common user interface: Well , we can very easily . So user interface: marketing: Need to project manager: this is your marketing:  I don't know if you we ha we have to put  one  f If it's better or project manager: One is most . project manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? marketing: Six  s you can how much what ? project manager: How much would you you don't answer to this  questionnaire ? marketing: Oh yes I  I dunno  , I think six , it's a good  user interface: So it will have five point five average . project manager: Four ? industrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . I I user interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? project manager: No . project manager: Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? marketing: We can put four ? user interface: Yeah . Is it fashion ? project manager: Oh yeah , user interface: project manager: its its f its fruit fruit shape . marketing: Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , user interface: Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . marketing: We have the lightning , or project manager: Yeah , we have the marketing: The lighting . project manager: we don't sesh especially have the lightning user interface: So you'll make the material transparent project manager: but marketing: user interface: so that it  lights up completely , or project manager: So it's yellow . project manager: I think it's very easy to marketing: Seven ? project manager: I would say seven . marketing: Is it is it robust ? project manager: Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , industrial designer:  f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . user interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , project manager: Yeah . user interface: I don't know project manager: But it is  it is surrounded by rubber material .  if we say that seven it's  it's the better , project manager: Yeah , the be . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , the top marketing: and when  s six sit six are good it's a good  p product , I think . user interface: Because I saw  some phones that were banana shaped ,  wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , marketing: project manager: Yeah . user interface:  quite big also , marketing: user interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . project manager: I think the industrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . user interface: it's much more complex , but project manager: So , I think , we can summarise . We we have the cost below  our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . marketing: project manager: So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now  open champagne and make a huge party . user interface: project manager: I don't know if it's provided by  by the meeting staff . user interface: So what does the management say ? project manager: Sorry ? user interface: What does the management say ? project manager: I think we will have  much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well "

        " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call this meeting to order. Welcome to the 20thmeeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a reminder to all members, in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not be connected to the video conference. I want to remind those who are participating by video conference that, when they talk, they must use the channel that corresponds to the language they are speaking in. Chair, today I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2019 annual report on the RCMPs use of the law enforcement justification provisions. This report addresses the RCMP's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime, which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the Criminal Code. Chair, pursuant to Standing Order 32, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 2018-19 progress report on Canada's national action plan for the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during the meeting of a special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. Members who are participating in the meeting in person are kindly asked to bring the signed certificate to the office once the petition has been presented. The petitioners note that research from around the world points to a threat to pollinators, particularly from a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids. The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to practise a precautionary principle and remove from use neonicotinoids in Canada to protect our pollinators. These iconic whales are much beloved in SaanichGulf Islands, throughout coastal British Columbia and indeed across Canada. The petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline, more action for boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance, and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct. Chair, for over 10 years, members of Parliament from various parties have been trying to pass legislation to deal with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. Irwin Cotler, Borys Wrzesnewskyj, Senator Salma Ataullahjan and I have all proposed bills on this. This is another bill that would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. I'm sure petitioners would want me to add that, given the urgency of this issue, perhaps the government could consider bringing forward a government bill on this issue, which would allow the process to move much faster. Chair, I rise here today to present a petition from Canadian citizens in support of motion M-1, which was placed in this House by my colleague the member for New WestminsterBurnaby on the green new deal. These citizens point out that climate change has escalated into a global climate emergency and that Canada must act with ambition and urgency. They call on the government to support M-1, a made in Canada green new deal, to take bold and rapid action to adopt socially equitable climate action to tackle the climate emergency and address worsening socio-economic and racial inequalities at the same time while ending fossil fuel subsidies, closing offshore tax havens, and supporting workers impacted by the transition by creating well-paying, unionized jobs in the shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. Chair, it's an honour and privilege to table e-petition 2577, which was sponsored by Chris Alemany from Port Alberni and is supported by 5,183 petitioners. They're calling on the Government of Canada to work urgently across party lines and in partnership with provincial and territorial governments to implement a guaranteed, consistent, national and livable universal basic income system for all Canadians. The petition is very timely, coming almost one year to the day since the completion of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which also called on the government to establish a guaranteed annual livable income for all Canadians. Whether it's about providing a safety net to get through a global pandemic, the means to keep your children out of poverty at any time, or simply being able to afford safe housing or transportation, it's time for Canada to have this conversation. Chair, it's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of NanaimoLadysmith. People are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change. They're calling on the government to commit to upholding the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the Coastal GasLink project on the Wet'suwet'en territory, and by ordering the RCMP to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down. They also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we're happy to see has been happening and I commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Chair, like Canada, Guyana is part of the Commonwealth, and many constituents of Winnipeg North have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in March, when it was being called into question. There have been some very positive indications in recent days, but the petitioners are asking the Government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to be aware of what's taking place in Guyana, and as much as possible, to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we're being diligent in supporting what the people of Guyana want to see. the chair: I just want to remind the honourable members, when presenting petitions, to be as concise as possible. I notice they're starting to stretch a bit and it's something we all tend to do. Chair, I just want to say thank you to the industrious people of Sudbury who have risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of COVID-19. I am proud of all my constituents, and all Canadians, including first responders, volunteers, health care and essential workers, local miners, the farmers and produce growers who are feeding our families, and local businesses who are staying connected with their staff. I also salute all our homegrown innovations such as ProStitch and King Sportswear face masks; Crosscut Distillery hand sanitizer; Nobel Prize winner SNOLAB's work on ventilators, which earned a federal contract; Vale Canada's $1 million in seed capital to small firms developing COVID-19 health solutions; and many more. It's tucked in between the Fraser and Pitt rivers and is in the shadow of Golden Ears mountain. In the 1900s Dutch immigrants drained and diked the marshes allowing for today's bumper crops of cranberries and blueberries. It's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to Vancouver and has one of the nation's busiest general aviation airports. In a great show of community spirit, from their front yards and balconies, thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city. I am thankful to have raised my family here, taught in the schools and to now be the member of Parliament representing this wonderful community. Chair, over the last few months I have watched constituents in my riding come together to look out for one another during these challenging times. Regardless of how deep and painful this pandemic has been, it continues to amaze me just how brightly the collective character of Cape BretonCanso shines through. Whether it is someone like Glen Muise, who delivers iPads to seniors' homes so they can connect with loved ones, teachers who deliver meals to students in need, Liam and Lucus Sakalauskas, two young boys who keep youth informed across the east coast, or Rose Fitzgerald, who delivered bouquets made from the remaining flowers from her shop to essential workers across her county, constituents in Cape BretonCanso have stepped up to support their community and to support those in need. Chair, as you know it is with great pride that I represent my constituents in Cape BretonCanso. They know that as a community, we're only as strong as our most vulnerable people, and I cannot help but be filled with joy when I see these gestures happening across my riding. sylvie brub (abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou, bq): Mr.Chair, unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member Romeo Saganash, whose commitment I commend, to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the Viens commission in Quebec. The Bloc is open to the idea, but we shouldn't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action. Last year alone, the Viens report and the report stemming from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contained dozens of recommendations. The federal government must work with indigenous peoples, Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces. Hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation. steven mackinnon (gatineau, lib.): Mr.Chair, on behalf of myself and my parliamentary colleagues, I want to congratulate students from our high school class of 2020. We know that, owing to the pandemic, graduation celebrations will be different this year, as students will be deprived of their prom, their graduation ceremony and, in some cases, their goodbyes to friends and teachers. I know how disappointed students from the high schools of duVersant, LeCarrefour, Nicolas-Gatineau, de l'rablire, Collge Saint-Alexandre, Collge Nouvelles Frontires, Collge Saint-Joseph, Philemon-Wright and other regional schools, are not to be able to celebrate their five years of incredible efforts surrounded by their families and friends who were by their side on a daily basis. So when they receive their diploma, here is what I will say to them: Surge ahead! The future belongs to you. Be ambitious, follow your dreams and, most importantly, continue to change the Outaouais and the world! The class of 2020 will be remembered for a long time. Chair, I am delighted to rise to talk about the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, which is now under construction in my riding in Winnipeg. This state-of-the-art addictions recovery facility was made into a reality by Scott, Anne and Darcy Oake in memory of their son and brother Bruce, who passed away tragically from an accidental overdose in 2011. The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre will provide help to thousands of Manitobans to manage their addiction and reintegrate into the community. With approximately eight million Canadians suffering from addictions, we need centres like these to help them recover so that no other family will face a heartbreaking loss due to addiction. Week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty. I want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services. I would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which, upon receiving these donations, redoubled their efforts to serve their communities. Special thanks go to the Mon Sheong Foundation Long-Term Care Centre, Divine Favour Senior Homecare, the Community & Home Assistance to Seniors, the True Compassion Home Health centre, Blue Door, the Mosaic Interfaith Out of the Cold program, Yellow Brick House, Hill House Hospice, Community Living York South, and Parya Trillium Foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of Richmond Hill. marie-france lalonde (orlans, lib.): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Usually, at this time of the year, I have the pleasure of being invited to the graduation ceremony of the grade12 students in Orlans. I cannot express enough how, in these exceptional times, I have witnessed the strength, resilience and community spirit of our graduates. I also know that a number of high schools have made significant efforts to celebrate the success of their graduating class. Young graduate Maryanne Collard was amazed to see that people from her school, the cole secondaire catholique Batrice-Desloges, had installed a sign in her garden to congratulate her on her academic success. The sad reality is that even before the crisis hit, most rural Canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable Internet connection, even though Internet is an essential service. Those in underserved areas, including many parts of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, cannot work from home and their children cannot keep up with their classmates. For many of my indigenous constituents, Internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies don't want to serve them. We call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address Internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban Canada. Congratulations go to Lutsl K' Dene First Nation and the Northwest Territory Mtis Nation, with support from Deninu K'ue First Nation and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, for the establishment of the Thaidene Nn territorial protected area. It's 14,000 square kilometres of the most beautiful land and waters you'll find anywhere on earth. I would also like to thank the previous minister of the environment for securing Canada's $7.9-million commitment, along with our visit to celebrate the new park last year. The award is given to groups that have exemplified actions to protect critical ecosystems and biodiversity for generations to come and to show how indigenous peoples and local communities have confronted legacies of disadvantage and discrimination in support of their communities and the world at large. Chair, the Liberal government has tabled $87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study, debate and pass it. They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament. It is Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who will have the responsibility to pay for this government's spending. It is real Canadians who fall through the cracks when this Liberal government's programs fail to meet their intended goals. Just as we gather four days a week for a hybrid committee meeting, parliamentarians can gather to do the full scope of the work that Canadians elected us to do. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. I want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things. Chair, today I rise to honour Justice 4 Black Lives Winnipeg, led by women and non-binary individuals, who stood together and mobilized our city to state clearly that we will not stand by and stay silent in the face of police brutality. We will not stand by while we witness our bodies being abused by centuries of racism supported through legislation that has left us vulnerable at the hands of those who abuse their power. We will join together to ensure that laws are instituted that are designed to protect us, not abuse us. To all the women and non-binary folks who are standing, I say, let's continue to sound our voices in solidarity and support of one another until indigenous and black lives are honoured and respected. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, this is not the time for governments to get complacent about COVID-19. First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic. Chair, I rise to give thanks and recognition to the contributions of many businesses and organizations across my riding of Edmonton Mill Woods that have stepped up in a major way during this pandemic. I joined my friends in the Filipino community who partnered with Mill Woods' Calvary Community Church to deliver care packages to seniors. Varinder Bhullar and his Green Scholars of Alberta team and Dil-E-Punjab restaurant provided thousands of free meals. Edmonton Towing and its full team with Dukh Nivaran Gudwara prepared food packages for any truckers who were coming through Edmonton. The staff, nurses and doctors of Grey Nuns Community Hospital in the heart of Mill Woods have been keeping people safe and healthy. I want to thank our Mill Woods community as a whole for its continued strength, resilience and compassion as we move forward together. This year is a difficult one, though, for all of us, including our Portuguese diaspora community across the globe that is deeply affected by the COVID situation. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our luso community of over half a million members in Canada from coast to coast for staying strong during these difficult times. Your warmth, hard work and team spirit resonate well across my riding of Mississauga EastCooksville and globally. As a Portuguese immigrant who came to Canada at the age of two with my family, I know this year will be a lot different from previous years. I encourage all of you to stay safe and enjoy a Portuguese meal, and please continue to support our local businesses. Please note that we will suspend the proceedings twice in order to allow employees who provide support for sitting to substitute each other very safely. He is refusing to table a budget, refusing to provide an economic update and refusing to let the House of Commons do its work. Will he at least provide the Auditor General with the additional funding she needs to look into government expenditures? right hon. justin trudeau (prime minister): Mr.Chair, not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help Canadians with the Canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities, but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that. Under the government, the Auditor General has had to do more with less, and her ability to conduct audits is being affected. The Auditor General has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits, despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending. Will the Prime Minister give the Auditor General the money she needs to do her job, yes or no? right hon. Chair, we worked with the Auditor General to increase the funding of the Auditor General's office in 2018-19, and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added. We support the Auditor General, unlike the Conservative government, which fired 60 people from the Auditor General's office. We are now proposing that we sit down to debate legislation this afternoon, and I certainly hope that members opposite will vote for debate. He well knows that it was the Auditor General's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies, which did not affect its ability to do the job. In fact, as the interim auditor general, John Wiersema, said, We would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for Parliament. Only the government's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the Auditor General's ability to give Canadians the answers they deserve, and we wonder why. This is the government that cannot explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone. Then there is, of course, the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank, which has completed precisely zero projects. Are these the reasons the Prime Minister is so intent on withholding funds from the Auditor General? right hon. Chair, talking of revisionist history, Stephen Harper's Conservatives cut $6.5 million from the Auditor General's budget and fired 60 staff. On the contrary, we worked with the Auditor General's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff. We will continue to respect the officers of Parliament, whom the Conservatives, in their time in office, showed no respect for. We will continue to move forward in a way that has led, for example, to proposing debate and voting on important legislation this afternoon to help Canadians. Chair, it's no surprise that the Prime Minister likes to reach back into history from before the 2015 election to justify his position. The 2015 election was the only time he got more votes than the Conservative Party did, so I understand why he likes to live in the past. In May, the interim auditor general said, Ten years ago, we were completing about 27 performance audits every year. The Auditor General's office has requested more funds to be able to do the job that Canadians expect to be done. Will the Prime Minister give those additional funds to the Auditor General's office, yes or no? right hon. Chair, we very much look forward to working with the new Auditor General to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions. Speaking of what is foundational to our institutions, this afternoon we're putting forward a bill that would help Canadians across the country, and we've proposed to debate and vote on that bill. They have been complaining about not having debates and votes in Parliament, and now they're proposing not to have them. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. This morning, we heard many groups and organizations that represent people with a disability express their concerns over the bill introduced by the government, which I feel is chocolate pudding containing cod liver oil. I am saying to the Prime Minister that, if he presents the part on disabled individuals, it will be passed at the speed of light. Is he prepared to divide the bill, so that we can work together to help people with a disability? right hon. We will also increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks. I am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ensure that we adopt these measures, all or some of the measures. That means that we are not adopting them all at the same time and that the bill is being split. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he is in fact going to split his bill so that we can address the various components separately, since they have nothing to do with each other, and improve them, in keeping with our mandate as elected officials? right hon. justin trudeau: Our goal on this side of the House, and it is shared by all members of the House, is to help Canadians during the pandemic. Yes, that includes Canadians living with disabilities, but it also includes businesses that cannot, but should be able to, access the wage subsidy. yves-franois blanchet: We almost had some clarity, but one swallow does not make a summer. The government says that it wants to transform the program into something very coercive, without admitting that the lack of an employment incentive has essentially sabotaged another program, the wage subsidy. When the government says that we are going to have to vote on this, it means rubber stamping its bill. justin trudeau: We are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon, we are proposing to debate it. It is the role and responsibility of all of us in the House to exchange ideas and to work together to help Canadians. It is about helping people with disabilities, increasing the flexibility of the CERB, and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it. I would be remiss if I allowed the Prime Minister to mislead people quite unintentionallyI say this in accordance with the Standing Orders. When we introduce a bill, we discuss it at second reading, we vote, we continue to discuss it and we send it to committee. Can we follow the real procedures of Parliament, do a proper job, and then have a vote that is likely to suit the majority of members, not just the Prime Minister? right hon. We have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill, if they had amendments to propose. That is how we are taking action to help Canadians quickly during this crisis, and that is what we will continue to do. jagmeet singh (burnaby south, ndp): Mr.Chair, will the Prime Minister make a clear and direct commitment today to extend the CERB for families who need it? right hon. justin trudeau: Mr.Chair, we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help Canadians living with disabilities, will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit. jagmeet singh: Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB for families in need, yes or no? right hon. Chair, discussions are ongoing on that, but I can assure Canadians we will continue to be there for them and support them, as we have been. Chair, a family that needs to buy groceries can't take those pretty words and buy groceries with them. We are engaged with stakeholders, with opposition parties and with Canadians to ensure that we continue to support them the way they need to be supported. Don from Burnaby sent me a note saying he's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened. He sent an email saying he's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he's frightened that if the CERB runs out, and it is planned to run out at the end of this month, then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet. Will the Prime Minister extend the CERB so Don does not have to live in fear? right hon. Chair, as I said, and as we have been saying from the beginning, we will continue to be there to support Canadians who need it. The member opposite is not actually looking at the fact that we are proposing three significant helps for Canadians this afternoon. We are proposing to help Canadians with disabilities, to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the CERB. One of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for Canadians living with disabilities. Will the government commit to helping all Canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so? right hon. Chair, the NDP leader seems to have decided that rather than help 40%, or a significant portion, of people with disabilities, he wants to help none of them, because he's not going to allow the debate to move forward on this bill. Chair, I appreciate that the Prime Minister accepts that his plan only helps 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Often it's the poorest of Canadians living with disabilities who won't be helped with the plan the government is proposing. Chair, our proposal will help 100% of Canadians who receive the disability tax credit, including many veterans. Why is the NDP not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation? the chair: Mr. We made it very clear that if the government extends the CERB, if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all Canadians living with disabilities, we will move forward. Chair, as I have said from the beginning, we look forward to continuing to work with the members opposite to keep moving forward to help Canadians. I hope we're going to be able to actually have a debate and a vote on this important legislation this afternoon. the chair: We're now going to take a short pause to allow staff to change up in a safe way respecting COVID-19 procedure. alain rayes (richmondarthabaska, cpc): Mr.Chair, can the Prime Minister tell us whether we will have an economic update by the end of June? hon. bill morneau (minister of finance): Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the hon. When the situation is stable, we will have the chair: Once again, the floor goes to Mr.Rayes. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, most of the provinces in Canada are working on tabling economic updates by the end of June. bill morneau: I understand the importance of transparency and that is why we are trying every day to explain our investments to Canadians and to continue to be transparent with them. alain rayes: The Liberal government announced hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending during the pandemic, but it still refuses to provide an economic update in order to be transparent with Canadians.",
        " I repeat my question: why does this government not want to table an economic update by the end of June, when the provinces are doing so? hon. bill morneau: Every day, we explain the economic situation, our investments, the changes we are making, and our programs to improve the situation of Canadians during the pandemic. alain rayes: The Parliamentary Budget Officer himself does not understand why the federal government cannot deliver an economic update when the provinces can. Why are the government and the minister defying the Parliamentary Budget Officer, who is an independent officer and is requesting an economic update? hon. We think our approach of providing information daily is appropriate and we will continue to be transparent about our investments. When we listen to the minister and the Prime Minister talk, you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through, when they keep saying no, no, no. The provinces are doing it, the opposition parties are calling for it and the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. Why will the Minister of Finance not table an economic update so that all members of Parliament can do their verification work? hon. In the meantime, we will be adapting to the situation on a daily basis and making sure that we have the information we need to make our decisions and to make sure that Canadians understand our situation. alain rayes: Mr.Chair, one month ago, the Prime Minister announced with great fanfare that the eligibility criteria for the $40,000emergency loans for businesses would be more flexible to help self-employed entrepreneurs and businesses that pay themselves dividends to have access to them. However, as of todayit has been four weeks since that announcementbusinesses are still banging their heads on the doors of their financial institutions. In addition, even senior officials confirmed to me during a technical call on June2, last Tuesday, that this information would not be available for several weeks. Can the Minister of Finance, who says he wants to act quickly to help our businesses, explain why, after four weeks, it is still not possible to get the information the Prime Minister promised us from his doorstep? hon. mona fortier (minister of middle class prosperity and associate minister of finance): Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been listening and responding to small businesses and entrepreneurs across the country. In fact, we have even announced the expansion of the program's eligibility criteria to include many owner-managed small businesses with payrolls of less than$20,000. We are working around the clock to ensure that we are able to promptly provide small businesses across the country with the assistance they need. Can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel, hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on? hon. I had a good conversation with the mayor of Niagara Falls recently, and we believe in the importance of the tourism sector. If he has clear, specific projects in the tourism sector that he needs help with, I would ask that he please come and see me and have a conversation. Chair, the message from the president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Perrin Beatty, and also other industries, is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what's going to happen through the strategy. What I've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence. We have been consulting with businesses on the appropriate way to extend the wage subsidy so that we can continue to support businesses as they turn towards a safe restart. We've also looked very carefully at how we can ensure that the programs that we've put forward the chair: We'll go back to Mr. Because of the shortage, in my riding of Niagara West, dentists have to pay up to 10 times the amount for an N95 mask. Compared to early March, when will the government finally begin to produce enough PPE in Canada to meet Canadian demand? hon. We have mobilized over 700 Canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in Canada as part of a made-in-Canada initiative. What's the evidence of this? We know that the government procured 10 million substandard N95 masks that couldn't be used. Planes are arriving empty that should have been filled with PPE, and we received less than 5% of our total order of gloves. When will this government finally begin to take PPE equipment issues seriously and make enough in Canada to meet demands by Canadians? hon. Regarding the flights that returned from China without federal cargo, Air Canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount. In addition, with regard to the N95 masks that were referenced, the Government of Canada will not pay for masks that it does not use. Furthermore, as my colleague Minister Bains just stated, we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry. dean allison: At a time when the Prime Minister has ordered Canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed, at a time when Canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over Skype, at a time when Canadians are not allowed to get married, at a time when Canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park, at a time when restaurants are being fined $800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced, in these times, the Prime Minister's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing. Chair, why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the Prime Minister? Why the double standard? hon. Chair, as the member knows, this country has been gripped with the need to stand up with one another to fight the experience of racism that so many Canadians live with and that so many of our American cousins live with. As the member knows, local public health sets advice for regions that he specified, and I would encourage all Canadians to check with local public health advice before they resume activities. It can take upwards of a year for Veterans Affairs to adjust their rate scale to compensate, and they do not allow for retroactive reimbursement. What are the government's actions to alleviate this hardship for our men and women who stood guard for this country, our veterans? hon. Chair, the fact is that when we inherited the government, Veterans Affairs needed a lot of support from government. In fact, at that time, we invested $10 billion to make sure that Veterans Affairs was put in place and that we could provide the appropriate supports for veterans, like the pension for life, the centre of excellence on PTSD and the chronic pain centre of excellence. Thank you, Minister, for answeringor respondingto my question, although that really did not provide an answer, in my humble opinion. The opposition has put forward clear proposals, such as a one-time tax-free withdrawal being allowed for an RRSP or a RRIF. To help preserve their registered retirement income fund assets, we are reducing minimum withdrawals by 25% for 2020. As the market is volatile during this time, we continue to look at all ways that we can best help seniors during this difficult time. It is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as Beijing imposes the national security law in Hong Kong. Has our government started preparing a list of names for Magnitsky-style sanctions, yes or no? hon. Chair, as we have said, we and our allies are deeply concerned with Beijing's decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. With hundreds of thousands of Canadians living in Hong Kong, we have a vested interest in its stability and prosperity, the foundations of which are Hong Kong's relative autonomy and basic freedoms. It's time for action, because the Chinese embassy has said, in response to Canada's expressed concern, that they deplore, reject and condemn our response and our concerns thus far. What are the conditions for this government using Magnitsky sanctions should China continue to incarcerate Canadians and jeopardize the human rights of its citizens? hon. We will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the Hong Kong population. Canada will always support and promote freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world. Chiu, we have about 22 seconds, so you have time for a very quick question and hopefully a very quick answer. When will this government listen to Canadians and call for a stronger, more effective and truly independent international investigation into COVID-19's origin? the chair: The honourable minister has 22 seconds or less, please. It is critically important that all countries in the world work together in a transparent, open and respectful manner so that we understand what is going on and how we can bring it to an end as quickly as possible. Chair, if the government orders someone who has been exposed to a confirmed COVID case into a 14-day quarantine, why won't the government allow them to take an antibody test to lift the quarantine so they can go back to work? hon. patty hajdu: As the member opposite may or may not know, testing strategies are determined by provinces and territories. Furthermore, the testing of a particular person has to be done at the right point in time the chair: We go back to Ms. My friend and colleague here, Colin Carrie, from the constituency of Oshawa, has a constituent who has a test. Why won't they provide a DIN number to it so that Canadians have access to it as well, regardless of which province or territory they live in? hon. Any test kit that would be approved by Health Canada would be accessible to wherever that company chose to market that test kit. Furthermore, it's really important that test kits that are approved by Health Canada be accurate and have been tested with rigour with regard to their ability to provide credible and accurate information to the people who are using that test. Chair, the test has proven to have an accuracy rate of 90% in identifying whether or not an individual has antibodies. Chair, I am happy to follow up with the member opposite's office when she is able to provide me with the name of the company. cheryl gallant: How long will it take for an antibody test to be approved by this government once you have the name of the company and the test and the evidence in front of you? the chair: Before we go to the honourable minister, I just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly. patty hajdu: We have an expedited process that could be completed in as little as five to seven days, depending on the accuracy of the test and the information supplied by the vendor. Chair, will Health Canada use reputable data from other countries to speed their determinations about antibody effectiveness, or just continue to withhold access? hon. patty hajdu: Canadians expect us, at Health Canada, to ensure the accuracy and the safety of all equipment approved for use in Canada. Chairman, if the minister can approve tests and studies within five days, why is it taking over 30, over 60, or over 90 days to approve an antibody test that exists? hon. patty hajdu: I appreciate the member opposite's interest in urgent and quick approvals; however, sometimes, depending on the company, there may be further questions and further tests that need to be run to ensure the accuracy or safety of that equipment. Should she wish me to check into the process for a particular the chair: We will go back to Ms. cheryl gallant: Have officials provided the government with a target for a daily antibody test to complete an initial survey or the initial phase of a study? hon. Chair, I assume the member opposite is talking about the work of the immunity task force, which is, as you know, a group of scientists who have been funded by the Government of Canada the chair: We'll go back to Ms. Chair, would the minister please provide the names of the people on the task force to which she just referred? hon. cheryl gallant: I hope that will be within the next two days or so, and not wait until after the crisis has passed, Mr. Why isn't the Prime Minister showing as much fervour for antibody testing as he is for getting a vaccine on the market? hon. In fact, the Prime Minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage. pat kelly (calgary rocky ridge, cpc): When will the government give the Auditor General the funds she needs to do her job? hon. On behalf of the government, I would also like to offer her our full support and collaboration the chair: We'll go to Mr. pat kelly: I share the minister's wish to congratulate the new Auditor General on her position. Chair, our government has added 38 permanent staff positions to her office, while the Conservative government, under their leadership, cut the funding for more than 60 the chair: We'll move on to Mr. If he will look at the committee transcripts of the time, he will know that it was the Auditor General's decision to reduce their own budget. The finance committee yesterday, with the support of Liberal backbench MPs who are on that committee, unanimously passed a motion to fund the Auditor General in full so that her office can do her job. If this minister will not listen to me, will he at least listen to his own backbenchers? hon. Chair, our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the Auditor General, an independent officer of Parliament. If the Auditor General identifies the need for additional resources, we will work with the Office of the Auditor General to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively. Chair, the Auditor General has consistently, since 2018, told this government that the office doesn't have enough funds. It's the first time in history that the Auditor General has had to tell public accounts that they don't have the resources to do their job. When will this government actually do the right thing and fully fund the Office of the Auditor General? hon. If the Auditor General identifies a need for additional resources, we will work with her to ensure that her office can continue to deliver its mandate efficiently and effectively. With this increase, the office was able to add the equivalent of 38new full-time staff to its team. I would ask the minister to please stop with the platitudes and actually just say yes or no. Chair, we have already increased the budget of the Office of the Auditor General in the 2018-19 period. the chair: Before we continue, we're going to suspend for a second to bring in the next chair. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): There's a point of order. It's always customary to give members a chance to correct the record, so I call upon the minister to do so now, and perhaps even the Prime Minister. I have here the transcripts of the public accounts committee, and they will confirm that the the acting chair (mrs. I would also like to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. While Quebec estimates its additional health care costs related to COVID-19 at $3billion, Ottawa is transferring around $115million, which is not even4%. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, as the member opposite knows, we invested an initial $500 million in transfers to the provinces and territories to manage the extreme pressure put on health care systems as a result of their supporting people living with COVID and in preventing COVID. We want to thank the provinces and territories for their work, and as the member opposite knows, we will continue to be there for the provinces and territories. The government is giving about $115million to Quebec, but that is not even 4%of what is being requested. patty hajdu: We have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis. We have been able to make so much progress in the fight against COVID-19 precisely because of this co-operation. gabriel ste-marie: MadamChair, it isn't about squabbling, it's about needs. What we're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care. Can the government commit to better funding to the health care sector and to organizing a meeting with Quebec and the provinces on this exact topic, in September at the latest? We can't afford to wait. patty hajdu: Madam Chair, with respect to the transfers to provinces and territories, the member opposite knows that our government, in our last mandate, significantly increased transfers to the provinces and territories for health services, including mental health and home care services. In fact, the funding we're providing is in addition to the $40 billion that was transferred the acting chair (mrs. alexis brunelle-duceppe (lac-saint-jean, bq): Thank you, MadamChair.   Tudo bem? Tudo bom?  Today in La Presse, we learned that the government has extended its military presence in long-term care homes. Can the minister confirm this information, and can he also confirm that the presence of these 500soldiers is indeed in response to a request from the Government of Quebec? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, let me assure the member that when Quebec made a request for assistance at the beginning of April, we answered the call. I had a conversation today with Minister Guilbault, my counterpart in Quebec, and we have renewed our commitment to continuing to provide assistance. That assistance can take additional forms and can include involving the Canadian Red Cross, but we remain committed to providing the assistance that Quebec needs. alexis brunelle-duceppe: If I understand correctly, negotiations are still under way with the Government of Quebec, even though it needs these soldiers. We have to make sure that the military will stay in our long-term care homes as long as we need their services in Quebec, and until new attendants have been trained. bill blair: I'd like to assure this House that we have assured Quebec that the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to provide support until such time as other trained professional people are able to do that job. We will be there for Quebeckers because they need our help, and as long as they need our help, we'll be there to support them. alexis brunelle-duceppe: This isn't the time to play cat-and-mouse. The only thing we have to do is to give the Government of Quebec what it's asking for. Quebec has more than 5,000deaths from COVID-19, 90%of which have been in seniors' residences or long-term care homes. Will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty? It's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers, who rely on this support. We have made a commitment to the Province of Quebec that we will continue to provide that support until the middle of September, exactly as they have requested, but we are also working to ensure that we have an sustainable, effective solution to the request that Quebec has made, so we're working with the Province of Quebec, the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian Red Cross to ensure the help that is needed is there. Madam Chair, COVID-19 continues to create challenges for all Canadians, including those with disabilities, and exacerbates those experienced by Canadians with disabilities. As we mark the end of National AccessAbility Week, I would like to remind our colleagues that our commitment to making Canada more inclusive and equitable is ongoing, including our passing of the Accessible Canada Act. Would the minister inform the House about the government's plans to support Canadians with disabilities who are experiencing increased costs due to COVID-19? hon. carla qualtrough (minister of employment, workforce development and disability inclusion): Madam Chair, last week was the first National AccessAbility Week that was legislated under the historic Accessible Canada Act, and I thank every party in this House for the consent they gave to that legislation. I'm hoping we have the same spirit of camaraderie for people with disabilities this afternoon. Since the beginning, Madam Chair, we have taken a disability inclusion approach on how we support people with disabilities in this time of pandemic, including the establishment of our COVID-19 disability advisory group, which has given us invaluable advice. Last week we announced a suite of measures to support people with disabilities that complement existing measures that are in place. This includes a one-time payment of $600 to 1.25 million citizens with disabilities, which again is the subject matter of the legislation this afternoon, as well as a $15-million investment in an accessible workplace initiative that will ensure, moving forward.... Finally, there are five really exciting accessible technology initiatives, including working on point-of-sale terminals for Canadians who are blind or visually impaired. bryan may: I want to take this opportunity to thank the minister and her department for all the work they are doing to ensure that accessibility is at the forefront of everybody's mind through this crisis. shaun chen (scarborough north, lib.): Madam Chair, as humanity battles COVID-19, we are confronted by the stark realities of another disease. On May 25, George Floyd fell unconscious and died as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. This all happened after the 46-year-old black man was handcuffed and put in a position where he could do no harm. In Canada, we have come a long way since Viola Desmond, yet there is much more to do. Hatred has no boundaries, whether it is against black communities or is anti-Asian sentiment fuelled by COVID-19. The question always is this: Who is next? We must all stand up together against hatred and for justice and reconciliation, to dismantle systems of oppression that long remained unquestioned. Recent data from Statistics Canada shows that Canada is failing black youth, creating the conditions that push them into the justice system. To the Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, my question is this: What is the government doing to address the unique challenges faced by black youth? hon. bardish chagger (minister of diversity and inclusion and youth): Madam Chair, the member for Scarborough North is absolutely correct. We often say that today's youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow but the leaders of today, so we need to equip them for success by investing in youth. According to the 2016 census, black Canadians accounted for 1.2 million people, and more than a quarter of that population is under the age of 15. Socio-economic gaps, such as in employment and education, exist between black and non-black youth. We have Canada's first youth policy, and it was created by youth for youth to ensure that all young people are equipped to live healthy and fulfilling lives, and are empowered to create positive change for themselves and their communities. Our government launched the community support for black Canadian youth program, which supported 56 projects geared to address the unique challenges faced by black Canadian youth through the development of leadership skills and civic engagement, while empowering them through the promotion of black history, culture and identity. To address the challenges of the pandemic, our government has implemented a suite of measures designed to help youth and students, including with employment and service opportunities. My office is working with community organizations who serve black youth to make sure they too are both aware of and benefiting from these measures. Will the government bring in legislation that would enshrine into law access to, and federal funding for, quality affordable child care? hon. ahmed hussen (minister of families, children and social development): Madam Chair, we are, of course, committed to investments in child care. We have constantly worked with provinces and territories to ensure that we provide the supports they need to provide quality, affordable and accessible child care. We are committed to creating an additional 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces. lindsay mathyssen: The government doesn't seem to understand that this is not universal child care. During COVID-19, women have lost the majority of jobs, and they have taken on the majority of additional child care responsibilities. Canadian women want and need to return to work, but this government doesn't understand that without affordable child care, they simply cannot re-enter the workforce. For 26 years, Liberal governments have been promising, but failing to deliver, a universal child care program. Since 2015, we have created 40,000 affordable, accessible, quality child care spaces across the country. We are on track to continue to invest $7.5 billion over 11 years to create additional child care spaces and support provinces and territories. We will be there for parents as they get back to work, and we will continue to reinforce the early learning and child care sector. Instead of helping parents return to work, the government is now bringing forward legislation that's penalizing them. Why is the government looking to sentence mothers and fathers to jail time and large fines when they cannot find the child care that the acting chair (mrs. It's an honour to be here, and I'm hoping that you and your family stay safe at this time. COVID has shaken up Canada's middle class, so my question is for the Minister of Middle Class Prosperity. She runs her own business, a travel agency, but because of COVID she has been wiped out. Will the minister fight for an extension of CERB so this woman can stay in the middle class? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, we know how worried Canadians are as they see their final four-week period of the CERB approaching, and we're working very hard to ensure that the CERB continues to serve an important purpose as we move into economic recovery. Now we're asking people to go back to work if it's safe for them to do so. In fact, the measures in today's legislation will help us to get the flexibility to be able to do just that. We need a Minister of Middle Class Prosperity in a time of middle-class disparity, and she has talked about middle-class criminality. Will the minister assure us that this man will be able to stay in the middle class because the CERB will still be there in July, yes or no? hon. mona fortier: MadamChair, since the beginning of the crisis, we've been helping Canadians by putting programs in place. charlie angus: The issue here is that when COVID hit, millions of Canadians were living in such precarious working conditions that they didn't even have enough money to pay their rent. What I need to know from the minister, and what Canadians need to know, is whether she will commit, yes or no, that the CERB will be there for those who have no work to go back to. mona fortier: MadamChair, since the beginning of the crisis, we have been helping families with a supplement to the Canada child benefit. It was all the way back on March 25 that the Minister of Finance stated that help for the energy sector was coming within hours, possibly days. Seventy-seven days after the minister made that statement, not a single energy company has received financing under EDC, the BDC, or the LEEFF program. As the energy sector faces an unprecedented liquidity crisis, how can this government possibly justify such a delay? hon. seamus o'regan (minister of natural resources): Madam Chair, weeks ago we opened applications through the business credit availability program to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. We've also opened applications for measures that will be available to our larger players through our LEEFF program. We will continue to support workers, and we will continue to do so to get through this unprecedented challenge. michael cooper: Madam Chair, on June 2, the vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said, The entire industry is frustrated with the delay that we are facing. The Saskatchewan Minister of Energy and Resources has spoken about a gaping hole that exists in terms of support for the energy sector. The gaping hole that I'm speaking of is the EDC and BDC programs that this government has failed to deliver upon.",
        " Indeed, it was on April 17 that those programs were announced, and 54 days later, not only has not a single energy company received financing, but guess what? They can't even apply, and the eligibility criteria have yet to be finalized after 54 days. seamus o'regan: Madam Chair, the Business Council of Alberta has said that the LEEFF program is a positive development showing that the federal government recognizes the needs and value of Canada's large corporations. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through two crises: the impacts of COVID and the effects of a global price war initiated by Russia and Saudi Arabia. That's why, weeks ago, we opened applications for liquidity measures to support the small and medium-sized players that make up 85% of the jobs in our sector. michael cooper: Madam Chair, contrary to the representations of the minister, neither the EDC program nor BDC programs are accepting applications. Just yesterday officials from both BDC and EDC were before the finance committee, where I posed precisely those questions to them. We know, Madam Chair, that the application process isn't up and running and that eligibility criteria remain to be determined, but I guess this government has some good news for the energy sector after 77 days. Is that the kind of help the Minister of Finance had in mind after 77 days: email updates instead of real relief for the energy sector? hon. seamus o'regan: Madam Chair, the Alberta finance minister, Travis Toews, said in a LEEFF announcement that in combination with earlier measures for small and medium-sized companies, it represented an expression of confidence in our industries. It is essential that we support our oil and gas sector as it suffers through these two crisesas I said, the impact of COVID, and then on top of that, the effect of a global price war. We supported small and medium-sized players essential to the supply chain, who make up 85% of the jobs in that sector, and then we announced liquidity made available to our larger players through the LEEFF program. alexandra mends): I now have to interrupt for a few moments to allow our technicians to change places. richard martel (chicoutimile fjord, cpc): MadamChair, there has recently been positive progress in AndrGauthier's case, and I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Prime Minister for their co-operation in this matter. However, Mr.Gauthier is currently on his own in the United Arab Emirates, without a passport, waiting to settle civil lawsuits. What services does the minister intend to provide to help him, and when does he plan to repatriate AndrGauthier to Canada? hon. marc garneau: MadamChair, in all cases similar to Mr.Gauthier's, the Government of Canada, through its consular services, tries to do the best it can under the circumstances. richard martel: The House recognized on February18, 2020, that the 15weeks of sickness benefits provided by employment insurance were insufficient. They are being denied the CERB because they didn't lose their jobs because of COVID-19. In addition, some citizens are waiting for surgery, which is being delayed because of COVID-19. Of course, we understand that people who are no longer receiving EI benefits should have access to the CERB. richard martel: I've called on the Minister of Economic Development several times to be more flexible in establishing these programs, so that they are better adapted to the realities of the regions. Recently, it was the SMEs in Montreal that were monopolizing the funds earmarked for the regions. When will the Liberal government listen to the needs of regions like SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean? hon. mlanie joly: I thank my colleague for the opportunity to announce the good news that was mentioned on Radio-Canada this morning, namely, $71million more for the regions of Quebec. I will be happy to work with my colleague to ensure that the CFDC in his region can support businesses. According to a survey conducted by the Universit de Trois-Rivires in Quebec, the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region is apparently the most economically affected by COVID-19. Our region has forestry, the aluminum sector, GNL Qubec, tourism, the Port of Saguenay, Davie Canada, a military base and a tax centre. I'd like to tell my colleague that there will be other announcements to support the economic development of the beautiful region of SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. richard martel: Sustainable forestry development is at the heart of the economic development of Canada and for SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean. Canadians have reason to be proud of the use of the boreal forest in the fight against climate change. Currently, our innovative forest industry is experiencing many problems, and on top of that, there is the COVID-19 crisis. I will also be pleased to work with my colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, who is very familiar with the matter and who knows the challenges faced by the various businesses in the forestry sector, as well as the employees. We are hearing from women who are pregnant or who have just given birth and are being left out or told to go back to work. carla qualtrough: We know that there are many situations of Canadians who are about to or are just going on maternity or parental benefits who might not have access to their EI benefits due to not having accumulated enough time for COVID reasons. We're working very hard to make sure, as we did for fish harvesters, that we support all Canadians in these situations. This is something that has been brought to the government's attention for months now, and still nothing has been done. Had the government conducted a GBA+ analysis, they would have discovered this prior to rolling out inadequate programs for women. carla qualtrough: I can assure everyone in this House that we are very aware and deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on women and girls. As we move forward, we are, as I said earlier, taking into consideration improvements to the EI system, the wage subsidy and the future of CERB. jag sahota: Madam Chair, might I remind my honourable colleague that this Prime Minister said that every piece of legislation would go through a rigorous GBA+? Why was it not done? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member that we absolutely took into account the needs of women as we developed the CERB. jag sahota: Madam Chair, it is a simple question, and I will ask again. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, as I said, the needs of women and girls were taken into consideration every step of the way, from the beginning, as we worked to provide a comprehensive suite of support for Canadians across the country. jag sahota: Madam Chair, if that's the case, then how did you miss these gaps? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member that we didn't miss gaps. As we moved from supporting workers to supporting students to supporting seniors, and today to supporting people with disabilities, we are ensuring that everyone is covered by our measures. As this pandemic evolves and as we move into economic recovery, of course we're going to make sure that women in particular are supported in our measures. I'm very proud of how many senior women we have supported with our measures, how many women received the GST credit, how many women who lead families received the CCB one-time payment and how many women with disabilities will receive the disability support if we have all-party consent today. jag sahota: Madam Chair, I will ask again, hoping for a straightforward answer from this minister. I'll say again how important it was from the very beginning that we took into account the needs of women and girls, and as we move forward into the economic recovery phase, how completely we make women at the core of every decision. Why was a GBA+ analysis not conducted on the COVID-19 relief programs? the acting chair (mrs. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, we've taken into account the needs of women and girls from the beginning, and we'll continue to do so. colin carrie (oshawa, cpc): Madame Chair, on April 29 I asked Minister Blair why Lisa Freeman, a constituent of mine, wasn't able to participate in the Parole Board hearing of her father's murderer. The minister acknowledged that this had been a mistake and that victims would now be able to attend by telephone and video conference. Can the minister tell this House how many parole hearings have been conducted under this digital format with victims since April 29? hon. I'm glad to hear that Minister Blair was able to provide information on the specific case he raises. colin carrie: Madame Chair, on April 29 the minister said, and I quote, Steps have been taken to make it possible for victims to participate in those parole hearings virtually by phone or video conference. If the change has been made, can the minister please tell us how many hearings victims have been able to participate in by video conference? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I said, certainly we will confirm the number of hearings that may have occurred. With regard to the hearings under the Parole Board of Canada, we want to ensure that victims and others are able to participate in a fair and transparent manner. colin carrie: Madame Chair, the website says, To protect the health and safety of the public, offenders, Parole Board...members and staff in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PBC is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference. However, when referring to victim participation, the PBC says it has Implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims...the ability to participate...via telephone. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I said, it is very important that all parties be able to participate before the Parole Board. The Parole Board has introduced technologies to allow victims to participate in a manner that is fair and that accords them the opportunity to express themselves. For victims, besides the criminal trial, the Parole Board hearings are the only chance to participate in the judicial process. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I've said now on a number of occasions, victims are able to participate in the hearings before the Parole Board. colin carrie: Then, Madam Chair, why did the minister and this government tell Canadians and the House that victims of crime have the opportunity to participate in parole hearings by video conference, when in fact they do not? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, as I've said, of course we are going to confirm the status of that particular request. In the meantime, as I've said on a number of occasions, victims are able to participate in these hearings. When will the minister finally give victims of crime the same right to parole hearings by video conference as he gives convicted inmates? hon. The Parole Board is a well-established tribunal that does allow for all parties, including victims, to participate in a manner that is fair, and that allows them to express themselves so those representations can be taken into account in the decisions of the Parole Board of Canada. colin carrie: He can reject it as much as he wants, Madam Chair, but it seems he thinks it's fair that inmates have that right, but victims don't. On May 19, the Prime Minister announced the government would allow sole proprietors and gig contractors to qualify for the Canada emergency business account; however, Brandon has still not been able to take advantage of this benefit. When can small business owners like Brandon expect this change to finally be made? It's been over three weeks, and the clock is ticking. mary ng (minister of small business, export promotion and international trade): Madam Chair, from the very beginning, we have been working hard to support our small businesses. Shawn and Denise operate a gymnastics facility in Whitby and have been forced to close throughout COVID-19. As the economy begins to open, they are concerned about not having the money to pay their employees in the short term, especially at a reduced client capacity. Is the government extending the wage subsidy to small businesses that have been closed and are just beginning to open now? hon. We hope businesses like that one will be able to take advantage of the wage subsidy to keep their employees on staff. Just to put it on the record, because we may or may not be debating it, the draft embargoed bill that we've seen is unacceptable to members of the Green Party caucus. I certainly appreciate her work and I know her intentions are the best, but part 3 of this bill allows for the information to be shared so people can get a one-time payment of $600, which is not enough to really deal with the COVID crisis for people with disabilities. It's clearand I thank the honourable leader of the New Democratic Party for making this point clearly in question periodit will reach approximately 40% of people with disabilities because of the structure of going through the disability tax credit. To the honourable minister, are other measures under consideration to reach the rest of the people in Canada with disabilities who need help? hon. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, the disability support payment we are proposing and that we hope to get through the House today complements a whole suite of measures our government has put in place that people with disabilities have access to. We know that people with disabilities who were precariously employed are now taking advantage of the CERB. Students with disabilities get the student benefit, including a $750-per-month top-up for four months. All around, Madam Chair, we're trying to get to every citizen with a disability, and this measure fills an important gap. elizabeth may: Much worse than part 3, from our point of view, is the treatment of people who are at this point potentially to be jailed for refusing to return to work when it's considered reasonable and they are recipients of CERB. To the minister, what's reasonable, and in whose eyes is it reasonable? In today's news, Hamilton's chief medical officer says there is a spike in cases among young people, who likely were exposed while taking public transit to get to work. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, as with the current CERB, moving forward it tries to encompass the situations of people who are unemployed, people who can't work because of child care responsibilities, people who are ill or sick. We're trying to look at the person and their particular circumstances as we work to ensure that if someone is immunocompromised and can't take transit to their job, then it's reasonable for them not to take that job. elizabeth may: The approach is so very flawed, Madam Chair, in that it attempts to punish people as opposed to encouraging them. I think the Liberals have been overly influenced by the Conservative Party's cries that there's vast fraud, that Canadians are cheating. The reality is that if you want to create an incentive to go back to work, you don't threaten people. You let people continue to receive CERB, but maybe less as they begin to earn more, so that you have a transition on a sliding scale to go into the wage subsidy or into CERB. I ask the honourable minister this: How can it be considered fair to say that someone isn't eligible, even though they believed they were? The language in this bill, particularly at proposed paragraph 12.1 in the penalties section, is an unreasonable determination that someone has violated the act and is subject to jail time and heavy fines. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, because of parliamentary privilege, I can't and won't speak to specific acts of a piece of law that hasn't actually been introduced in the House, but I'll tell you that what we're trying to do is enhance our integrity measures. We're working with those people who made an honest mistake, those who took advantage of returning to work when they were still receiving the CERB. I'm going to be sharing my time with the member from EsquimaltSaanichSooke. Tourism is a critical part of the economy throughout my riding, and after struggling with years of forest fires and floods, tourism was set to have a record-breaking year in 2020, but the COVID epidemic has burned tourism to the ground, in the words of a local leader. Many of them are small seasonal operations that don't qualify for any of the government's COVID support programs. While funding for ad campaigns is appreciated, these businesses need direct support and they need certainty about that support. Can the finance minister pledge now to provide direct and timely support to tourism businesses in my riding? hon. Yes, we were looking forward to another record-breaking year in 2020, but unfortunately the pandemic happened, and therefore many businesses were impacted. That's why, as a government, we're there to help with the wage subsidy, which has been extended until the end of August, as the tourism sector has been asking us to do; with the CEBA loans, the $40,000 loans, which also include a subsidy; and with the commercial rent relief. One thing that has allowed the wine industry to grow so dramatically in the past few decades is the excise tax exemption. That exemption could likely end very soon if it is found to be non-compliant with our trade agreements. Can he assure this House and the industry that the government will act immediately to implement this program? the acting chair (mrs. We recognize how important the wine industry is in B.C., and I assure the honourable member that I will come back to him and give him an update. randall garrison (esquimaltsaanichsooke, ndp): Madam Chair, this is National Blood Donor Week in Canada. More than 17 other countries have no deferral because they know that behaviour-based screening provides better security for the blood supply than identity-based exclusions. Will the Minister of Health do more than repeat those same promises today and instead take action to get this unscientific and discriminatory gay blood ban lifted? hon. jean-yves duclos (president of the treasury board): Madam Chair, I'm glad to be able to answer this very important question. randall garrison: The government knows I've been calling on friends, family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who cannot. Not only do we need routine blood donations, but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of COVID-19, we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered. jean-yves duclos: Madam Chair, I think the member used the right key words in referring to science and more prevention work to make sure that everyone lives in dignity and safety. Although there has been progress in the last few months and years on this important issue, there is more work to be done. randall garrison: Six years ago this week, I tabled a motion in the House that called for an end to this homophobic and transphobic ban on blood donations from gay men, men who have sex with men and trans women. Since we appear to have cross-party support for my new motion, M-41, that I put on the notice paper this week, would the minister and the government agree to support a unanimous consent motion to proceed with M-41 immediately? the acting chair (mrs. Homophobia and transphobia are examples of discrimination and absolutely important things not only to recognize but to fight against. That's why we are pleased to have voices such as the member of Parliament's voice to make sure that we make progress in making sure that everyone in Canada lives in safety and in dignity. maxime blanchette-joncas (rimouski-neigettetmiscouatales basques, bq): MadamChair, I will share my time with the honourable member for LongueuilSaint-Hubert. As Quebec starts to gradually emerge from the general lockdown, the outlook for the recovery of the tourism industry remains bleak. The economy of several regions of Quebec depends on tourism to ensure stability and balance, which will be beneficial in the coming months. Is the Minister of Finance prepared to extend the Canada emergency response benefit beyond 16weeks to ensure a living wage for tourism workers? hon. carla qualtrough: MadamChair, as I said in English, we're working very hard to continue to be there for all Canadians, whether it's through the CERB or the Canada emergency wage subsidy. We're going to have news on this very soon, Madam Chair, but the point is that we want to make sure that all of these programs work well together, whether it's the wage subsidy or the CERB. We want to make sure that we incentivize work, but we still continue to be there for Canadians. maxime blanchette-joncas: We read that the government wants to gradually replace the Canada emergency response benefit by using the Canada emergency wage subsidy. That's all well and good, but seasonal industries aren't entitled to it under the current criteria. If the minister is aware of the importance of the tourism industry in the economic cycle of our regions, he must commit to helping workers. We simply need to make it an employment incentive so as not to hurt people who are lucky enough to be able to go back to work. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, we are working hard to make sure we continue to support Canadians as we transition through economic recovery. We want to make sure that we support Canadians, but of course we don't want to disincentivize work. We want to make sure that as we ask people to go back to work, we don't disincentivize work, but the reality is that there won't be jobs there for everyone, and we need to continue to support everyone. denis trudel (longueuilsaint-hubert, bq): MadamChair, I join my colleague in extending my good wishes to you on Portugal's national day. Apart from the fact that it is probably the most beautiful riding in Quebec, the riding of LongueuilSaint-Hubert has surely been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, both in terms of health and the economy. But we aren't close to being able to go back and see a show by WajdiMouawad or FredPellerin, and that's a shame. steven guilbeault: MadamChair, I thank my colleague for his question and all the work he's doing in arts and culture. We introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, for example, but also the emergency wage subsidy, which we made available to non-governmental organizations. To ensure that people who receive royalties aren't penalized under the Canada emergency response benefit, we have adapted it. Instead of giving a long preamble, I'll ask a very simple question: will the CERB be extended on July5? the acting chair (mrs. carla qualtrough: Madam Chair, I can assure the member opposite that in July we will be there for Canadian workers. denis trudel: In my riding, a nice little restaurant called Crpe Caf on St-Charles Street in Longueuil has just closed its doors. Another restaurant owner told me that he was going to reopen his restaurant, but he didn't know at what capacity. How many hours a week will it be able to offer its employees? Will it be 12hours, 15hours, 22hours? Will employees even want to return to work to put in 12hours a week? If the CERB isn't adjusted, nothing will happen. Will the government commit to extending the CERB and providing an employment incentive to get the economy moving again at full speed? hon. mlanie joly: MadamChair, I know, of course, that the restaurant sector has been much affected. If my colleague wants to work with me to provide support to restaurant owners and other restaurants in Longueuil, I'd be very happy to do so. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Madam Chair, last month, on May 5, I asked the government how it plans to support the agriculture sector. Now, one month later, our farmers, who provide the food we need, are still waiting on funds to be delivered. The New Brunswick potato industry is sitting on a massive amount of last year's crop that, because of the pandemic, has no buyers. When will the Prime Minister and the government step up and deliver the support our farmers so desperately need? hon. In addition to that, we have provided relief and support for migrant workers, who are ensuring that Canadians have access to safe and affordable food. richard bragdon: Madam Chair, when support for the agriculture sector was announced on May 4, our agriculture sector had been sounding the alarm for weeks that they needed help to continue to meet Canadians' food needs. It is worth noting, Madam Chair, that vegetables like the potatoes in New Brunswick that I previously mentioned are perishable products. Again, will the Prime Minister and this government make agriculture a priority and provide them with the support they desperately need right now? hon. mlanie joly: Madam Chair, obviously we believe in the importance of our regions and our rural communities, and that's why we've always made sure that agriculture was at the core of many of the decisions throughout this pandemic. That's why our colleague Minister Bibeau, who is the Minister of Agriculture, has been there providing the right liquidity and the right support through this pandemic. Of course we want to make sure that we continue to partner with provinces and territories, because we need their help in this context to make sure that all together we show strong economic support for our farmers, who are going through tough times. richard bragdon: On May 1 the Liberals introduced a sweeping firearms ban through an order in council that outlawed 1,500 firearms. Recent reports show that since then, more and more firearms are quietly being added to the list of banned firearms, including many common hunting rifles and shotguns. Madam Chair, our hunters, outfitters, dealers and sport shooters are some of the most vetted members of our society. Why does the Prime Minister insist on making criminals out of law-abiding firearms owners instead of dealing with the criminals we already have? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, I am very proud of this government's record when it comes to ensuring that we take out of our communities those guns that have one objective only, and that is to kill other people. We will always stand by that record, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to keep our communities safe. richard bragdon: Madam Chair, the Liberals have said that to compensate firearms owners, they will implement a national buyback program. Instead of targeting law-abiding firearms owners and their legally purchased private property, wouldn't the estimated quarter of a billion dollars needed to buy back these firearms be better utilized right now in supporting our agricultural sector, the very people who grow our food and literally keep our land? hon. marco mendicino: Madam Chair, of course we look forward to saying more about that, but of course we remain committed to taking those guns that have only one objective, and that is to kill people. The legislation we have introduced and the measures we have taken are designed to keep our communities safe, and of course we will do that. We will also continue to support farmers, introducing hundreds of millions of dollars in support because we know they are providing Canadians with affordable food. richard bragdon: Madam Chair, many sole proprietors have been hit extremely hard by this pandemic. My office has heard from many who have been in business for nearly 30 years and have submitted hundreds of HST returns, yet still cannot access the CEBA funding because they do not have a business chequing account, as a lot of small business owners use their personal chequing accounts to do their business. The Liberals offered aid to sole proprietors but attached unnecessary hurdles that prevent many of them from accessing the funds they desperately need to keep their businesses afloat. When will these unnecessary hurdles be removed so businesses can start to receive the relief they so desperately need? the acting chair (mrs. mlanie joly: We believe in the importance of making sure we're supporting our businesses, including sole proprietors. That is why our colleague, Minister Ng, the minister for small business, has been working on this and will continue to make sure we take the appropriate steps to recognize that. Meanwhile, people can definitely come to the regional development agencies if they don't have access to funding through banks, and that's a good way to make sure there is a backstop. alexandra mends): Please note that, pursuant to the Standing Order made on April20 and May26, the House has been recalled. Therefore, the committee will adjourn, and the House will begin sitting at 2:30p.m"

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "project manager:  and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? N user interface:   .  in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching ,  how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl  was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our  in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that  people l  people do have preference for tho fancy mobi  f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel  good . So we should take into  we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as  the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv   in our mark  means in take in designing our rem  remote controls . user interface: The last one is the most important one , is it ? marketing: No the first one is the user interface: Oh , sorry . marketing:  the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , project manager: user interface: Okay . marketing: the fancy design  rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo  remote controls are . So it  should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , user interface: marketing: there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi  remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated  like this way . And it should be  and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . marketing: Y yeah  yeah , we have to , because  d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , project manager: user interface: marketing: because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , user interface: Okay . industrial designer: We should make a big sponge lemon , marketing: becoming industrial designer: and then it'd be it would be yellow . marketing: And people  the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . marketing: So user interface: Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can marketing: No it ca y a user interface: Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? marketing: The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co user interface: Okay . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , user interface: Okay . marketing: because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , project manager: Alright , okay . marketing: so we don't want to have any harm to the society , user interface: -huh . marketing: user interface: And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? marketing: S  we didn't find out any such point . marketing:  yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so project manager: --  so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them ,  I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you  have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of  shape and  play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . project manager: user interface: And we've got some pictures of some  new remote controls to show you . user interface: Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just project manager:  no just escape should  user interface: Escape , okay . user interface: There's  an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . user interface: This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , project manager: - , like the middle button . user interface:  and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , industrial designer: project manager: Ah it's kinda like scrolling user interface: like would the computer come project manager:  right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of  menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . user interface: -huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , project manager: Right , okay . user interface: is it ? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . industrial designer: user interface: You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . user interface: And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . project manager: Yeah , I m  the one thing I think about about these ones is  these kl  secured areas  , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .  so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . project manager:  is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? user interface: I guess so . I like some of these things  the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out  that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .  but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different  buttons . project manager: 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? user interface: Yeah , exactly . So we need to combine those ones  industrial designer: user interface: and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . user interface: It's you program it like you say , record ,  and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah .  personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the industrial designer: The L_C_D_ user interface: Yeah . user interface: And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , marketing: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , user interface: are we ? marketing: but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . But our budget , we've project manager: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . marketing: So even if we increase our cost little bit , within  some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . user interface: I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros  per  twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . I can't see tha Although , th  to be to be sure they have got  they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , industrial designer: user interface: The L_C_D_ . project manager: so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small industrial designer: project manager: But  like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . industrial designer: project manager:  but , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , user interface: No . industrial designer: But  price price not withstanding  , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? marketing: And the project manager: Twelve fifty . marketing:  i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa project manager: Possibly . user interface: Yeah , that's the thing , because industrial designer: But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: It just seems kind of like a a needless th user interface: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . user interface: It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the  the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . industrial designer: So which vegetable ? project manager: Well  we could make a user interface: Yeah , I know , carrot . project manager: Well , si since we're going for the  the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s industrial designer: The the lemon . project manager: And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . So they'd be able to use that  , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . project manager: And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , project manager: Yeah , looks like it . industrial designer: and I'll I'll give you the  , I guess , technical considerations for those . project manager:  user interface: industrial designer: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . So , the way I'm gonna do this is  we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work ,  reuse the the vital kind of  essential pieces of it , project manager: industrial designer: and then we'll throw in our new innovations  and keep it all within budget . project manager: industrial designer:  you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , project manager: industrial designer:  and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which  receives input from the buttons , and ch project manager: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? industrial designer: Right , it's very they're very cheap remote .  so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the  to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , user interface:  so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the  project manager: Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? industrial designer: R  no ,  this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be ,  the board we have to use basically  the same set-up , processor ,  we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .  so for the casing ,  this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team  , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,  latex , double-curved , curved . industrial designer: what do we think ?  or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . project manager: Well ,  like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . industrial designer: Yeah so project manager:  so maybe s  a sort of  plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? industrial designer: Okay so , here are a a plastic ,  latex user interface: I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , project manager: Oh right , okay . user interface: you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and industrial designer: Oh right . industrial designer: and the colour is yellow , right ? user interface: Yeah , project manager: Or at least incorporating , yeah . project manager:  I forgot i we're sort of  I don't know what other standard silver kind of user interface: I think project manager: Other parts or  user interface:  . Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours project manager: user interface: or i if we're having buttons actually , industrial designer: So yellow for the body , user interface: I don project manager:  . industrial designer: and then what colour for the buttons ? project manager:  I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . user interface: You do have ones like  play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah or yeah a limit  maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .  if we are gonna make it a novel  double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer:  'kay so the shape we wanna go  how exactly ? Maybe double user interface: Like  an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , project manager: Yeah it's  , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . user interface: or just like a It's not industrial designer: What about a banana ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , project manager: Well , yeah ,  like industrial designer: 'cause it's yellow fruit , user interface: industrial designer: right ? project manager: Yeah , yeah . user interface: How would you point it ? industrial designer: Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . user interface: What industrial designer: We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: because then this this will help us in our advertisement also project manager: marketing: and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . project manager: Huh ? user interface: y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . industrial designer: So a spongy banana re marketing: project manager:  that that th user interface: Rubber banana . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? marketing:  the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , project manager: S industrial designer: See marketing: like people  now project manager: And sponginess . industrial designer: So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable user interface: And spongy , yeah . user interface: Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . industrial designer: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? project manager:  . project manager: user interface: 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: and industrial designer: and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . Well , I guess it's kind of dra  you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , user interface: No . industrial designer: Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . And buttons would , did we say ?  different shapes of buttons ? industrial designer: project manager:  I l I su  for the specific functions , you know , up and down ,  play , stop . industrial designer: Okay , so project manager: They've got , they've got standard sort of intuitive  industrial designer: so buttons . industrial designer: With the scroll-wheel or no ? user interface: Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? project manager:  speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . industrial designer: Where should I put the microphone ? project manager:  ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? user interface: Yeah , I'm not sure . industrial designer: Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? user interface: I couldn Yeah . project manager: And  I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or project manager: I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . user interface: And  so what else was there ?  the industrial designer: project manager: user interface: What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? project manager: I s I still like it . project manager: 'Cause  like  if we  how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? user interface: Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? industrial designer: They can work from a project manager: Yeah , you know , and then you just tal industrial designer: You don't have to hold it . project manager:   some  I user interface: Yeah , do we need buttons ? project manager: l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like  , I dunno , an apple . I quite like the design of that ,  'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . user interface:  project manager: user interface: and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . industrial designer: But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . marketing: we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . marketing: So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , user interface: In that w project manager: It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing  user interface: Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , marketing: S s sorry ? user interface: didn't you ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things marketing:  like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone  we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , project manager: user interface: so we could do that , like have a choice . marketing: okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . marketing: If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . user interface: We still need the buttons in the same places thought , marketing: Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . user interface: marketing: Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , user interface: Oh , that's the other side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . marketing: So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . marketing: And project manager: I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , user interface: Okay . project manager: 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . project manager: You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , user interface: Yeah . project manager: unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the user interface: industrial designer: Okay ,  so marketing: project manager: So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . industrial designer: Yeah , marketing: industrial designer: s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or project manager: Yeah . Well ,  because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and  because what project manager: Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . user interface: Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , project manager:  'kay . user interface: because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . project manager: So again  like we could have , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different user interface: Okay . project manager: colour , but have user interface: Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . project manager:   e even if user interface: Because project manager:  not necessarily that the  the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know  blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . project manager: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .  as for the energy source  , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that .  I don't know what that means , we crank it ? project manager:  It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . industrial designer: So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . marketing: But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? project manager: Yeah . marketing: Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat project manager: It does leave them with an obligation to marketing: Yeah , to mo Yeah . marketing: because most of the people project manager: Then if it's just sitting on the user interface: Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . marketing: solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and the days when there is no sola sunlight project manager: I'm I'm with  Raj on that , industrial designer: Okay , so probably just marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think , you know , marketing: What we w project manager: I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . project manager:  I w I w  user interface: project manager: that idea that I thought  just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother industrial designer:  . project manager: is having a , user interface: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? project manager: yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager: having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but  for using it as  recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . What's chip on print ? What's industrial designer:  ? project manager: Sorry , never mind . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , user interface: So  yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . project manager: Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . project manager: Okay , we're we're kind of  we're kind of  Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Was that you ? industrial designer: Huh ? project manager:  that was your bit's covered , industrial designer: Oh yeah that was that was it . project manager: and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . project manager:  yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . project manager: Yeah , can you save that  send that last one again , please , Raj , marketing: Yeah . project manager: as I still can't find it on the marketing:  it was under a different name . project manager: that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks  for some username or password . project manager: Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my  on my agenda .  okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and  .  no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , marketing: user interface: No I'm good . project manager:   we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a user interface:  "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ?

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "But all all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine . And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message and I have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code . professor d: So  so the  , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that  , we do the digit recordings at the end . And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's  meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time , then they can run off . It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer  , sets of digits , but  , I think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , if someone 's on strict time  , less .  , so , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about  , the nature of the data that we are collecting .  @ @ that  , we should have a fair amount of data that is  , collected for the same meeting , so that we can ,  I don't know . Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? Is it phd f: well , OK , I 'll back up . phd f: at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data  , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us , phd a: Well , great . phd f: And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , phd a: What a deal . grad b: And what 's he interested in , specifically ? phd f: So he 's comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , grad b:   Anyway , I thought OK , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in January , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . phd f: But , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b: One offs ? phd f: Yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the ,  to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , I was talking to Morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about .  it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . Then I was  , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to . And in that  , regard , I thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . So this this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . phd f: and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting . phd f: But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b: Yeah . phd f: but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar , grad b:   phd f: like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . grad b:  professor d: Now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that , but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too . professor d: As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have  too few people from my point of view . So ,  I think I would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and  , phd c:   professor d: sure , if we can get more from them , fine , postdoc e:   professor d: but if we only get one or two from each group , that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have close and distant microphones with different people . postdoc e: Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . Because I think if you just say an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in English that that  , it would be useful for for purposes You know . postdoc e: But you know , I think I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . And and the English you 'd have The language models would be really hard to build professor d: Well , you want to i postdoc e: because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a professor d: Well , OK , first place , I I I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that 's what we 're investigating , postdoc e: OK . phd f: It has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . professor d: So I was I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors  , and and and  , senior  , d and  , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . The second point is  I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and I th I think that postdoc e: Oh , oh . postdoc e: No , it 's more a matter of  , proficiency , e e just simply fluency . postdoc e: I deal with people on on campus who I think sometimes people , undergraduates  in computer science  , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong . professor d: You 're just talking about postdoc e: Well , e I just think , grad b: We all had the same thought . postdoc e: but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level , no problem . professor d: But grad b: Well , I think that ,  I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English . And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have  , g particularly good English skills . postdoc e: OK , now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that  , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . postdoc e: And if people want to approach  , i so I know e e You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group , professor d:  - huh . postdoc e: but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking  , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , professor d:   postdoc e: if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in  , i more fluent , more more close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . I postdoc e: Because otherwise y you don't have the ability to have  , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . If you have people who are using English as a as an interlanguage because they they don't  , they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing , language model , professor d:  - huh . professor d: Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . But the thing is , I think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that professor d: I see . postdoc e: I I 'm I 'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view , could we have a language model , a a grammar a grammar , basically , that  , wo would be a a possibility . postdoc e: So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , it seems like  , I don't see that there 's an argument professor d:   postdoc e: I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . professor d: OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get .  , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at  , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it will be OK , postdoc e: Yes , that 's fine . And my point in m in my note to Liz was I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . grad b: Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . professor d: Oh , you age - ist ! grad b: What 's that ? Well , age - ist . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not use the k equipment from IBM if they found something else , cuz there 's a professor d: They 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're  assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . phd f: Cuz  , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? And and  , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could  , record people there . I think we 'd have a better chance grad b: I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . But if there were such a  it 's a remote possibility , then  , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . phd f: So it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . professor d: Well , the other thing Yeah ,  the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .  , and grad b: Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS . phd f: But you may not need a separate room , you know , grad b: That 's true . phd f: the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something grad b: True . professor d: Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . grad b: Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . phd c: But I I I think you need , another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI . phd c: Eh , if you you want to to record , eh , a seminar or a class , eh , in the university , you you need It - it would be eh eh very difficult to to put , eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device . grad b: Yeah , but I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy . grad b: Right ? That 's very easy , phd c: Ye - Yeah , yeah . professor d: Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . We realized that , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . So , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , the way that you were speaking about with , not having an interlingua and  , these other issues . But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . So , a a as per the example that we wanna have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , typ number of types of meetings But we can also have another part that 's , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's OK too .  , i We realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ?  , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . But what about For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone . phd f: Right , I c I think there 's grad b: And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean . phd f: Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . postdoc e: Which one did you mean ? professor d: You d You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone , somewhere . professor d: but  phd f: use  , but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , professor d: Yeah . phd f: you know , each person who 's interested in  , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . phd f: And So in my case , I think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . phd f: And so I 'm looking and thinking , \" Well I 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . phd f: And other people need to do that for themselves , h or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal professor d: Right . professor d: But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , \" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , \" well maybe you don't . professor d: Maybe if if If really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a  , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . professor d: we we could have a fairly We could just get a DAT machine and phd f: Well , I agree with Jane , though , on the other hand that phd c: Yeah . phd f: So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . You may say well , \" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . phd f: But what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on  Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . phd f: So I do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . phd f: Otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so professor d:  but I I think that the  i We can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . professor d: And so ,  it took quite a while to get that together and to say , \" Oh , we 'll just do it up there , \" phd f: OK . professor d: If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o phd f: So then maybe we should try to bring people here . professor d: I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here . phd f: that 's that 's OK , so professor d: We 're set up for it . phd f: Yeah , I And I think we can get people to come here , that But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . professor d: Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food . professor d: Yeah grad b: Should I pursue that ? phd f: Oh , definitely , yeah . grad b: So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer , but I 'll send an email and ask . phd f: I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers , cuz these are both weird grad b: Right . professor d: The the The oth the other h phd f: well , I know , I shouldn't say that . The o the o the other The other thing is , that we we talked about is give to them  , burn an extra CD - ROM . professor d: and give them So if they want a basically and audio record of their phd f: Well , I thought that was I thought he meant , \" Give them a music CD , \" like they g Then he said a CD of the of their speech professor d: Oh . phd f: and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting , grad b: Mmm . Of the meeting ? phd f: but maybe yeah , maybe you 're professor d: If you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and  you 'd like phd f: right . professor d: We 're saying , \" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . It 's actually p It 's probably gonna be pretty useless to you , grad b: Yep . professor d: but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , phd f: Right . professor d: and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . phd a: What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? postdoc e: Alth phd f: But we might need a little more to incentivize them , that 's all . postdoc e: I hav I have to  raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , where maybe You know ? professor d: Good point . professor d: So we can so we can postdoc e: We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage . phd f: If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , grad b: That 's a good point . phd f: right ? professor d: Although it 's phd f: Otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone . postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right , say \" Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I \" grad b: Yeah . So that was that topic , and then  , I guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question for grad b: We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have  enough sp room to record meetings . So I  did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from  , Broadcast News . phd c: Eleven ? grad b: And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . phd a: Where did you copy it to ? grad b: Well , it 's Abbott . professor d: Sk - It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ? grad b: Tape . phd a: Ah ! grad b: So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files . postdoc e: One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . professor d: Is it ? postdoc e: it it it The other direction is fast , but this direction is really slow . phd a: Generating a clone ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's a good point . phd a: Oh ! Hunh ! professor d: S postdoc e: Now , what will  Is the plan to g to So stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ?  , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I ? grad b: No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable postdoc e: OK . grad b: And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . professor d: Or maybe six ? grad b: The SUN , ha  , takes more disks than the Andatico one did . The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . professor d: How many How much phd a: Is there a difference in price or something ? grad b: Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . I 've been looking at the , Aurora data and , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , SPINE . phd a: And so , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . So , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data . So I moved that , and then  , I asked him to check out and see if it was OK . I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . professor d: So , but ,  y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? grad b: Yep . So , so , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . phd a: OK , I but the stuff I 'm moving from Aurora is on the DC disk that we grad b: I don't remember . Yeah ,  we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand . And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks .  , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk . phd a: So should ,  One question I had for you was , we need we sh probably should move the Aurora an and all that other stuff off of the Meeting Recorder disk . Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b: We should put it onto the Broadcast News one . grad b: But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it . professor d: OK , @ @ So , then I guess th the last thing I 'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what Jose has been doing , phd c:  - huh .",
        " professor d: so phd c: I have , eh , The result of my work during the last days . Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project . phd c: But for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh , here 's i is the demonstration of the overlap , eh , problem . phd c: It 's a real problem , a frequently problem  , because you have overlapping zones eh , eh , eh , all the time . phd c: Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , with eh , a exact mark . Oh , you did that by hand ? phd c: Heh ? That 's eh , yet b b Yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh \" Why . \" grad b: Can I see that ? Can I get a copy ? professor d: Oh . phd c: My my idea is to work phd a: Wow ! phd c: I I I do I don I don't @ @ I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh , enough time to to to work .  , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . phd c: Eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? phd c: And No , no , with i grad b: Have you done that or are you planning to do that ? phd c: Sorry ? No , I I plan to do that . Darn ! phd c: I plan I plan , but eh , eh , the idea is the is the following . I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard about the my ideas . phd c: Eh , eh This information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone .  , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . And , I need t true eh , silence for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . phd c: And my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . postdoc e: Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the grad b: Yeah , fans . phd c: Eh , I  eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , professor d:   phd c: eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech . grad b: So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? professor d:   phd c: Yeah , I have mark in in in in that Not in all in all the the file , grad b:   phd c: only eh , eh , nnn , mmm , I have eh , ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity , but eh , I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones . I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information , grad b: Whew !   phd c: because with the program , I cross the information of  , of Jane with eh , my my segmentation by hand . phd c: And the the idea is , eh , I I will use , eh , I want My idea is , eh , to eh to classify . phd c: I I need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones because I I want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label indicating . I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong . phd c: Eh , the class you will overlapping speech \" overlapping \" is a class , eh , \" speech \" @ @ the class that 's grad b: Nonspeech . phd a: These will be assigned by hand ? phd c: a I I I ha I h I I put the mark by hand , phd a: Based on the  - huh . phd c: because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , I need , eh , I I need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , I I will cluster , is is right . Because , eh , eh , if not , eh , I will I will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , grad b: Well , training , and validation . And I I 'd prefer I would prefer , the to to have , eh , this labeled automatically , but , eh , eh , fro th I need truth . So , the difference between the top two , i So so I start at the bottom , so \" silence \" is clear . By \" speech \" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ? phd c: Speech Yeah . postdoc e: So this is un OK , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . phd c: Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones , eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker , or three speaker , or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker eh , overlaps eh , onto eh , a speech , another , especially speech . postdoc e: So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be . phd c: No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech from , eh , different eh , eh , speaker . Eh professor d: No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying \" Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ? \" phd c: Ah ! professor d: Which category do you put that in ? postdoc e: Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh , from , eh , one speaker without , eh , eh , any any any events more . postdoc e: Oh ! professor d: Right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? phd c: Where ? Where What is the class ? professor d: Which catege which category ? postdoc e: Like a c phd c: No . phd c: For for the by the @ @ no , @ @ because I I I I want to limit the the nnn , the the study . grad b: Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . phd c: \" Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? \" because i it 's the first study . In the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class , phd a: Is is phd c: to consider all the all the information , you you mentioned before professor d: Yeah . phd c: but eh , the the first idea Because eh , I don't know what hap what will happen with the study . i it 's pure phd a: What if there was a door - slam or something ? phd c: No , no , it 's pure silence . professor d: What you Well w I I think what you m I think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises . professor d: Right ? Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling \" event \" is somebody coughing or clicking , or rustling paper , or hitting something , which are impulsive noises . Right ? phd c: h here yet , yet I I I I I think I I think , eh , there are that some kind of noises that , eh , don't don't wanted to to be in that , eh , in that control set . phd c: But I prefer , I prefer at at the first , eh , the the silence with eh , this eh this kind of the of eh of noise . professor d: Right , it 's  , it 's \" Background \" might be might be a better word than \" silence \" . phd c: And , with this information The idea is eh , eh , nnn , I have a label for for each , eh , frame and , eh with a cluster eh algorithm I and postdoc e: Well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . And eh I am going to prepare a test bed , eh , well , eh , a a set of feature structure eh , eh , models . phd c: I have to to test , but eh I phd a: You have your own ? phd c: Yeah , yeah , yeah . Is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker , eh , from , eh , Standar - eh Stanford University in Stanford ? No . phd a: Oh ! What 's it written in ? phd c: Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author , because I I have several I have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , Festival and of from Edinburgh eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . phd c: And And I have to because , in general the pitch tracker , doesn't work very well and grad b: Bad . This this is And th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh FEC for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data grad b: Supervised clustering . phd c: and the second is try to eh , to use some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis . phd c: Eh ? Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters . What sort of classifier ar ? phd c: Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different . grad b: Unimodal ? phd c: Is Yeah ? W with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . grad b: So is it just one cluster per phd c: A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . phd c: But eh what 's the p What is my idea ? What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? If w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you can't you can't eh , eh put up with your hand in the different parameter , grad b: Right , you can't analyse it . phd c: but eh If you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . professor d: Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are . professor d: It 's hard to w w what you It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally . professor d: But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized . professor d: Well , this isn't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if phd c: Yeah . phd c: But professor d: Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , grad b: Right . professor d: in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gonna be a mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what what  phd c: And grad b: Right . professor d: I  , I think the other thing that one  , this is , I think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least See what I 'd I 'd Let me tell you what I would do . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever , I would just take a couple . professor d: OK ? Like like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . professor d: OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers , just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart . professor d: That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier . professor d: And the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort  , or or else have features that really are based on  on on some bigger chunk of time . But don't  anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know phd c: Yeah . professor d: what it 's doing , even You know it 's  , I think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's grad b: Yep . professor d: look at at som some picture that shows you , \" Here 's These things  ,  are offer some separation . \" And , in LPC , the thing to particularly look at is , I think is something like , the residual phd c: Yeah . S postdoc e: Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information  , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . phd c: I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective professor d:   But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC . But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose . phd c: you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm professor d:   phd c: because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . phd c: A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p  , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . grad b: I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said . What what model ? postdoc e:  phd c: Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer . phd c: And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net postdoc e: So p phd c: with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . phd c: you you eh , eh have obtained in the first eh , step with the for example , BIC eh , eh criterion compare model postdoc e:   phd c: And You I don't - u professor d: OK , but , I I think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is phd c: i postdoc e: Yeah . professor d: Because what we had before for for  , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps . professor d: So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . professor d: Right ? So again , I think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these  , in in in in grad b: Features ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , I again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too way too big . professor d: OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order  MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . professor d: Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on . professor d: Well , you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , phd c: Yeah . professor d: so if you look at Suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , phd c: Yeah . professor d: right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe .  , and  on the other hand , the LPC residual , the energy in the LPC residual , will say how well ,  the low - order LPC model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . professor d: And so I i again , if you take a few of these things that are are prob  promising features and look at them in pairs , I think you 'll have much more of a sense of \" OK , I now have  , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . phd c: but eh , eh eh eh eh I don't know it is the first eh way to to do that and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion . Eh all this study in the f in the first moment , I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh equalizes speech . grad b: With postdoc e: With what ? With what ? grad b: Right . phd c: Eh , why ? Because eh the spectral distortion is more eh a lot eh clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the PDA . phd c: fff ! Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low . phd c: I don't know eh  i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files . phd c: eh What , I  , what what is the effect of the low ' signal to to to noise relation , you know , eh with professor d: N u We Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . professor d: And so , if you can get @ @  again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible  , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect ,  in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . professor d: And then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b: Right . Because it I think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and And don't professor d:  . professor d: That 's well , the It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . phd c: I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh , eh worked with both eh , speech file , postdoc e: That 's good . phd c: but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the PDA speech files . Is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you I I I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s some parts is very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . phd c: Is very difficult to apply eh , eh a parameter to detect change when you don't see . Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are  , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . phd a: Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , but w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA professor d: Nah . phd a: because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ?  grad b: Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . professor d: Yeah , no , you you 're you 're right grad b: But that 's professor d: that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one and and so that 's phd a: Is that not allowed with this project ? professor d: well , no , we we don't have any rules , r really . professor d: I think I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question . professor d: I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . professor d: if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . professor d: But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . postdoc e: There there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , it it it does , i it d it does , but the the the issue is that that phd a: No , it 's not it 's not that so much as postdoc e: And then , And if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking . postdoc e: He You mentioned this last time , that that if if you 're straight down the midline , then then the r the left - right 's gonna be different , grad b: Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable , phd c: I I I I I th grad b: and phd a: Well , it 's phd c: Yeah . postdoc e: It seems to me that that it 's not a p  , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated . phd a: I don't I don't know ho phd c: I I I think Sorry . I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is very near . But it 's  from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because I I found difference between the the speech from from each micro eh , in the PDA . It - it 's not amplitude , postdoc e: Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves . postdoc e: But I 'm just I 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA , phd c: No . postdoc e: so we 're gonna have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . phd c: But professor d: That 's So so i @ @ I think the issue is , \" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? \" phd a: Right . professor d: If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking , phd c: Yeah . phd a: So it 's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is . professor d: Yeah , is there a narrow Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern ? So if there 's a distributed beam pattern , then it looks more like it 's it 's  , multiple people . OK , it just it just seemed to me that  , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .  , I I think it 's I can see the value o professor d: Oh , ideal would be to have the wall filled with them , but  But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page , it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different .",
        " phd a: Did - Sorry , b  I 'm not sure what Dan 's page is that you mean . professor d: You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags . So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag . professor d: So if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function . phd a: So so if there 's two grad b: And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks . postdoc e: Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ? phd c: Yeah . The - the Oh , I 'm sorry , postdoc e: No ? professor d: if they 're right next to one another ? phd a: If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work . professor d: i i postdoc e: Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA . postdoc e: Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one . grad b: Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either . Yeah , so it 's postdoc e: And so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially differentially varia valuable . postdoc e: it 's not to say  , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . professor d: But it 's almost but it 's almost a I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . professor d: There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error  issue . professor d: If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it . and i and if there So it And if it 's the two of you guys on the same side professor d: if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . professor d: So if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , experience with it to know how postdoc e: Yeah . postdoc e: Oh I 'm not I 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . I just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . professor d: the other thing you can do  , if  , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA . And then you know then you 're sort of Yeah , then then you pretty much could cover phd a: Once you got two postdoc e: Interesting . phd a: Well what about just doing it from these mikes ? postdoc e: Interesting . phd c: It will be more interesting to study the PZM because the the the separation I I think professor d:  @ @ But - but that 's  , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . professor d: But but but the thing is , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA . phd a: That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ? phd c: Yeah . professor d: Well , that 's that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in . professor d: but you know if you can instrument a room , this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing , right ? Some people at at  , yeah , at Brown and and and and at   and at Cape , grad b: Big micro @ @ arrays . phd a: Didn't they have something at Cape ? professor d: they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place grad b: Very finely . professor d: you know p tens of microphones , and and  phd a: Oh ! I saw a demo . professor d: And if you do that then you can really get very nice  kind of selectivity phd a: Yeah . grad b: Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array . phd a: And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody . grad b: It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it . professor d: But , the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because  , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . And you can't just always go , \" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up \" . phd a: No , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . phd a: It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA . grad b: But I think professor d: The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D grad b: Yep . professor d: and they communicate with each other ? And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that  , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two . grad b: Though All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , postdoc e: Interesting . grad b: not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of  multi - band as well . postdoc e: Ah ! phd a: I still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then grad b: But I think postdoc e: Well , you could have strips that you stick to your clothing . phd a: Hats ? grad b: In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .  , I i I i I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , birthdays thing there . professor d: So grad b: Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . grad b: One is , do we need to sign new these again ? postdoc e: Well , it 's slightly different . phd a: Are they new ? postdoc e: Cuz it it 's slightly different . professor d: Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to . grad b: Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed . grad b: I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing . postdoc e: I had to make one grad b: But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . postdoc e: Well , should I  I have some results to present , but  I guess we won't have time to do that this time . But it seems like  the anonymization is  , is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .  , wha what postdoc e: If if we 're about to wind down , I think what I would prefer is that we  , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present the results that I have on the overlaps . @ @ It sounds like u  , there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . Why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them , and then and then and then and then and then we grad b: OK , go ahead , Jane . postdoc e: I 'd Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . postdoc e: And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . postdoc e: I really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and I have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and I think we should grad b: Alright . We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e: Well , OK . I I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes . postdoc e: OK , so the the short thing is  , we have  , tape recording  , sorry , digitized recor recordings . postdoc e: Now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says \" Hey Roger \" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? grad b: No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping . postdoc e: OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned . Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we don't want postdoc e: I I don't think you understood what I what I said . postdoc e: So  , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says \" So , Roger , what do you think ? \" OK . Then , it seems to me that Well , maybe I  it seems to me that if you change the name , the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that . grad b: We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be \" Roger \" . grad b: Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that . postdoc e: OK , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have \" Roger \" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was \" Roger \" be \" Frank \" , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . postdoc e: Now , if you want to , you know , in some cases , I I I know that Susan Ervin - Tripp in some of hers , actually did do  , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except professor d: Yeah Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . postdoc e: And and I cer and I So , the question then becomes one level back .  , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? Well , on the one hand , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions ,  and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK . On the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . postdoc e: So , is it really ,  You know ? grad b: Ugh ! postdoc e: Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . And someone who looked professor d: You can go , you know , \" Z \"  , for instance .  , yeah , t it doesn't  , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in in the in the transcript . postdoc e: Yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say \" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings \" . So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , \" Frank said this \" and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's \" Frank colon \" . grad b: Yeah , shoot ! professor d: Right ? postdoc e: Yeah , and and you know , even more i i  , immediate than that just being able to ,  Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . postdoc e: S i You know , \" You raised the point , So - and - so \" , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who \" you \" was . postdoc e: And ac and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d: Yeah , I was too . Well , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . Well , I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript , phd c: Yeah . grad b: but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point . L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , what we 're covering in the meeting .  I realize when you 're doing this that   , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . So I think what would be helpful would be  , i and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too , that  , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , agenda items that they were interested in and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them  , into into the agenda , postdoc e: OK . I 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then I 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and  , and i ye yeah , I I 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to  , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's  , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b: How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? Do you know what I 'm saying ? phd a: \" The person who 's doing the transcript \" The IBM people ? grad b: Yeah .  , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ? postdoc e: How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b: so if I 'm saying in a meeting , \" oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so \" , postdoc e: How do you mean ? phd a: They 're just gonna write \" Bob \" on it or do @ @ grad b: if you 're doing Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write \" Bob \" . If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis , postdoc e: They won't be able to change it themselves . professor d: What ar how are they gonna do any of this ? grad b: Yeah , really . postdoc e: Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them . professor d: they 're gonna say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker  I I phd a: They can't do that . phd c: Yeah , I think grad b: Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity . phd c:  grad b: because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person . I think that My understanding from Yen Is it Yen - Ching ? Is that how you pronounce her name ? professor d:  Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . postdoc e: Oh ,  Yu - Ching ? Yu - Ching ? grad b: y Yu - Ching . postdoc e: was that  , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed , where they put speaker identifier down . But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them So they 'll do something like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . professor d: And it and it may very well be  , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . professor d: And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . grad b: Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes . phd c:  postdoc e: Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes . grad b: The p It 's a good point , \" which what do you do for discourse tracking ? \" phd c: Because y y you don't know to know , eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers . If if if if someone says , \" what what is Jose doing ? \" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding . postdoc e: Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit . You know ?  , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , @ @  , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . postdoc e: But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . phd a: But , you know , like , at the beginning of this meeting Or , you I think said , you know , or s Liz , said something about  , \" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? \"  , how would you say that ? postdoc e: Yeah ? phd a: you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef grad b: if you wanted to anonymize . Yeah , is professor d: \" Is you know who up in you know where ? \" phd a: Yeah . professor d: Right ? Use the phd a: I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names , plus we 'd have to tell everybody else . grad b: Yeah , darn !  , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . phd a: I I think the I think I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . grad b: Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse . grad b: Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to . phd a: I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker - one , speaker - two grad b: Sure but , h then you have to know that Jose is speaker - one and phd a: Why do you have to know his name ? professor d: OK , so suppose someone says , \" well I don't know if I really heard what  , what Jose said . professor d: So  u phd a: Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word \" Jose \" in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded . professor d: And so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says \" speaker - five \" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose , grad b: And that violates our privacy . professor d: and if were gonna do that we might as well give them \" Jose \" say it was \" Jose \" . postdoc e: Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI . postdoc e: And within that , it may be that it 's sufficient to not  change the to not incorporate anonymization yet , but always , always in the publications we have to . postdoc e: And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . But I but I don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how grad b: Making some decisions ? postdoc e: i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the  the audio , and just put in brackets \" speaker - one \" . phd c: the ? ? grad b: You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . professor d: I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and postdoc e: But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important . phd a: Well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any  For example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . phd a: If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know grad b: Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to still have it useful . grad b: But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names . professor d: She No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said \" Jose \" in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said \" Jose \" that you could replace it with \" speaker - seven \" . But I I also wanna say that people grad b: And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore . professor d: And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , postdoc e: Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated . postdoc e: But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time . grad b: I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is . postdoc e: Well it Discourse , you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript . postdoc e: It 's gonna be looking at a t You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this confronting this problem . phd a: Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , postdoc e: So . professor d: maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name . grad b: Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ? postdoc e: We could have little labels . I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like \" Mister White \" , \" Mister Pink \" , \" Mister Blue \" . Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? They were di they they had the utterances . phd a: But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous grad b: Everything was in the same order , but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards . phd a: What did it sound like ? grad b: People had no difficulty in interpreting it . So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it . professor d: What , what does the speech recognizer care ? grad b: Ah , anyway . professor d: postdoc e: Oh , do we do digits ? Or ? What do we do ? grad b:  OK , we 'll quickly do digits . like as if you were talking like , \" nine eight six eight seven ? \" postdoc e: Well , you know , in the in the one I transcribed , I did find a couple instances I found one instance of contrastive stress , where it was like the string had a li So it was like \" nine eight two four , nine nine two four \" . So they were like looking ahead , postdoc e: And phd a: huh ? postdoc e: Well , they differed .  , I 've I am sort of interested in in And sometimes , you know , I s And I I never know . phd a: Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this postdoc e: and I phd a: They may as well throw in some interesting intonations "

        "project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach "

        "Item 2 this morning is the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill: Stage 2 proceedings. I'm pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government; and Emma Gammon, lawyer for Welsh Government. As I said, the purpose of the meeting is to undertake Stage 2 proceedings on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. For these proceedings, Members should have copies of the marshalled list of amendments, the groupings of the amendments for debate and the voting order for the amendments. The marshalled list of amendments is the list of all amendments tabled, marshalled into the order in which the sections appear in the Bill. The order in which we consider amendments will be the default order\u2014that is, sections 1 to 3 and the long title. However, the order in which they're called and moved for decision is dictated by the marshalled list. Members will, therefore, need to follow the two papers, although I will advise Members when I call them whether they're being called to speak in the debate or to move their amendments for a decision. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair I will move amendments in the name of the Deputy Minister. For expediency, I will assume that the Deputy Minister wishes me to move all of her amendments, and I will do so at the appropriate place in the marshalled list. Deputy Minister, if you do not want a particular amendment to be moved, please indicate to me at the relevant point in proceedings. In line with our usual practice, legal advisers to the committee and the Deputy Minister are not expected to provide advice on the record. If Members wish to seek legal advice during proceedings, please do so by passing a note to the legal adviser and, if necessary, we can adjourn. So, we will proceed, then, to group 1, which is the duty to promote public awareness. I move amendment 1 in the Deputy Minister's name and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendment and the other amendments in this group. My amendments 1 and 4 will place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. I tabled these amendments in response to this committee's recommendation\u2014this was a recommendation from this committee in the Stage 1 report, so I have responded to that. I've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from Royal Assent, should the Bill be passed. I've considered amendments 1A to 1E, which have been tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders, and which relate to the duty to raise awareness. We don't think, actually, that this adds anything to the Government amendment, which already mentions awareness. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive, well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change, and understand how to respond to it. But I don't think it's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups, such as visitors to Wales, on the face of the Bill\u2014that's the approach taken in amendment 1E\u2014as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others. In relation to children, the committee will know that I'm fully committed to children\u2019s rights, and that Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions. An additional due regard requirement, such as the one set out in amendment 1D, relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed. This would be part and parcel of the Welsh Government approach to putting children\u2019s rights at the heart of our policy making. Similarly, I don't think it's necessary for the Bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, as is suggested in amendments 1B and 1C. Information required about parenting support will be considered by the parenting expert group, under the auspices of the Bill\u2019s strategic implementation group, working with my officials and the expert stakeholder group on the awareness-raising campaign. And, really, their thinking should not be constrained in any way by specifications on the face of the Bill. I think we always need to bear in mind that what the Bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence; it does not create a new offence. And in this context, it doesn't make sense for this Bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished. As I set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point, safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business, and, as now, the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, and I ask Members to reject amendments 1A to 1E because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the Bill. I wish to speak to amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness. While we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law, the Deputy Minister's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at Stage 1. An important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that I've tabled within this group\u2014that of a sustained awareness campaign, which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the Bill, but serves as a duty for future administrations. Amendment 1A: primarily, amendment 1A changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law. I don't think it's enough for the Welsh Government to say that the public should be made aware of the coming into force of section 1 and that a public awareness campaign needs to be sustained until the Welsh Government's objectives have been achieved. Despite the fact that it is intended to change behaviour, the consequences of this law are far greater than that of organ donation or prohibiting smoking indoors. Instead of an opt-out system or a civil offence, this law will remove a defence for parents, information on which could be there on their records for the rest of their lives, potentially separate parents, and could affect employment chances. As such, whilst we agree with the necessity of the awareness campaign, it is important too that the Welsh Government take stock and ensures that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. The witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands\u2014 lynne neagle am: Janet, Dawn is asking if you'll take an intervention. dawn bowden am: I just wanted to know\u2014could you give us examples of any other piece of legislation where there's been indefinite public awareness campaigns once it's been passed? janet finch-saunders am: There's a lot of legislation. The first Assembly term when I was here\u2014 dawn bowden am: Yes, what I'm asking\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: I'm trying to respond\u2014 dawn bowden am: What I'm asking for is: can you give us specific examples of where there have been indefinite public awareness campaigns running indefinitely past the enactment of a piece of legislation? janet finch-saunders am: The very first term that I was an Assembly Member, we passed 25 pieces of separate legislation. Even today, as I sit here, the public are not aware of many of those pieces of legislation. So, therefore, I think there is a necessity for both children and parents to become involved, and I shall speak now\u2014 dawn bowden am: With respect, Chair, that's not the question I asked. lynne neagle am: I can call you in the debate, if you'd like to make a more substantive contribution on this. janet finch-saunders am: The witnesses who we heard from before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands the implications. And that's what we're talking about here, Members\u2014the implications of removing this defence. Strikingly, the Office of Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent stated the following: 'the potential for public resistance to the Bill through misunderstanding or confusion over it implications may pose the largest barrier to its implementation.' If you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment, it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this Bill. Additionally, the committee found that while the current Welsh Government's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt, future Governments may have less of a commitment. This places further weight on the fact that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the Bill beyond its commencement. Furthermore, the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill quite clearly notes that, under section 2, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister can respond as to the reasons why the Welsh Government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment. [Interruption.] Should our amendment be agreed\u2014 lynne neagle am: Are you taking an intervention? janet finch-saunders am: No. janet finch-saunders am: Should our amendment to be agreed, we also request that a printing change be made to ensure that the new heading reflects promoting awareness of the changes to the law made by section 1. Amendment 1B: amendment 1B is in line with the committee's recommendation 9, which stated that, as part of a public awareness campaign, there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when disciplining their children. During evidence at Stage 1, the witnesses we saw before the committee raised serious concerns about harder-to-reach groups who needed to be made aware of removing the defence. For example, Children in Wales, Action for Children and Play Wales stated that some families and communities may be harder to reach with information and support. Now, while the Deputy Minister states that she would work hard to ensure that harder-to-reach groups receive this information, a duty to provide information on alternatives to physical punishment would ensure that future Welsh Governments would maintain a successful awareness-raising campaign. I note the Deputy Minister accepted the recommendation, through our amendment, but this does not explicitly include a duty to provide details about support for parents. As will be expanded upon later, the Deputy Minister has relied upon the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign to be delivered alongside awareness raising. However, this is only an online resource and she must be clear about what other avenues will be available to parents who do not have access to the internet or are part of harder-to-reach groups. Amendment 1C: amendment 1C supports the committee's recommendation 15 that explains that the Welsh Government should ensure clear advice is provided on what people can do if they have seen or learned of a child being physically assaulted. We urged, at Stage 1, that although many professionals were already under a duty to report concerns about physical punishment, regardless of the Bill, other witnesses raised concerns that it could create the potential for claims of abuse that are unfounded. In particular, some were worried that children, who may not realise the implications of reporting, could make allegations that are actually untrue. While we would expect the awareness-raising campaign to include the consequences of false accusations, this could also be reflected among adults, if the public are not sufficiently made aware of how they can report and in what situations they can report a case of assault. I think it's worth just pointing out at this stage that the majority of the amendments that are being made and articulated by Janet there are based on committee recommendations, and those recommendations were made after taking evidence from the public at large, but also you as well. So, that suggests that, at that stage, we weren't reassured by the offer that you were making because we felt the need to put these recommendations into our report. Now, I recognise that you've moved some way on some of these amendments, and we'll been talking about that through the course of the debates on other groups. But the one thing to bear in mind here is this is legislation, now\u2014that means that this is the instrument of the Assembly, not of Government, and if this Assembly feels that the face of the Bill is unclear on the minimum requirements of a public awareness campaign, then we have the right to suggest the things that we would like to see in that public awareness-raising campaign. The reason these have been tabled individually and independently is that some may be acceptable where others may not be, so it will be disappointing to hear that you're rejecting them all, and the reason they need to go on the face of the Bill is that, if you are going to introduce specifics via regulation, at the moment we have no reassurance about how you're going to do that\u2014about what input the Assembly, on behalf of our constituents, could have in designing that public awareness-raising campaign. Unless you accept some amendments in other groups, that is the position with this Bill: the influence of the Assembly will be zero over the content of an awareness-raising campaign. In terms of it being non-time limited, I think the amendment has been tabled in the way it has not to oblige you to an everlasting, never-ending campaign of awareness raising. But if you bear in mind that, seven years after the introduction of this Bill, there's going to be some reporting on the effectiveness of the Bill, what is the point of doing that if you don't then have an obligation, should the reports require it to be necessary, to continue promoting the changes in the law? I accept that that can't go on for centuries, but to actually limit it to two years on an issue that is so sensitive, and which has a reach beyond our boundaries, I think is genuinely a mistake. I think that's true, but I think Janet Finch-Saunders was right to say that members of the public, ordinary individuals, not professionals, will need assurance that they're doing the right thing. The amendment as listed is not even there to encourage people to do that, although that can be read in that way, but it is to help them be certain that they are doing the right thing. If this is going to be up to the individual, as you've said, and the committee itself wasn't reassured that individuals would know what to do, perhaps I can ask you to consider at Stage 3, if you're going to reject this amendment, how you can reassure members of the public that, if they are going to intervene on the back of this law, they're making things better, not worse. dawn bowden am: My comments, really, relate to ongoing awareness-raising campaigns, which I think all of us would want to see, and would appreciate in any changes in legislation. My point, really, is that we have a plethora of legislation that this Assembly has passed in the last 20 years, and I'm not aware of any legislation where, on the face of the Bill we have ongoing awareness-raising campaigns on an indefinite basis. It seems to me that, for some reason, you seem to be wanting to take a completely different approach to this piece of legislation. From what the Deputy Minister is saying\u2014and perhaps I will get some clarity on this\u2014there will be an amendment to the legislation that will say that we have an awareness campaign. That awareness campaign can be the subject of consultation with interested parties in terms of what needs to be included in it. It could also, I assume, Deputy Minister, be an awareness campaign that can be written into a set of guidance for future use. But the point I'm trying to make is that I don't believe that any piece of legislation requires ongoing and indefinite awareness-raising campaigns, and particularly in relation to visitors to Wales. Again, we have other pieces of legislation in Wales that are not applicable in the other parts of the UK. I am not aware that there is a necessity for awareness-raising campaigns with visitors coming into Wales on the raft of the other pieces of legislation that we have that they don't. And similarly, when we go to visit countries that have different legislation, we don't necessarily know what legislation we're going into when we visit that country\u2014you just go there and you accept that you go to a different country and you abide by their laws. So, my key point, Chair, is just the necessity of an ongoing, endless awareness campaign being written onto the face of the Bill. hefin david am: My comments follow logically from Dawn Bowden's comments, particularly in relation to amendments 1D and 1E. What you would be doing is that this Senedd, if this was on the face of the Bill, the duty on Ministers, would be putting the duty on Ministers in law beyond the life of the fifth Senedd, into the next Senedd term, and putting that duty on those newly elected Ministers after that, which, in principle, would be against the principles of binding\u2014 lynne neagle am: Hefin, are you taking an intervention from Suzy? hefin david am: Yes, happy to. hefin david am: I'm happy to take it now, because I was going to sum up by agreeing with the point you made, actually. You referred to this potentially binding Ministers in future Assemblies; at the moment, we've got an implementation period and a five-year reporting period that takes any reporting on this Act into the Assembly after next. I'm wondering if you're going to have any comments on that when we come to the amendment to change that later on. hefin david am: Well, when we get to that amendment, I'll make comments if I feel it necessary. But at this point in time, we're talking about amendments 1D and 1E, and particularly in relation to 1D and 1E it just isn't necessary, given the fact that\u2014I won't call it a concession, because I think you made a reasonable point about the Minister making a statement at Stage 3, and I think Dawn Bowden actually supported that as well. And that's my key point, really, which is why I wouldn't vote for those two amendments. I don't believe that there is a need for an indefinite campaign, as is outlined in 1A. I agree entirely that there is a need for a campaign during the period of change, and therefore I'm very glad to see that the Government has brought forward amendment 1, and I do hope that there will be a real push during the period of change. In terms of amendment 1B, I do have sympathy with what is being said here, but I believe that any kind of information or campaign in terms of enabling parents to learn about alternatives to physical punishment should be the subject of continual far-reaching work by the Government, through various programmes, and it should not be an addition on the face of this Bill, which deals with a small change to the common law. And then, on 1D also, if I may\u2014I don't agree with this either. Again, I believe that there is a need to promote awareness amongst children, but that should happen through the children's rights convention, as part of a broader programme to promote children's rights. julie morgan am: Thank you all very much for your contributions to the debate and your comments on these amendments today. I just want to re-emphasise that it is as a result of the recommendation from this committee that we are putting this duty to have the awareness campaign on the face of the Bill,\u00a0and I absolutely recognise the crucial role awareness raising has to play in supporting the implementation of the Bill. I'm very grateful for and appreciate the committee's interest and the work that you've done in this area of work. We're committed to a high-intensity awareness over six years from Royal Assent, and there is an expert stakeholder group supporting us with the development of the awareness campaign. Would you just take an intervention on that just to help me understand? A two-year awareness-raising campaign\u2014how have you concluded that\u2014 julie morgan am: Six-year. suzy davies am: Oh, so it is going to continue beyond section 1 coming into force\u2014 julie morgan am: Yes. Amendment 1B, about support available to parents and how to access it\u2014again, this level of detail is not required on the face of the Bill. I just want to emphasise we have got this expert implementation group, who are working on all aspects of this Bill, many of whom represent organisations who gave evidence to this committee. I think lots of these amendments are very helpful and interesting, but would be discussed and would be acted on in the normal pathway of planning and development, and they're not required on the face of the Bill. So, I'm not putting them down, I'm just saying that we don't need them to be there on the face of the Bill. And then amendment 1C\u2014the information about how to raise concerns\u2014I do repeat that safeguarding is everybody's business, and the same issues apply now as will after this defence has been removed. Amendment 1D\u2014Ministers to have regard to the need to promote awareness among children\u2014now, children's rights are absolutely enshrined in our policy making, and the entire Bill is about protecting the rights of children. Again, in terms of visitors, the level of detail is simply not required on the face of the Bill. And then to pick up a few of the other points that were raised, revisions to the impact assessments are being considered as part of my commitment to update the explanatory memorandum ahead of Stage 3. The issue that was raised about the Scottish Bill, that it refers to 'understanding'\u2014now, the Scottish Bill was not a Government Bill, it was a private Member's Bill, and our view is that nothing is added by adding the 'understanding'; 'awareness' is sufficient. So, basically, I think that the points made have been very useful, but I urge committee members to accept my amendments, but to reject those proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders, as they are unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needs to achieve. Does any\u00a0Member object? [Objection.]\u00a0Okay, I'll take a vote by show of hands.\u00a0All those in favour of amendment 1B.\u00a0All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, as there's an objection, I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 1? julie morgan am: I do. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, we have an objection, so we'll take a vote by show of hands. We'll move on now then to group 2, which relates to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation. I move amendment 2 in the Deputy Minister's name, and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments, and the other amendments in this group.",
        " The amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the Bill, and I believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee, so you strongly influenced this amendment. It's clear from Members' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at Stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment. I've already provided assurance that I agree with the importance placed on such a review, both in the explanatory memorandum and during Stage 1 scrutiny. I also made a commitment to bring forward a Government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the Bill. As I said in my responses to the Stage 1 committee report, and as set out in the explanatory memorandum, the post-implementation review of this Bill will not be a single piece of work, but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1. Firstly, we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys, which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment. Secondly, through a dedicated task and finish group, we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the Bill and to consider the possible impact on services. Turning to amendment 2C, this amendment would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced. This amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what I think is a priority for the implementation of this Bill: that is, given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders. I also think this amendment is not required because, as I've already stated, we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising. In June, I shared the findings of a representative survey, which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation. I speak to amendments 2C, excluding 2D, to 2K, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment. Again, I must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment. Amendments 2E to 2K outline what we would expect to be within this report, and we would wish to see a commitment from the Deputy Minister to ensure the National Assembly for Wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report. Amendment 2C requests that the Welsh Government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign and lays it before the Assembly before section 1 commences. As I have outlined under my amendments in group 1, the understanding of the public about the implications of the Bill cannot be sidelined. Although the Deputy Minister has repeated her commitment to a public awareness campaign, we, as the National Assembly for Wales, must be able to scrutinise its effectiveness before section 1 begins. As I noted under amendments 1B to 1E, there are specific groups of people who need to be evaluated on their understanding of the Bill's effect. I'm sure that the Deputy Minister will agree that the harder-to-reach groups are undoubtedly the most vulnerable to any negative impacts that the Bill will have because of the greater potential of a lack of awareness. It is, therefore, important for the Assembly to be able to determine whether the awareness-raising campaign has had a positive effect on these groups of people. As will also be elaborated under amendment 2D, it is extremely important that we, as the Parliament of Wales, are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign's impact. Before we implement what will be a criminal offence, it is vital that we ensure that those affected are not adversely impacted because of a poorly targeted awareness campaign. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister would commit to an independent evaluation of the awareness campaign's effects before section 1 commences. Deputy Minister, first of all, can I just say thank you for your opening remarks about the possibility of perhaps doing some work around amendment 2B? I'll come to that a little bit later, if I may. I just want to begin by commenting briefly on what you said about why you'll be rejecting amendment 2C here. I actually don't think that this amendment should affect or jeopardise the commencement date in any way at all. It's an operational requirement to get this work done before the commencement date that's in the draft Bill at the moment. So, failing to meet that would be as a result of operations not going well, rather than anything intrinsic in the Bill, so I'm not sure I can accept your argument on that. And, on 2D\u2014very pleased to hear that you'd be willing to introduce something about 'laying' rather than 'publishing' at Stage 3, but, in the spirit of recognising that this is the legislature, perhaps I could encourage you just to accept the amendment at this stage, because it doesn't make any difference. Your amendment is going to pass, and this amendment to it would be\u2014I think the gesture there would be very much appreciated. I'll be speaking mainly to amendments 2A and 2B, but I want to begin, again, by thanking you for moving some way on this and considering amendments to the Bill on the issue of reporting, because I know you were keen to avoid amendments in the name of simplicity; you mentioned it earlier. But this is not a newid bychan, I'm afraid, Si\u00e2n; the terms and the effect of this Bill are quite extensive, and it does need the reassurances, if you like, necessary to mitigate potentially disproportionate effects of this Bill on families where parents' actions had been lawful up until this point in statute. I know that you're sincere that you want this duty to report to show that the Bill is effective in stopping smacking as a punishment, and also that it is not as harmful to parents as perhaps some of us fear. But, if this were me bringing forward this Bill, I think I'd want to show the world that I was doing the right thing a lot sooner than you appear to wish to do. Amendment 2 means that the efficacy of the Bill will not formally be assessed until seven years after it has passed. If you're relying on the two-year period before section 1 comes into operation to do much of the heavy lifting on the culture change, and I think that is what you're expecting\u2014you know, showing a reduction in the incidence of physical punishment, reducing the number of, and indeed the likelihood of, parents putting themselves in the path of criminal liability once those two years are up\u2014I really would have thought you'd want people to know sooner, or as soon as the first possible opportunity on that. Waiting five years, I think, will diminish the ability of you to prove the efficacy of those initial two years, and this is why I'm grateful to you for your offer, because there may be a way where we can overcome that. If the trend of culture change is continuing after year 3\u2014so, basically, in the first year after section 1 comes into effect\u2014that's great, but there's a possibility it's going to reverse. For myself, I think one year would probably be enough, but I think three years is a reasonable compromise, as opposed to five years, for a reporting period. I can't see the reason for quite that length of time\u2014I know you've talked about New Zealand\u2014but neither can the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee. When they took the step of recommending this duty to evaluate and report, they also took the step of suggesting a three-year reporting period being more in keeping with other post-legislative scrutiny. That's something I think we perhaps need to bear in mind now, as we enter this period of the consolidation of law. Five/seven years is really something of an outlier, and while that might have been appropriate, perhaps, in New Zealand, I don't think that fits in with our timetables generally here in Wales, and, of course, there are other countries that have introduced this over a period of years, and I note that you haven't drawn on them in order to support your argument. So, can I urge Members and the Minister to consider the arguments behind these amendments? I don't think it's going to reassure anyone\u2014you may want to intervene at this point, Hefin\u2014that we not only won't hear in this Assembly, we won't hear in the next Assembly, about the formal evaluation of this, unless I follow\u2014 hefin david am: I won't intervene; I'll speak. suzy davies am: Is that okay? hefin david am: Yes, I'll make the point. lynne neagle am: Okay, I've got\u2014 suzy davies am: Yes, I'll take the intervention. lynne neagle am: No,\u00a0he doesn't want to make an intervention\u2014 hefin david am: I won't do an intervention; I'll speak. suzy davies am: Oh, apologies\u2014 hefin david am: Just to say\u2014 suzy davies am: I'll wait. The point I was making about 1D and 1E is they close down choices to Ministers in future Assemblies. An evaluative practice would actually open up those choices and give future Parliaments more options with regard to this Bill, so I think it's entirely consistent. I don't think the Minister, in putting in amendment 2, was trying to undermine my argument. Actually, I think she's being constructive by doing that, and I think amendment 2 is a practical amendment that's quite helpful, and its consequence will be to open up choices to future Parliaments, whereas my objection to 1D and 1E is they close those down. suzy davies am: Okay, well, as I say, I think, actually,\u00a0the Deputy Minister's offer of a three-year interim period might be part of a resolution to this. Because I'm not 100 per cent sure I accept your argument, either, because it closes it down for the interim period if we don't move on with the Deputy Minister's suggestion\u2014which I'll talk about now, actually. But I need some clarity on what you would allow this Assembly to do in helping define the terms of that interim report. Because you've been very clear that you don't want to accept the things that Janet Finch-Saunders has been talking about in a final report, and yet I can tell you we want to hear about these things. So, if you're in a position where you can give a commitment at Stage 3 not only to introduce an interim report, but that you will consult with, perhaps, this committee\u2014I'll leave it to you\u2014on the contents of that interim report, what we would want to see tested, then I'll be minded not to move amendment 2B. If you can't give me that reassurance, then I'm going to move it anyway and we'll return to it at Stage 3, if you don't mind. Just a final point on this issue of reporting within three months rather than as soon as practicable, and I do take your point that there may be a misalignment with reporting periods from the organisations you hope to talk to. Again, at Stage 3, I'm happy if you want to make three months six months, or something like that, but 'as soon as practicable' is open ended, and what you think is practicable may be very different from what I or my constituents think is practicable. So, I don't want to stick with what is practicable; I would like you to put a date on this. If it's a case that you think six months is long enough for data gathering and reporting from third parties, I think that's fairly reasonable as well, but I'm not minded to allow you to just keep this open ended. sian gwenllian am: Yes, I welcome adding to the Bill through amendment 2, and what you've said today also, that you're willing to provide an interim report and bring an amendment forward to allow that through the Bill, and to lay a report before the Assembly. I am interested in what Suzy is saying, and have a lot of sympathy with trying to tie it down to specific time periods, and not say 'when it will be practicable'. Therefore, I would encourage you not to move your amendments if you have the confirmation that you want to hear this morning from the Minister regarding these issues. julie morgan am: Well, just to start off on that point, I think your suggestion about how we consult and discuss, I think I'm very happy to accept that. So, I'm happy to discuss that with you, and with the committee, before the third Stage. Well, just to go on to cover some of the points that have been raised, on the issue of training now, I think Janet raised a number of points about training, and we do have an operations, procedures, processes and training task and finish group as part of our implementation work, and they are considering guidance and training requirements. There are many professional bodies represented on that group, many of whom I think have given evidence here today, and they've really got a chance to have their say. The officials are also looking at training as part of the revision of the explanatory memorandum at Stage 3, so there will be more information about training there. Generally, I think that all the contributions are very helpful, and I know they're meant in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation. I can't support amendments 2A, 2C, and amendments 2E to 2K, because these amendments make little difference in terms of practical effect to what we have in the Bill already, or they're covered by the Government amendments that I've moved. But I do hope the committee is reassured that we are committed to undertaking a very thorough, multifaceted review of the impact of the legislation that includes tracking public attitudes and considering impacts on\u00a0public services. Now, tracking the public attitudes will be going along at regular points, so there's no question there of having to wait; we'll be having regular reporting of public attitudes. Of course, I appreciate that you will not be supporting these amendments, but can you give us some indication of how many of the areas of interest to us you will be reporting on? So, even if this is not a statutory commitment, what exactly from our list, our wish list here, would you be prepared to include in your evaluation? julie morgan am: Well, I would actually have thought all of them. Obviously, this is not a statutory thing I'm saying, but\u2014 suzy davies am: No, no, and this is not a\u2014 julie morgan am: Yes, but considering those points you've put forward, I think all of them have got a great deal of relevance. We will certainly be reporting to the group to consider any of the ideas that you've suggested and, in particular with the data collection and the monitoring task and finish group, which is about developing methods to collect data, we will be putting forward some of the suggestions that you've made on those issues. I'm hopeful you may withdraw the two amendments\u2014I think one of yours and it was one of Janet's, wasn't it\u2014so that we could work together on those before the next stage. Because I am sympathetic to your views on these matters, and I think they do reflect some of the discussions in the committee as well. In line with the recommendations of the Finance Committee, further details of the costs associated with the post-implementation review will be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment at Stage 3. So, I think at this point I would ask that Members reject the non-Government amendments and agree to my amendments 2 and 5, which will ultimately achieve the same policy aim without the need for unnecessary detail on the Bill, with the exception, obviously, of those two amendments, which I'm prepared to look at a way of moving forward on. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote by show of hands. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 2A? suzy davies am: I move amendment 2A, yes. lynne neagle am: Janet, do you wish to move amendment 2E? janet finch-saunders am: I move. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so can I see all those in favour of amendment 2F? All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, can I see all those in favour of amendment 2G? All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so can I see all those in favour of amendment 2H? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Can I see all those in favour of 2J? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] I'll therefore take a vote by show of hands. All those in favour of amendment 2K? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 2B? suzy davies am: In view of the Deputy Minister's reassurances, I won't move this amendment today, but obviously I reserve the right to bring something back if we can't reach consensus. lynne neagle am: Does any other Member wish to move amendment 2B? Okay, no. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 2? julie morgan am: I do. I move amendment 3 in the Deputy Minister's name and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments and the other amendments in this group. Members will note that I've brought forward an amendment to provide certainty on the date of commencement of the core provision in the Bill, which is obviously to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment. So, we're obviously debating that after we deal with these particular technical issues\u2014these are technical issues here, basically. As a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a Welsh Minister to make an Order for commencement, the power to make transitory, transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the Bill coming into force would also be removed. So, I'm not seeking here to add any new powers to the Bill; amendment 3 will simply add this existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent. In fact, removing the power for the Welsh Ministers to commence the provision in section 1 by Order means the statutory instrument will actually do less than originally intended. These amendments are technical in nature and while I acknowledge that the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied, their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied. The absence of an Assembly procedure does not mean that Ministers' decisions in relation to transitional powers cannot be scrutinised by the Assembly. This was a point made to CLAC and, as I say, their final conclusion was that no procedure is the appropriate procedure for such a power. Well perhaps, Deputy Minister, I can begin by saying that one person's technical issue is another person's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny. But I thank you for noting the Assembly's observations on the ministerial powers granted in this Bill\u2014this time by CLAC, as you say. Moving this\u2014and I'm glad actually that amendment 8, I think it was, has removed an Order provision and we're moving into an area where at least statutory instruments do feature here. I have to say that amendment 3A is something of a probing amendment, and I'll explain why now. Your amendment 3 seeks to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1, but it's actually in a substantive part of section 1 itself now\u2014it's not a separate commencement power. And, actually, I've been listening to the rest of this debate, and thinking that, if you're going to be introducing an awareness campaign and a report, the chances are you're going to need some regulatory powers to introduce some of the aspects of both those policy areas, I think. And I'm wondering whether the\u2014what is it\u2014transitory, transitional and saving provisions are actually enough powers for you under the course of this Bill. I'm wondering whether you want to consider actually amending this to give yourself the more usual unrestricted power to make regulations in order for you to get section 1 implemented, bearing in mind that it has now been amended from that original, very short and simple\u2014or at least simple in terms of drafting\u2014initial draft. As I say, in anticipation of you rejecting amendments in group 1 I tabled this, in order to make sure that an opportunity remains for the Assembly to bring anything you may wish to introduce under section 1, when it comes into effect, onto the floor of the Assembly. Because while I completely accept that you've acknowledged that statutory instrument is the process for introducing things from now on, it's still possible to do that without procedure, and so I have no idea whether you think what you introduce would be better suited to be introduced by a negative or affirmative procedure. Amendment 3A is a holding position, which we will return to you in Stage 3, because I think, again, this is an area where it might be valuable for us to discuss quite what kind of powers you're looking for, because I think you probably need something that's beyond transitional, transitory and saving. lynne neagle am: Are there any other Members who wish to speak on this group? No. We don't actually think it's necessary to have wider powers, but we will keep this under review and at Stage 3, I think that\u2014. When I was looking at this, I was concerned to know what the transitory powers\u2014what we would actually need to do at that stage, but I can understand that there may be links to other Bills in ways that we are not anticipating at the moment that would make it necessary to have those powers. So, basically, I don't think it is necessary to have wider powers, but I can assure you that we'll keep that in review coming up to Stage 3. suzy davies am: Can I just ask a question on the back of that? lynne neagle am: Will you take a brief intervention at the end, Minister? suzy davies am: Will you take the briefest intervention before your full stop? julie morgan am: I was going to end there, yes. suzy davies am: Right, okay, well, just before your full stop, would you just confirm that you're happy for us to discuss this before Stage 3? julie morgan am: Yes, very happy. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 3A? suzy davies am: I'll move it, yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, I'll take a vote by show of hands. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 3? julie morgan am: I do. The committee will now break for 10 minutes and reconvene at 11.05 a.m. Can I welcome Members back? We will move on to group 4, which relates to the duty to ensure sufficient funding. As I outlined under amendments 2I and 2J, there are ongoing concerns about the potential costs for Welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment. Now, it was absolutely clear from evidence that we received in this committee that unknown costs would be challenging and potentially problematic. As I have mentioned previously, these concerns would doubtless be most keenly felt in our hard-pressed social services. Furthermore, the Welsh Local Government Association stated that there must be a commitment that whatever the costs are, those costs are met, because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales.",
        " Now, during evidence, the Deputy Minister, when asked about the reliance on a limited number of reporting of cases likely to happen and the potential for a degree of unknown costs stated: 'we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate.' But you couldn't commit to a broad figure, instead telling us that: 'we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us.' And: 'We have to measure it as we go along.' Given that devolved authorities need to plan their budgets for these changes, we only think it is fair for the Welsh Government to provide sufficient funding to alleviate the cost implications of this Bill. Now, while amendment 11 makes reference to costs borne by local authorities and health boards, I note that amendment 12 takes this further by including other devolved authorities that are not funded by Welsh Government. Anticipating the Deputy Minister's response that few under this category, if any at all, would be affected by the Bill, we are pursuing a principle here, and it is agreement to the principle of providing sufficient funding that we are seeking from you as the Deputy Minister. The Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013: last year, the Economy, Infrastructure and Skills Committee found that the Wales annual spend on walking and cycling is half that of England's and one sixth of Holland's. Furthermore, the committee highlighted that the passing of the Act put a requirement on local authorities to continuously improve active travel routes, but were constrained by the funding made available to them. Now, my local authority and other authorities that have done some monitoring on the active travel Act\u2014they simply were not awarded sufficient funding to actually allow the active travel Act to become a meaningful piece of legislation, and the same goes with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. This month, the auditor general has raised concerns that the public services boards created under the Act were limited in their work and impact due to the lack of dedicated funding. Outside of the Welsh Government's regional grant that cannot be spent on projects, councils often contribute through officer time or facilities, but resources and capacity to support those PSBs remain a key risk, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more. The reason that I wanted these amendments placed in here is I genuinely do not believe that you've even envisioned what, or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organisations, and certainly our local authorities and health boards, the impact this Bill is going to have. I can understand that the Member is concerned about the impact of this Bill on public services, but you will see from the explanatory memorandum and from the raft of impact statements published with the Bill that we've done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of this Bill before introduction. And as far as we're aware, no other country has done more than us to consider the impacts of similar legislation, and also comprehensively prepared for implementation. We've explored the published data, which is available from other countries, on the impact of measures they've taken to prohibit the physical punishment of children. We've also spoken to a range of stakeholders in Ireland, New Zealand and Malta, who have legal systems similar to our own. And stakeholders have been clear when giving evidence to this committee that they do not consider there will be runaway costs, and I think we should trust their judgment on this. In fact, as this committee notes in its Stage 1 report, those delivering services on the front line have said, without exception, that 'this Bill will improve their ability to protect children living in Wales because it will make the law clear.' Sally Jenkins of the Association of Directors of Social Services said to this committee: 'In terms of thresholds for children\u2019s services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. Jane Randall, chair of the National Independent Safeguarding Board Wales, said: 'there's no expectation that there's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals coming through to local authority social services, I think it would be dealt with within their existing resources.' And Dr Rowena Christmas, Royal College of General Practitioners, said: 'I can't see it's going to lengthen consultations. I can't see that it's going to increase the number of consultations, and I don't think it's going to increase the number of referrals I make to the health visitor or to social services, because if I was worried, I'd make those referrals now regardless of the Bill.' I just want to say again that the Bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault, which has formed part of the common law of England and Wales for a very long time. And social services already receive and investigate reports of children being assaulted, including from health and education, so it's not a whole new area of costly activity for any of them. As I've already pointed out when discussing group 2 amendments, we're working with organisations to put in place arrangements to collect data about the possible impact on their services, and this will be analysed as part of the post-implementation review of the legislation. Welsh Government can consider with relevant organisations how best to manage any impact on workloads or resources and any cost implications. I can assure you that work to update the regulatory impact assessment has continued, and I've asked officials to prepare a revised RIA, as recommended at Stage 2, and I expect to share an updated RIA with you in advance of Stage 3. Serious consideration is being given on how to provide more detailed estimates of the unknown costs to public services arising from the Bill, but I think you should be reassured by the evidence that was given, particularly to this committee, from the professionals at the front line. What the amendments are proposing is outside the normal funding arrangements that operate within Government, and it's not clear why, in the context of the evidence heard at Stage I, such provisions are necessary. I'm sure that Members will agree that future Governments need to be able to consider, within the context of the budget-setting process, what the priorities are, and these considerations would need to be made within the context at that time, for example taking into account any issues that there are\u2014UK Government actions, what happens in relation to Brexit, or any other unforeseen impacts on the economy or Welsh society. Furthermore, as is the case now, the National Assembly for Wales scrutinises the Welsh Government budget annually, so it would be able to make an argument for additional funding for public bodies, should it consider that this is required. I do think all the evidence has shown that we do not anticipate that there will be a huge increase of a demand for funding, so I urge Members to reject these amendments, which I believe are unnecessary. janet finch-saunders am: Chair, could I ask a question? lynne neagle am: You can reply to the debate now, Janet, yes. When we were taking evidence, at an earlier stage, I noticed that part of the stakeholder group\u2014there was some liaison going on with social services departments across Wales. What discussions have taken place with our local authorities in terms of their social services departments in terms of the lead, the cabinet members, or, indeed, the head of service? I can speak from my own experiences, when going around my constituency, but when I've spoken to some of the family support groups, and, indeed, the departments themselves, they are very concerned about the financial impact that this is going to have on the provision. They're already overstretched, and they see this as another burden\u2014primarily another financial burden. So, how much have you engaged with them? julie morgan am: There's been extensive engagement. We've had meetings with the Association of Directors of Social Services, and they're represented on all our groups, and we're working very closely with them, because, of course, they represent all the local authorities. But I have to say, when I've been going round and meeting lots of different groups, the first thing they say is, 'I'm so glad that you're doing this', and they haven't mentioned any financial implications. But, obviously, we will be very aware of\u2014we are looking at any more evidence that comes up. I was hoping to see some commitment to\u2014this Bill was going to go through, and it's one that could be implemented fully, because sufficient resources were there. Janet, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 12? janet finch-saunders am: I move. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 4? julie morgan am: Yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you want to proceed to a vote on amendment 5? julie morgan am: Yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you want to move to a vote on amendment 6? julie morgan am: Yes. lynne neagle am: I move amendment 6, then, in the name of the Deputy Minister. And I call Suzy Davies to move amendment 9 and to speak to the amendment and the other amendments in the group. Amendment 9 is actually consequential on amendment 10 passing, but it's the lead amendment in the group, so I'll move it to begin the debate. You've said repeatedly, and I believe you, that you do not wish to criminalise parents but just to stop them physically punishing their children. You could have chosen to try and achieve this through awareness raising and civil enforcement, but by choosing to remove the defence to a criminal act you have entered the arena of criminal law, where the logical consequence is opening parents up to liability\u2014not necessarily getting prosecuted, but liability to prosecution, not just liability to civil sanctions. I'm sure you'd prefer parents not to be prosecuted, but that decision does not and cannot lie with you. You, like us, have no agency in this, because the powers and the duties of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service sit outside our competence. You cannot and we cannot, by law or otherwise, instruct either of them in the delivery of your policy intention of not criminalising parents. You've acknowledged to this committee and the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee that revised CPS charging guidance and any other guidance on, for example, out-of-court disposals, are key to delivering your policy objectives. You'll remember how concerned this committee was when we learned that your advisory group\u2014the strategic implementation group, is it\u2014was only in the early stages of discussing what these guidelines might look like. So, you're actually asking us to pass law when we have no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children\u2014no control of the regard given to the relevance of force, the frequency of the offence, any prior conviction, any prior reporting, not even the views of the child in how they might be sentenced, or thresholds that would be appropriate for cautions and other out-of-court disposals; no guidance to the police on thresholds for arrest, let alone charging. And you argue that the rights of the child are what matter, and I agree with you here, but everybody, adult or child, has a right to natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, and you are in no position to offer us any comfort on these matters at this stage. I anticipate that that's unlikely, and I hope I'm wrong, but that's why Janet and I have tabled amendments 10 and 15, which prevent you bringing section 1 into force until that CPS guidance has been fully updated to take into account the change in the law and until pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed. That reflects our recommendation 4, this committee's recommendation, as well as CLAC's recommendation 1. It gives your strategic implementation board time to consider how it can get around the other fundamentally worrying issue of the effect of recording reports of apparent physical punishment, even if those reports ultimately prove unfounded. I have to say, Minister, I think these points are so serious that I would have liked to have tabled amendments preventing you seeking Royal Assent for this Bill until the Assembly has seen drafts of the range of official guidance needed for the police and CPS. I'd have sought a Report Stage, if I could, so that we could consider that evidence. But I'm therefore asking you to support the amendments we have tabled, 10 and 15, so that we can bring some damage limitation to a process that you ultimately cannot control once this Bill has passed. Now, I know you've got the numbers to pass this Bill, whether you accept amendments or not, but I just hope you can see the danger in pushing forward with a Bill that changes a person's relationship with the criminal law when you have no legal control over the consequences of that, and you're inviting this Assembly to fall into the same trap. Janet, do you want to speak? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I wish to speak to amendments 14 and 16. As was clear during the committee's evidence sessions, present Welsh Government support programmes for parents have insufficient coverage. For example, the capacity and reach of the Healthy Child Wales programme came under question on its role in awareness raising, with health representatives acknowledging that universality had not been achieved, with 53.2 per cent of children in Wales reported as being contacted. Furthermore, existing parenting support is often only available as part of a targeted programme in specific areas, such as Flying Start, and even the children's commissioner noted that much more is needed to support parents to find alternatives to disciplining their children. Now, the Deputy Minister mentioned the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign as part of proposals on a wider package of support for children and their parents. However, the Deputy Minister was challenged on this fact, that this is an online campaign only, and could only respond that the mapping exercise she will undertake. Therefore, the Deputy Minister needs to assure the committee and the public that universal support will be provided before the removal of the defence occurs. I've listened to what stakeholders and committees have said about the importance of ensuring sufficient time is available prior to the change in the law to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment during Stage 1. As a result, I have brought forward amendments in this group to provide certainty around the date for the change in the law. My amendment 7 will remove the power to commence this core provision of the Bill by Order of the Welsh Ministers and ensure that the defence of reasonable punishment is abolished at the end of a two-year period beginning the day after Royal Assent. Up to then, we'd always said 'up to two years'\u2014well, we're giving two years. This certainty will allow key partners, including the police, social services and the Crown Prosecution Service, to plan for changes to guidance, training and data-collection systems more effectively. My amendment 8 in this group has the consequence of removing the power to make transitional provision, which is replaced by my amendments 3 and 6, and we discussed those in the previous group. I've listened to the arguments put forward by Suzy Davies and Janet Finch-Saunders for the amendments in this group that they have tabled. These amendments are all about making the commencement of the Bill conditional on something else happening, whether it's waiting for the revision of Crown Prosecution Service guidance, or the establishment of a pathway for diversion from the criminal justice system, or for the provision of parenting support services. As I set out in my letter of response to the Stage 1 report from the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee, we've got good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group, and we work very closely with them. But the CPS are an independent body, as Suzy Davies has said in her contribution, not answerable to Welsh Ministers or this legislature, and it's not appropriate for a Minister or the National Assembly to seek to influence the CPS guidelines. And, in fact, I think that these amendments\u2014Suzy's amendments in particular\u2014wouldn't just seek to influence the CPS, but would actually give power to a non-devolved body on the way that we legislate in Wales. I think you have to rely on the fact that we have got this very good relationship, very close working relationship. And I think legislating to effectively give a non-devolved body a power to commence, or not, Assembly legislation would be highly unusual and would raise great uncertainty, I think, if we did go down that track, because I think this is very important Welsh legislation, which does have broad support across the Assembly. And I don't think we should allow non-devolved bodies to be the final arbiters of commencement of our legislation. I think the CPS is entirely independent of Government, and must be entirely independent of Government, and will make its own decisions about how and when it will revise its guidance. In addition, you suggest we allow the UK Government to have a say in when Welsh legislation is commenced in an area that was specifically devolved to the Assembly. If these amendments passed, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to judge when section 1 could be commenced. This contravenes what stakeholders and committees have asked for, and raises huge uncertainty, which potentially jeopardises the Bill. And I want to assure you again, not only do we have good working relations with the CPS, but also very good working relationships with the police, who are, of course, the other non-devolved body who have great involvement and interest in these issues. My amendment to provide a two-year period between Royal Assent and commencement means these groups can plan their work to a known timescale and deliver in good time before the law comes into force. And then, when it comes to parenting support, the committee knows that I've committed to reviewing the existing provision of parenting support, and work is already under way through the parenting expert group on this very issue. I have already said I will expand the age range of the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign, and I think\u2014. For example, the universal service of the health visitors is absolutely crucial, and that is a service that is for every child. And the expert group is considering what it'll recommend for the future, and it needs the time to be able to do that, to support the Bill as well as to support parenting more widely. So, as I said, I think these are important points that you have raised, but I don't think they are appropriate. So, I therefore urge the committee not to support amendments 9 and 10, nor 13, 14 and 15. suzy davies am: Thank you very much, and thank you very much, Deputy Minister, as well. I'm disappointed that you haven't seen what's behind Janet Finch-Saunders's final amendment there, actually. Maybe it's something we'll raise again with you at Stage 3, or maybe in the conversations that we have between now and then. But I want to go back to amendments 10 and 15 that I've raised and your assertion that we're giving, or attempting to give, power to the CPS here. And this is why I go back to where my contribution to this started, and it's your choice to try and resolve the problem of\u2014or, sorry, to try and protect children's rights through the medium of a change to the criminal law rather than the many opportunities that were available to you through the civil law and over which you would have had complete competence. This Bill\u2014and, actually, you've said a couple of times in your response today that it's important that it's commenced on a certain date. My argument is: it shouldn't be commenced at all unless you are absolutely certain about how it is likely to affect the parents who will now be captured by the removal of the defence. And, while I claim no mischief on the part of the CPS or the police\u2014obviously I don't\u2014there is nothing you can do that would prevent the CPS, should they wish to do it, or indeed the police with their own guidelines, putting in place something that is wholly disproportionate to the offence that is now being released by the removal of a defence. And, because of that, I ask you to consider, or balance, actually, two important things here: one is the rights of the child, obviously at the forefront of your argument on this, which I would argue could be completely and safely protected through the use of civil law on this occasion; and, actually, the rights of the child again to have a good relationship with parents over whose future they will have no say\u2014or at least you cannot allow them to have any say in how those parents might be treated in terms of sentencing. The relationship between parents and children obviously is different in every family, but that's something you ought to protect in what you're trying to do here, and by leaving it open, as you say, to completely different\u2014sorry, undevolved, two undevolved authorities to make decisions about how that relationship could be affected deeply worries me. I know this isn't going to stop your Bill going forward, but I really want you to consider my arguments and how you might try and address them at Stage 3, because leaving, effectively, the delivery of your policy objectives to somebody over whom you have no control, despite your great relationship with them, should worry us all as a legislature. Do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 9? suzy davies am: Oh, because of the voting order\u2014. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to move to a vote on amendment 7? julie morgan am: I do. lynne neagle am: I move amendment 7 in the name of the Deputy Minister.\u00a0The question is that amendment 7 be agreed. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 8? julie morgan am: I do. Well, that has brought us to the end of our amendments, so can I thank the Deputy Minister and her officials for their attendance? As usual, you will be sent a transcript of the meeting to check for factual accuracy. Standing Orders make provision for the Deputy Minister to prepare a revised explanatory memorandum, taking account of the amendments agreed today. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, following our meeting on 2 October. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services updating the committee on the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' strategy. And paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services regarding early childhood education and care, following the session that we held on 2 October. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting"

B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but marketing: Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . marketing: project manager: Yeah , but I've ta  marketing: project manager: right , I'll just re-do it . user interface: it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac . What's this this one ? user interface: Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . marketing: industrial designer: They're thinking user interface: But  , we didn't have anything small enough to write . industrial designer: For the first time , well it was hard to get the h  the actual labelling on the individual buttons . industrial designer: Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , user interface: marketing: Yeah . And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only  button that would be a different colour would be the  the red apple button . But  , yeah so  but there would be a cost implication on that , marketing: I'll see if I can find them . project manager: and  as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be  open to debate , I suppose . industrial designer: Yeah , sis user interface: Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , marketing: Have user interface: but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . marketing: project manager: Right , okay so  And the second one underneath would be the idea for the industrial designer: Yes , we'll have the slide-away . So So , we've got prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria ,  and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various  aspects that we're looking for  from  our previous meeting . user interface: project manager: So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but  obviously obviously it would . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , industrial designer: Yes , yes . project manager: and whether it would  marketing: So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? industrial designer: This this is a user interface: that's it . marketing: That's the pr project manager: Right , so  as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first  considerations was to be in d under   twelve fifty or two and a half  twelve and a half Euros . So that should  Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that  industrial designer: Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ? marketing: we should plug it in . marketing: Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . So , sh marketing: We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . project manager: Okay , so , by the fact that we've got  the simple chip and the  kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . industrial designer:  project manager: Well , originally , I thought there would just be  one in there because it was the one red apple . But industrial designer:  project manager: So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons marketing: Well do we'll do it on the prototype , project manager: O marketing: so do two , see how much it is . project manager: We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , industrial designer: And then we'd have project manager: so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special , marketing: project manager: So And the r  effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . I think you just do one , don't you , for the project manager: W I don't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore  , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore marketing: I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else project manager: Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . marketing: I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button . project manager:  Okay , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . project manager: And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . project manager: And if What happened ? marketing: You've just gone off the window into another one . user interface: Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . user interface: project manager: Okay , so , but the point would be that if we  if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . industrial designer: So that's nine point one there so we've got some project manager: So it Well , is it s is no , it's nine point seven I've got . industrial designer: Just give us a bit of project manager: So , that would that would work out fine if   as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . project manager: And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had  planned to put on . user interface: S marketing: industrial designer: I switching around those th  on the electronics we got the sample sensor . industrial designer: I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech marketing: Yeah .  , if we Okay , that gives us twelve point seven industrial designer: So  maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition project manager: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the industrial designer: without project manager: Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , marketing: Yeah , we have to have it industrial designer: Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . industrial designer: We should Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov project manager: But you reckon that i  the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them .  , whether they would figure the the s  sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . industrial designer: or whatever they would prefer not  You know what  ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the  losing the remote . project manager: But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to  make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . marketing: Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? project manager: So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . Sorry , do you want that back up ? marketing: Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . user interface: But I do think  the v  voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . project manager: Okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . Right okay  , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . user interface: marketing: And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end .  so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . So if we do a sort of a one So industrial designer: Okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . industrial designer: then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . marketing: Of but I think What Is one false , or is t one true ? user interface: One's true . user interface: Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . So , false is seven , true is one , and So  say about a two for fancy , industrial designer: Yeah . Well , it's just that  saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got  various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . marketing: Yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ? project manager: Okay . And  , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? industrial designer: deciding between the kinetic power or  the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , industrial designer:  marketing: we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . marketing: Alright , so project manager: Didn't you ? Or marketing: So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of  fulfilling the industrial designer: No may is maybe about neutral user interface: Maybe a three . industrial designer: plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got marketing: Okay . project manager: The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that industrial designer: 'Kay . project manager: the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at  just special colours  is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . project manager: And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your  sample sensor speaker , industrial designer:  project manager: and then you're looking to  take out  point two , marketing: S I'm just gonna check my email . user interface: How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would  enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could  fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . industrial designer: So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so project manager: Yeah . project manager: Ye marketing: I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . project manager: Well , okay , but user interface: Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . marketing: So ,  does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the  the speech project manager: We got we've we've got thirteen point seven user interface: Yeah . project manager: and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . project manager: But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too industrial designer: Yeah , yeah .  , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , m  user interface: Maybe two ? industrial designer: Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . industrial designer: I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's  project manager: Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . project manager: The product is a recognisable real r  reaction product ? marketing: Yeah , this is industrial designer:  the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , marketing: This project manager: industrial designer: and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Does it fit in with our other other products , which  are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . project manager: S user interface: marketing: user interface: well it's got the same  speech feature as the coffee machine . marketing: What do y industrial designer: Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . So we're going for a two , marketing: So industrial designer: Maybe a kind of three ?  d project manager: three ? user interface: Yeah , two or three . marketing: Two or three ? user interface: Well , the logo would be more  recognisable on the actual thing . project manager: So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then marketing: Yeah . user interface: What does what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate or anything ? marketing: Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head . industrial designer: Yeah , so it's marketing: So So it's  it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . industrial designer: So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . marketing: Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances project manager: Okay , well I put it back on . industrial designer: So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? project manager: marketing: I'm not sure . project manager: Okay , so what was it , control  F_ eight , wasn't it ? user interface: Ah it's on . So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . industrial designer: Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , project manager: That's right . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case .",
        " project manager: Okay , so industrial designer: And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of project manager: So we're going for plastic , yes ? marketing: Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but project manager: Yep . industrial designer: Oh yeah , and that would now be marketing: And then industrial designer: Yeah , that's that's within the budget .  Do we actually have Do we just have one special  special forms down here ? project manager: Well ,  w  there was debate as to how you would count them . industrial designer:  project manager: Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour . industrial designer: And we we've we've got we've got enough for another user interface: Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . industrial designer: so we've got enough for another project manager: Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special industrial designer: Yeah ,  project manager: So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . industrial designer: But the but but but the project manager: The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . industrial designer: I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . industrial designer: Yeah , which I think we should Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price . marketing: Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas  of rubber , isn't it . project manager: The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ? industrial designer: Ne  user interface: Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . user interface: marketing: Okay , so tha industrial designer: So I think that should still be okay . industrial designer: So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , project manager: Yep . industrial designer: but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the project manager: I woulda said so . marketing: So shall we do a Well ,  industrial designer: And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name ? project manager: Real Reaction produ user interface: Real Reactions ? industrial designer: R yeah . user interface: industrial designer:  it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of  inno innovative c type company , then  having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on marketing: Yeah , so  project manager: Yep I would s marketing: So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so project manager: You mean of industrial designer:  marketing: And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , project manager: Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , industrial designer: So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . project manager: Yeah , we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? marketing: Is it industrial designer: That yeah , that was  marketing: The rubber . industrial designer: I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . industrial designer:  So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? marketing: But  industrial designer: I dunno . marketing: So  , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . industrial designer: And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so project manager: Well , ease has certainly stayed . And what about the sort of innovation ? industrial designer: well we've still got the kinetic energy . We've maybe lost Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect project manager: How it would play out , yeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know .  industrial designer: But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what marketing: Yeah . Okay , well  user interface: Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more .  , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . user interface: But then what colour would you make the R_s ? industrial designer: just the the company logo . project manager: Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . marketing: Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or industrial designer: I'm still not quite sure we've established that . user interface: I just project manager: But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with  the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . user interface: project manager: There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , marketing:  . project manager: so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the  on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . marketing: Or would that be t project manager: Well , we decided that the blue ones were the  the standard colour . project manager: So you were talking about   We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . industrial designer:  marketing: Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? project manager: Well , yeah . Bu but but  was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the  on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that  you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? user interface: I don't think they would really need to be . industrial designer: Yeah , maybe we've m user interface: Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well . industrial designer: Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and  , fit the kind of idea of what they want . industrial designer: And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .  it's the sort of thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . project manager: Yeah , well marketing: So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . user interface: Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . project manager: marketing: Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit  shape on one of the buttons . marketing: le lemon sh user interface: Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? On the volume ones ? marketing: I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ? industrial designer: You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . project manager: So what bit are we on to ? user interface: can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: project manager: marketing: project manager: Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I . user interface: So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? marketing: Well , we're aiming for  one for all of them . marketing: M but it really has to fit into the budget , so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the Which is fair enough . Yeah , I think industrial designer: As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . What's on the agenda ? project manager: Right , okay  What's happened here ? Right , okay   . So we got So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now  , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . project manager: I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . Well , we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings , project manager: In you on your own . marketing: and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , project manager:  marketing: and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that . project manager: The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . So industrial designer: Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time marketing: Yeah . project manager: Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , industrial designer: and then diff things will be relevant . project manager: Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? user interface: marketing: project manager: I've put , seemed okay . industrial designer: Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . project manager: You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so marketing: But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we user interface: marketing: that's , you know , fifteen quid . Like  , companies can have like a range of products and project manager: I th I  d industrial designer: I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of project manager: But the other thing is that  they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this  software to to demonstrate how you could  do a project . project manager:  for  you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . project manager: So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can  ask whatever question . And then you or the idea is that the whichever  person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or  or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . So  , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the  computer software to enable  to enable it to work .  if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction ,  it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . So project manager: Does industrial designer: voice recognition , especially not could project manager: You've got voice recognition computers , marketing:  yeah . Okay , industrial designer: Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . marketing: I don't think sort of the budget  allowed us to do anything project manager: Bit bit arbitrary . marketing: Well ,  I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products .  , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d  lightweight computer screens , project manager: marketing: and  I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . project manager: So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . user interface: marketing: Surely they they should produ project manager: And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . user interface: But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager . project manager: Now , I'd much rather be in marketing user interface: marketing: project manager: but I certainly didn't get this  computer to work as well as I would have liked . marketing: project manager: However ,  Alright  means , so whiteboard  so really , it's  equipment . marketing: Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but user interface: But  , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these .  , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug the computer or something ? marketing: I think there's a little there's a little  chi industrial designer: So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so marketing: There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something industrial designer: Should we quickly look at the last slide ? marketing: and it produces a industrial designer: Sh user interface: Right . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and Page after page . project manager:  and  voice marketing: project manager: was it voice activated  marketing: Voice recognition , yeah . marketing: To fill in these fill in these questionnaires project manager: Right , so ,  are the costs within budget , marketing: Oh no . Is that everything ? marketing:  ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .  , so we don't re So really I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere "

        "Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Gr\u0175p Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. dafydd evans: Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. dafydd evans: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. nick brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\u00a0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\u00a0meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bac\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\u00a0those professional sectors. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\u00a0initially, but the Welsh bac\u00a0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\u00a0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand\u00a0the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications\u00a0that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries. sian gwenllian am: Kay, is that your experience? kay martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications.\u00a0But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they\u00a0want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. ed evans: Do you mind if I carry on in English\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Fine. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular\u2014the civil engineering sector\u2014and particularly the\u00a0contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to\u2014. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and\u00a0supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would\u00a0be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate. sian gwenllian am: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course? dafydd evans: I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within\u00a0that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications\u00a0board, I think\u00a0the employers\u2014. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the\u00a0vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate\u2014that it was going to improve skills for employment. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in\u00a0my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. They're there to serve a really good purpose, but it's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic, whereas the Welsh bac offers an opportunity\u2014. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more\u00a0structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we\u00a0join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it. kay martin: Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world. So, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college. sian gwenllian am: So, do we get rid of it? lynne neagle am: You don't need to answer that. [Laughter.] sian gwenllian am: if there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it? nick brazil: I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac\u2014I think when we go back a number of years\u2014was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and\u00a0I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that. suzy davies am: Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014. dafydd evans: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\u00a0C grade in the core subjects. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow\u2014no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. We've given priority to GCSE\u00a0resits\u00a0rather than doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3. nick brazil: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification\u2014it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac\u2014for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well\u2014that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes\u2014and we all get funded on the outcomes\u2014that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh\u2014I thought that's something that we need to think about. kay martin: If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things. Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels, even in a vocational programme, it's too big for them. As you say, they're coming from schools, some of them with very few GCSEs, or they haven't got literacy and numeracy skills, they're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy. So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people\u2014the A-level students for university\u2014but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't. dr rachel bowen: And this, ultimately, has to be about what's in the best interests of learners, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study. dafydd evans: That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way\u2014 kay martin: Great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then\u2014'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges,\u00a0but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented\u2014we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that\u00a0have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac\u2014normally. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals? nick brazil: Yes. nick brazil: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us\u2014certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners\u2014that a number of them have come from school and\u00a0probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do\u2014think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a\u00a0low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels. dr rachel bowen: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college. janet finch-saunders am: Okay.\u00a0A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac? kay martin: Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. I talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well, but it was a very paper-based exercise. But I think it is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here\u2014University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University\u2014value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students go to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners go to USW. It is valued by them and they accept it, but when people go further afield\u2014and we're always trying to push our learners beyond. lynne neagle am: Did you have a supplementary, Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: Yes. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely. nick brazil: Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt\u2014in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities,\u00a0the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject. Because of the nature of our catchment area, there is a greater percentage of our students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac. But, naturally, we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and we're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities. sian gwenllian am: But in terms of Bangor and Glynd\u0175r University, there's no problem there, though. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that. dafydd evans: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes? I'm certainly not sure, and perhaps we need to think: what are we trying to achieve with this qualification? julie morgan am: Right. kay martin: Yes, and earlier, we talked as well about that difference for the A-level students. For the vocational students, some things like the Career Ready programme, which is used in other colleges, and WorldSkills, you know, where all colleges have really been pushing to get more learners into WorldSkills at national and international level. And for some of our learners, particularly if we take our engineering learners, then having somebody who has competed in Europe as a tiler or an electrician would, I think, make an employer think, 'I'd better look at this person', whereas the other one\u00a0has done the Welsh bac\u2014.",
        "\u00a0I think they would look at the WorldSkills person first. So, for some of our learners, we choose that you do WorldSkills, because that is going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time you've put in. So, they put a lot of time\u2014you know, to get somebody into a WorldSkills competition is not just a couple of hours a week, it isn't just the normal curriculum\u2014they have extra time. They are more able and talented vocational learners, and that is more valuable to those learners and I think it's more valid for employers than the Welsh baccalaureate. You know, it is comparable, as long as it's right for that learner's future. But if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the Welsh bac is not accepted, it's not comparable. But, then, if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector, absolutely. julie morgan am: What are the reasons why some colleges do see it as being rigorous and others don't? Why does the view vary? ed evans: Can I give perhaps an employer's perspective on that, which might be completely wrong, but it's been interesting listening to what's been said here? About a year ago, we bought the\u00a0WJEC in to speak to our employers, or a number of them, just to explain to them what the Welsh bac was about\u2014back to listening and about understanding, really, and it just was not there at all. I could see that most of the employers\u00a0there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand\u2014'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there. kay martin: It probably depends on the subjects that\u00a0people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac\u2014even if they're not doing that. dafydd evans: I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac\u00a0in terms of\u2014I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac\u00a0within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about. nick brazil: On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac\u00a0are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is. dr rachel bowen: I think the baccalaureate\u00a0approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. suzy davies am: Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac\u00a0is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac\u00a0anyway. Is that a fair observation? dr rachel bowen: I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac\u00a0under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see. nick brazil: Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term. lynne neagle am: Julie, did you have any more questions? julie morgan am: No, I've finished, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption. suzy davies am: Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners,\u00a0i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac\u00a0is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have\u00a0a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their Welsh language skills. We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh\u2014. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac\u00a0in many cases. , if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come\u00a0on in and you won't have to do it.' suzy davies am: Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty? dafydd evans: Yes, absolutely. suzy davies am: Oh, yes, for the reasons you've given in the evidence, actually. dafydd evans: Yes, but across the whole of level 3, A-level and vocational, the Welsh bac\u00a0is an integral part of the curriculum, and it isn't an option for the student to opt out. lynne neagle am: Do you let your Seren\u00a0students opt out like they do in Cardiff and the Vale, or do they have to do it as well? dafydd evans: We've forced\u2014. nick brazil: I've got to be honest, at present, with our college, we do not ask. It's an option of one of our choices\u2014we have a large choice\u2014and I think it comes back to that fact that we're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions. I think it's something we all need to consider across the nation, that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future. I will go back to the point I made earlier\u2014everything's comparable as long as it's the right thing for the learner's future, and I genuinely believe, and I'm sure a lot of colleagues believe, that that choice element is important to a learner, okay. If it is the right choice and if the Welsh bac\u00a0is the right choice, that is correct, and we move that along. But you've got to be doing the right things for the learner, and we are certainly not selling it, 'Come\u00a0to us; you don't do the Welsh bac.' It is part of what we offer. It is part of what the college's curriculum offers\u2014there is no doubt about that\u2014and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future. You explained earlier that if people knew what the bac was about in your sector, they'd value it more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular\u2014who are needed in your sector, after all\u2014might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners\u2014presumably you need them all. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. Again, I'll come back to the input of businesses to support that delivery of commercial skills and so on, but I think I probably made that point earlier. There's clearly going to be different individuals who will cope better, and they will be, I guess, maybe guided as well by parents to a certain degree in terms of, 'You do those four and forget about that nonsense there', which is not helpful, but I can understand why that happens. I guess that's what a lot of our employers saw the Welsh bac\u00a0as being able to do. nick brazil: Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification? lynne neagle am: And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools? nick brazil: As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come\u00a0to us for this particular reason.' lynne neagle am: No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'? nick brazil: The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask,\u00a0'Do\u00a0I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask. sian gwenllian am: And is that the parents asking the question or the pupil? nick brazil: It's a combination. But, honest answer, I would say parents, a lot of the time, but the learners usually\u2014as I said\u2014have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away. sian gwenllian am: Can I suggest that maybe, then, the perception that parents have is steering the way rather than the actual benefits for the pupil in your institution? If you're telling them, 'Come\u00a0to us, you don't have to actually do it because we know you don't like it', is that the correct way of approaching education? nick brazil: No. nick brazil: Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes\u2014if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra\u2014Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac\u00a0to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.' sian gwenllian am: But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time\u2014and parents\u2014they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we\u00a0did\u2014. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run. Anybody want to pick that up? dafydd evans: We certainly have experience of that, of young people coming in with quite a negative attitude, originally, to the Welsh bac and taking it on board. But where we are delivering it well, well contextualised, they've really enjoyed the experience, and very much valued the experience. dafydd evans: But don't underestimate the fact that\u00a0if you had a poor experience of the Welsh bac\u00a0at school, that perception is very difficult for us, as institutions, then, to change. dr rachel bowen: It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things. kay martin: Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC\u00a0programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels\u2014. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that? dafydd evans: I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac\u2014. nick brazil: And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac\u00a0are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification. dawn bowden am: And have you got dedicated time? Because one of the things we picked up from schools was that teachers in particular were kind of fitting it in with other lessons, and therefore, it wasn't being, again, given the same perceived level of importance as doing A-levels were. But your lecturers would all have dedicated time to deliver\u2014 kay martin: On their timetables, yes. ed evans: I was just going to add there, really, if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular, if you've got that\u00a0far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this\u2014. Apologies, I'd almost forgotten that we were in the Colegau thing, I was thinking 'schools' actually [Laughter.] But in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way, not an ad-hoc way, which is just a friend turning up to talk about something, a structured way\u2014. We have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum' in the sector that we hope to roll out. Now, if that was rolled out across the board\u2014I'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular, but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled, global areas, because it's not their bag. So, bring in\u00a0some experts, bring in some business, raise the profile, and I think then, possibly, you'll start to get parents thinking, 'Actually, there is something more to this than just the academic bit.' dawn bowden am: Okay. Can I just ask\u2014? You've all got slightly different policies; they don't have to do it in Swansea, in Cardiff and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-levels. Do you think that's a satisfactory situation, and are you satisfied with the communication and the guidance and the steer that everyone's getting from Welsh Government on this? Because we're meant to have a policy of universal adoption, but that doesn't really seem to be happening on the ground. kay martin: And I think, if you'd asked us a few years ago, we were all heading for universal adoption, but because the Welsh bac\u00a0has changed into something that isn't 100 per cent what we think it should be, then we've stopped the universal adoption, if you like. So, we are trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but I think, as you said, we've mentioned some other programmes, and if we could look at\u2014. We've got industry experts that are brought into colleges as well, some more than others, to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better. We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning. nick brazil: I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac\u00a0is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, paper to note 2 is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales on home education, and paper to note 3 is the letter that the Cabinet Secretary for Education has sent to us in reply to our letter about free school meals. Item 4, then: can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Yes."

Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "project manager: S how we doing on our remote ? user interface: project manager: We have some we have some ideas and some  ideas for what people want . user interface:  we yes s I've lo marketing: user interface: I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway .  then we can come to a conclusion on  what we want the remote to do ,  and how it's going to do it hopefully . I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes ,  and coming up with the final presentation . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . user interface: project manager:  we decided our remote ,  we want it to be a universal remote  that everyone would want . I'll hand it off to you and  Does anyone do you wanna go first ? marketing: Sure . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ? marketing: No I want something else on mine . marketing: So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and project manager: I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? marketing: yeah .  so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , industrial designer: marketing: by  doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . And if anyone could clarify what that means ? industrial designer: Just jus user interface: Is is it j just just marketing: Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? user interface: just using it industrial designer: yeah .  and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control .  the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control .  we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . user interface: Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . marketing: user interface: And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely .  that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it ,  because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they're a nightmare to use . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s .  or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more  specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control  which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent  is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away .  and finally ,   sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated .  Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex .  and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . project manager: What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on  the i user interface: On something on the image of it . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , marketing: project manager: industrial designer: so  I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Who knows ? Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to project manager: So we could the the industrial designer: to the industrial design department . project manager: the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive industrial designer: Expensive it's gonna be get  . project manager: But people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . user interface: I think speech recognition was  one of those things where  they have to be really good for them to work . Well user interface: And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well . project manager: I myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . project manager: and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . marketing: project manager: So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know , you user interface: And wou I don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . marketing: Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . user interface: I think As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . user interface: But practically I don't think it's project manager: It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and user interface: Yeah .  the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that  not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly .  but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . And we could probably get away with black too but So those are the three  the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use .  from all all three of your  presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . project manager: But  it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . project manager: That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . Or you know However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . project manager: we still have the how to hold on to it industrial designer: You s you still W yeah . industrial designer: While you're watching , marketing: Rolls away industrial designer: it's gonna roll off . I guess our , I guess our main  main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? marketing: Not really . user interface: I'll yeah I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . user interface: I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . project manager:  Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific  target group ? That way we could l  if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's  a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ?  Would that you think that would help us find  a specific form ? That we would would wanna pick out ? user interface: D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . So  we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . project manager: you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . project manager: And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom marketing: project manager: or the user interface: Bottom perhaps project manager: you know . project manager: Maybe we could sketch a so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort .  Hope everyone memorised that  user interface: You  it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . user interface: They've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things .  user interface: marketing: project manager: But they are all , industrial designer: project manager: you know , mobile phones  they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . project manager: But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big marketing: project manager: and you had a handbag to carry it around in .  user interface: project manager: So we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . If you , if we want the remote to do other things like  or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . project manager: 'Kay so industrial designer: It's project manager:  industrial designer: Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . industrial designer: You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . industrial designer: Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . Maybe the buttons could like  decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . So you know you just sort of have your hand industrial designer:  well I was just thinking , this this of course causes user interface: Yeah . user interface: But  the older so project manager: Yeah is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? You guys all right-handed ? marketing: Right . project manager: I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . user interface:  I'm just just thinking maybe if it was  circular  with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down ,  volume , and on-off .  So for the next So for the next  before the next meeting w  sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . project manager: Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . project manager: Let's go with our our  rounded kind of fit in your hand let's explore  the the  possibility of having the two-piece . So one for the the quick zapping  and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . project manager: And Ryan you work on  how how well they'll work with the us with the user . Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting "

        " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "marketing: user interface: industrial designer: marketing: industrial designer: project manager: user interface:  project manager: industrial designer: user interface: No , no . Not all the small buttons , you don't know project manager: Is this positive or negative , that  big buttons ? industrial designer: Big buttons , positive . industrial designer: All all small buttons like when you have  like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . What are your experiences ? user interface:  well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And  I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED   a LED on the corner of the of the remote . And that if you push the button the LED  gives a light , and  and you see that it's working .  project manager: So and do they always have that ? user interface: Yeah , but No no no . marketing:  at home we have a T_V_ , a video  recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . But  i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? industrial designer: The weight . industrial designer: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some  some sort of bleep . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah I think it  from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . So you don't won't have to change the batteries  once a week or  once every two weeks "

        "Okay and the agenda will be the opening and  that's  the product manager or secretary that's me and  the presentations from the Christine and  Agnes and from Mister Ed . And finally in this meeting we have to decide marketing: project manager: and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and  the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's  little bit  low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about  the components concept . So  project manager: industrial designer: we were looking he specifically at the components  the following components ,  the case , the power supply ,  the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , project manager: industrial designer: you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , but  maybe you do have it a a way marketing: industrial designer: it has to it has to hear the speaker user interface: industrial designer: and  , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone ,  and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Our method for going about this is we've looked at  the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also  we wanted to evaluate some new materials marketing: industrial designer: and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so  this is the approach that we took during our  our research . marketing: industrial designer: So  for the case ,  we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . marketing: industrial designer: Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but  that  doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can  we can really seriously explore , user interface: industrial designer: so then we were thinking about  rubber , but  unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat  factor user interface: industrial designer: and th  there might be some problems with the m  how it's  goes with the board .  and  then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , user interface: industrial designer: so  we still had titanium and and wood available , but  unfortunately   titanium's also been eliminated  , user interface: industrial designer: the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but  nevertheless  they've eliminated all of our options except wood . marketing: industrial designer: And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly  material , so we're we're currently  proposing , marketing: industrial designer:  we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . marketing: industrial designer: So then there's this other matter of the chips and  well we could use a simple design on the board , user interface: project manager: industrial designer:  these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much  intelligence with this simple one . And  then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one .  the other option was this advanced chip on print , and  we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , marketing: industrial designer: which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . marketing: industrial designer: And  manufacturing has told us that they've   recently developed a  a sensor and a speaker that would  be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so  we we  now jumping right to our personal preferences  I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of  some really exotic woods , like  , user interface: industrial designer: you know  , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this  three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I  think we should go with the solar cells as well as the  microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research marketing: industrial designer: and my recommendations  for the new remote control w  would be to have  have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ? project manager: Can you go back  one slide ? industrial designer: I'm not sure , how do I Oh , I know , let's see . project manager: Yes ,  question , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ? industrial designer: I think it's   a multiple  chip design  and it's  maybe printed on to the circuit board . project manager: Yeah , is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or  industrial designer: I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . project manager: Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . user interface: Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? industrial designer: Because  it gets brittle , cracks user interface: user interface: industrial designer: I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . user interface: Although I think marketing: user interface: I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you ,  it chips , it if you drop it , industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  it's I'm not su industrial designer: project manager: So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . user interface: industrial designer: you're what ? marketing: Actually , I'm ready to sell it . user interface: I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , marketing: I'm ready to sell it . industrial designer: You think ? And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . user interface: but you can't just use marketing: No y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , user interface: Yeah , exactly , yeah . industrial designer: Well I'm glad you user interface: marketing: That's actually very innovative idea . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that  you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . marketing:  it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . user interface: project manager: Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design  , what about yo you ? marketing: user interface: in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own project manager: Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first marketing: In turns of wow . industrial designer: user interface: industrial designer: She works in the cubicle next to me so she's  she was already a little bit prepared for this . user interface: marketing: Wood ? user interface: I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . marketing: user interface: One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having  industrial designer: Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your user interface: Yeah , for example . So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , marketing: industrial designer: It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . user interface: but marketing: user interface: marketing: They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , industrial designer: Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , which basically shows , sort of marketing: user interface: I took the ideas that we were talking about last time  and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .  , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , marketing: user interface: so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . user interface: And also  you had issues with the batteries running out , marketing: user interface: so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and  tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . user interface: So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like marketing: user interface: Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ project manager: user interface: and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . user interface: so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip thing and Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . project manager: user interface: which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . user interface: But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . user interface: So , that's pretty much all I had to say , everything else in terms of design issues .  the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and  the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , industrial designer: user interface: So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause  trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . This is what we know from the last  from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that  , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . The second one , there is about  forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read ,  very hard to use . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: The first one , I see that they put in a display . Now there's something else  with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , user interface: marketing: but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . marketing: Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display user interface: industrial designer: Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . marketing: Okay Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , user interface: Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and marketing: yeah . marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good ,  with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours user interface: industrial designer: user interface: project manager: industrial designer: You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like  a   b some sort of a foam rubber  ball , marketing: we might've user interface: Oh yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific industrial designer: To t an and then you would know like  what the geometry of their hands would be and  marketing: project manager: marketing: How hard they squeeze ? user interface: industrial designer: Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get . user interface: But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . industrial designer: That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: No , but incorporating the three  obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: and from user interface: Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . marketing: Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: We'd also have to wor  consider that  who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna  learn about  labour laws . project manager: industrial designer: You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit  labour in  third world countries . industrial designer: So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're  par the reason the cost is high for the device is because  you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . project manager: Yeah , but we can get a production in , countries like , India industrial designer: Cost of living is low . project manager: yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . So industrial designer: Good , well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to  explore more project manager: Yeah , yeah , so Yes . project manager: So Yeah , so industrial designer: Yeah marketing: We're here to design , come up with a nice product . project manager: Yes  , but  that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . project manager: So we don't need to have our own  fabric factory or something , industrial designer: project manager: so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different  electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but  le let's decide first about the components concept and  interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what  Ed was talking . And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so user interface: I think it depends ,  I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you . user interface: So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . user interface:  it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for industrial designer:  . user interface: 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , project manager: user interface: but that's just sort of speculation ,  . industrial designer: What do you think Ed ? Do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , do you know how much it costs , to to add a little display like this  ? marketing: No . No industrial designer: Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? marketing: no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . industrial designer: So the the advanced chip on print is what  what we've we've deci we've determined marketing: industrial designer: and the  engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and  I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding  this concept of a wooden case . user interface: What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or industrial designer:  I don't think so , no , project manager: I don't think so . industrial designer: so you have that tactile experience of project manager: Don't looks nice  . Yeah , so  what we'll do is , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until  th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . project manager: maybe what you can do is  , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: So  are we done with this meeting ? project manager: Yeah , I hope , if is it okay if  they will come up with the prototype design , okay . Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can  submit to the I will submit to the management . Okay ? Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for  the display . user interface: project manager: Of course you'll make money too , industrial designer: project manager: so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . user interface: marketing: user interface: marketing: project manager: Okay , so , any questions ? user interface: No . project manager: So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then  , then we can proceed from there . project manager: So thanks for all your  efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then "

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah .

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        " hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .  I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . project manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? user interface: Yes , I think so .  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . I just sent user interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , project manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , user interface: yeah . project manager:  and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . So I would say industrial designer: You said  targ target groups , project manager: yeah ? industrial designer: what does that mean ? project manager: As  who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , user interface:  industrial designer:  okay , 'kay . industrial designer: So are project manager: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on industrial designer: Okay .  so f from the project manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , user interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . So n  with  with regard to the  working design of this   remote control  I've identified  a few basic  components of the remote and  se  from the design , functional design perspective  w I c we can now  know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .  the identification of the components ,  and  since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person  and  from the user interface person . industrial designer: and  basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  so basically  the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  and what are the different processes  and how the parts  communicate with each other .  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .  also  the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features  makes it more comp complex . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing  with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .  also the management wants that  our design should be unique  it so it should incorporate  colour and the slogan  that our company  has it as its standard . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . So if  if this is our energy source and this is a cell ,  it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h  how how to do everything . So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,  which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .  so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do ,  make the chip more complicated  and bigger , basically .  so i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . And  also if we can incorporate  the latest features in our chip design , so that our   remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most  televisions . project manager: Do you have any  i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer: but  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so  I just identified the functional components for that . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some  design issues then I I I would like to continue project manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? user interface: okay , yeah . project manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . project manager: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you user interface: There's just nothing . project manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , user interface: Oh right , right , right ,  project manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . project manager: Now it's coming , industrial designer: It'll come up , it   no signal . user interface: No signal ? Why ? project manager: Maybe again ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now , user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again user interface: This is the problem , but project manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design  just like some some first issues that came up .  'kay , so the method I was  adopting at this point , it's not  for the for the whole  period of the  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . user interface:   my method was  to look at  other  remote controls ,  so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what  functionality they used . And then  after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web  just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what  what the user might desire as additional  functionalities . user interface:  so the findings  were  that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And  w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,  then the user would like to switch the channel  for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then   the other possibility would be that  she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .   I als industrial designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? user interface: okay .   among the findings I found that m m most of the curr  presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities  in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update  actually  we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . industrial designer: user interface: So my personal preferences would be  to keep the  the whole remote control small  just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions  like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .  then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then  other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then ,  for example brightness and  similar functions could be just  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n  more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . user interface: If you have questions project manager: If  that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . user interface: Yeah , and also it's it's  other question is  because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included marketing: project manager: user interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the   video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . industrial designer: project manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? industrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements    we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .  but  so so at this stage ,  how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  in we can completely do away with buttons and  have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But  is is there any   any thoughts on that ? user interface:  well , I think the buttons are still  kind of the most  easy for the user to use , industrial designer: Right . user interface:   what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user industrial designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . user interface: and and  the user just wants to get  get a result  quickly , not to spend time in like  giving several orders  I dunno . user interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other  proposals  . industrial designer:  I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . industrial designer:  i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: try to press project manager: Is it plugged in prop industrial designer: oh , okay , marketing: It's working . marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab  observed remote control use with  a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .  so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and  the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . project manager: marketing:  current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .  I dunno what zapping is , but project manager: It's  switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .  okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , industrial designer: Right .  but project manager: I liked the , I liked the litt marketing: ooh where's it go ? project manager: ooh come back . marketing:  okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . project manager: - , that's the next one along , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like  their importance , you know , project manager: marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , industrial designer: marketing:  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  that they get lost , that the  you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . marketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from  you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , project manager: The remote control . Okay , so   the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages industrial designer: Right . marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . Right ,  sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .  so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but  you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and  , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .  there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . marketing:  okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and  , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . industrial designer: marketing:  and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or industrial designer:  . marketing: not a mobile phone industrial designer: Some kind of a ring , project manager: Keys and things like that , industrial designer: some marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , industrial designer: Right . marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , project manager: marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . I think one of the very interesting things that came up in   Ka Kate Cat Cat's  presentation was   this this issue of   like voice recognition being more popular with  younger people . industrial designer: So if we need to have a target group  then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and  you know , good looking  we are better off targeting a younger audience then  you know , people who are comparatively elderly . marketing: Yeah ,  that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then  th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager: project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer: Right , and project manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . marketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know project manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah , project manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface: you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer: But  still , if if you can go back to that slide and  , how popular was it ? project manager: O oh it's on marketing: Oh , I've unplugged it . marketing: Do you want me to project manager: Here , let me industrial designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh   people between twenty five to thirty five ,  how popular was marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I kn  I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like  , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , project manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and marketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: you don't normally have a car , project manager: usually not a car and all of those things . industrial designer: So you're more likely to b marketing: so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing: No ,  that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , project manager: user interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full project manager: Yeah . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , project manager: But do they user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah user interface: Common , the students yeah , yeah . user interface: yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , industrial designer:  user interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ . marketing: industrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? project manager: marketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . user interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of   marketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . marketing: You know , so  that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . user interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer:  project manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on  m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p  things that Cat pointed out was   how do we go about implementing it ?  and  project manager: marketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like  every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , user interface: An industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , project manager:  . marketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know industrial designer: project manager: marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement  for for a limited user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface: Yeah but   Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager: Yeah , user interface: and  , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: What  user interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this  separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular  in the sense that  a person can say , I want to watch  I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . industrial designer: Yeah , so if  if something like that can be incorporated , marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . industrial designer: some kind of marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . marketing: Yeah , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: and that would be really annoying . user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just  speak into it project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager: So that you can yell at it , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think   the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer:  yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager:  . user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and  not to yell at it from the distance . So  wh another thing  that can be used is that  there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so you can go and press that button and  and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , project manager: project manager: but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , user interface: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface: The major ones , yeah . project manager:  but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning  . project manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break industrial designer: project manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . project manager:  I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . industrial designer: So where exactly is this i project manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . user interface: Did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah in that one , user interface: It's just yeah , yeah . marketing: Oh , so y you want our  PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager: Yeah , that would be great . user interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , project manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . project manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . project manager:  as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . marketing: project manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface:  something conceptual , yeah . project manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that marketing: project manager:  we'll keep keep our options op  ? industrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . user interface: Sorry , but  the next meeting  are we going to have it  right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . project manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . project manager: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? marketing: user interface: Okay , see you ."

        "anthony rota (nipissingtimiskaming, lib.)): I call the meeting to order.  Welcome to the third meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Pursuant to the order of reference of Monday, April20, the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements, allowing members to present petitions, and questioning ministers of the crown, including the Prime Minister, in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand there's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the Canadian Armed Forces who lost their lives last Wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of Greece. Colleagues, we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. As we do, Canadians, like everyone around the world, are doing their best to live their lives until things improve. Meanwhile, as we look towards the future, I believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history. Andrea McCrady, is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands by the Canadian Forces. In May 1945, Canadian Forces played a major role in liberating the Dutch people from Nazi occupation. May 5 is now a national holiday in the Netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries. Let me remind you that, as in the House or in committee, members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings, I will outline a few rules. If you look at the bottom, you have a little flag that indicates whether it's English or French, and that's how we will be speaking.  I would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions.  In addition, to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous Parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. It includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person's consent. The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. I want to remind all the members that there are specific headsets that have been mandated to all of us. If you don't have one, please talk to your IT ambassador and they will get one to you as quickly as possible. The reason for them is not so much for what you hear, but that our interpreters are working and there are work conditions that really make it difficult. Part of that is not having the appropriate boom on your headset, which will make it very difficult for them to hear and interpret for our members. The petitioners have noted that there are approximately 60 indigenous languages in Canada and that 2019, last year, was declared by the UN to be the year of indigenous languages. They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16. Fundamentally, they call upon the Government of Canada to recognize indigenous languages as being official languages of Canada and to have each language recognized nationally, with implementations on regional and provincial levels, acknowledging that many regions have different languages. Chair, I am proud to present a petition on behalf of one of my constituents, Myles Lynch of St. Myles lives with cystic fibrosis and has had three lung transplants in the last five years, and he's only 22 years old. One thing Myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program. I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system. Chair, I'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton, Ontario, who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have signed similar petitions. Given that Canadians are living through unprecedented, catastrophic climate events, and at the same time our society, as you know, is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of Canadian families are only $200 away from insolvency in any given monthand particularly given the pandemic that we are currently experiencing, these petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support motion M-1, a made-in-Canada green new deal that I am presenting in front of the House of Commons. It calls on Canada to take bold and rapid action to tackle the climate emergency, and to put in place a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy. Chair, it's an honour to table a petition on behalf of constituents from CourtenayAlberni. Over 12,000 Canadians have died over the last four years due to fentanyl-poisoned sources. They cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted in the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl. They are citing that regulating to ensure safe sources, with proper measures and bylaws, will reduce the criminal element associated with street drugs. They are calling on the Government of Canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the Emergencies Act. They are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source. Chair, I'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of Canadians in my riding with the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities. The petitioners in MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on providing the Canada Border Services Agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively. I would like to remind honourable members that no member shall be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. I want to again remind honourable members to use the boom on the official headsets so that everything runs smoothly, not only for ourselves but also for the interpreters. pierre paul-hus (charlesbourghaute-saint-charles, cpc): Thank you, Mr.Chair. Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. justin trudeau (prime minister): Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country. However, I would like to know whether he considers that, with this order in council, organized crime, street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons. We are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities, to strengthen the control at our borders, and to implement other measures. member speak of those measures, because we are going to work together in the House to strengthen gun control. I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe. pierre paul-hus: Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released. justin trudeau: The protection, the safety and the health of all Canadians are important for the government. This is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected. We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. pierre paul-hus: So is the Prime Minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience COVID-19 within the walls? right hon. justin trudeau: There are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released. Is Canada going to stand by its allies in the Five Eyes and demand that the Chinese government be completely transparent? right hon. justin trudeau: We continue to stand in solidarity with our allies, including the Five Eyes, as they have stood in solidarity with Canada in terms of the two Canadians who have been unjustly detained for a long time in China. In the coming months and years, we expect to obtain answers to all our questions about the origin of this pandemic, including questions that are important for China. At the same time, we are going to work hard to ensure that all Canadians have the equipment and the protection they need to get through this pandemic. yves-franois blanchet (beloeilchambly, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. For some days, discussions have been going on between people from the Bloc Qubcois and people from the government with a view to collaboratively coming up with a proposal for seniors in Quebec and Canada. The gist of our proposal is to temporarily increase the old age security by about $25per week, or $110per month. The discussion has been going on for some time and it's a proposal that we made in the election campaign. Given that impatience, I realized I should not be the one answering them, it should be the Prime Minister. So here is my question for the Prime Minister: what are you doing to seek a solution that will increase the purchasing power of seniors in Quebec and Canada in the very short term? right hon. justin trudeau: Clearly, seniors need support and significant services from us because of COVID-19. Our priority was to implement income replacement benefits for workers who have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. The most vulnerable seniors are going to receive reimbursement of the GST, which will help them very quickly. We have also channelled $9million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors. I am very pleased that we have been able to work with other parliamentarians, including those in the Bloc Qubcois, to hear these concerns and to find the best way to help seniors in the short term. In terms of the pandemic, they have concerns about their physical security, but also about their financial security. yves-franois blanchet: In the last few hours, the Prime Minister has indicated that he could need the cooperation of other parties, including the Bloc Qubcois, on a completely different matter. We are very open to that discussion, but we want the same openness when we are asking for something to serve the people of Quebec. Seniors in my constituency, as in any other of the 338constituencies, are asking what we are doing. When will there be something for them? I want to be able to give them an answer of some kind. justin trudeau: There will be announcements in the coming days on the way in which we will be able to help seniors, particularly the most vulnerable seniors. There are horror stories, whether about the CHSLDs, or about our most vulnerable seniors across the country. There are seniors who are alone, seniors who are afraid of falling ill without ever seeing their grandchildren or their children again. We have to be there for those who belong to that great generation that fought for us during the second world war. Chair, every day I hear from people who are struggling to pay their bills and to keep a roof over their head. Instead of making sure that Canadians get the help they need, the government has created complicated programs that are still letting people fall through the cracks. If the Prime Minister won't commit to a universal benefit, will he at least commit to removing the restrictive eligibility criteria that are leaving the most vulnerable people behind? right hon. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. That is why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. However, because she didn't make $5,000 last year, when the pandemic hit she didn't qualify for any benefits. Chair, our focus throughout this crisis has been on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures that will lift Canadians out of poverty and will support them. Over the past five years, we've lifted over a million people out of poverty in this country, and we've continued to put the most vulnerable at the heart of everything we're doing. At the same time, we will continue to look for more ways to help even more than the seven million Canadians who successfully receive the CERB. We recognize there's more to do, and we will continue trying to do everything we can in this unprecedented situation. Chair, the government is weirdly committed to eligibility criteria that result in regular people not getting the support they need, but not so committed to criteria for corporations and billionaires who get our help. If a company is cheating the public, using offshore tax havens not to pay its fair share, it should not be eligible for government bailouts or benefits. Other countries, like Poland, Denmark and France, have made this commitment, and if they can do it, so can we. Will he commit now that if a company has money in offshore tax havens, it will not receive public funds? right hon. Chair, the measures we've put forward are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for. It is a shame to hear the NDP, which used to be the party of workers, choosing to judge workers by which multinational they work for. We have moved forward with a wage subsidy such that the employers are obliged to pass every single penny on to the workers. That is help for the workers, and that has been our focus all the way through: ordinary Canadians who need support because they are unable to work because of COVID-19. I want to remind honourable members that we're trying to stay within committee rules, which state that the length of a question and the length of an answer should be approximately the same amount of time. She has about 45 seconds left, and hopefully that's about half and half for the question and the answer. My community was facing a crisis long before the pandemic hit, and now people who are living on the streets or in parks don't have the luxury of following public health advice and just staying home. In Victoria, the province and the municipality have stepped up with solutions to house people, at least for the short term, in local hotels. Will the federal government respond to this immediate crisis and provide the needed investments in long-term, stable housing? the chair: The right honourable Prime Minister, in 25 seconds or less, please. Working with partners, we have reduced poverty by over a million people in this country, but there is more to do. We recognize that during this pandemic there's even more to do for vulnerable Canadians, and we are partnering with orders of government to make sure that happens. jol godin (portneufjacques-cartier, cpc): A point of order, Mr.Chair. Could we please check so that I can hear in French what the Prime Minister is saying? the chair: Okay. I'm speaking English right now and I'm on the English toggle at the bottom of the screen. It does create a bit of a disjoint when we're speaking, but it's the way to get around that so we have interpretation that works for everyone. Chair, as this is our first opportunity to meet in any forum, I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of the brave men and women who lost their lives in the helicopter crash. I know that I speak for all parliamentarians when I extend our sympathy to their families and loved ones. Chair, I want to raise with the Prime Minister an issue that I've raised several times before, and that is a gap in the wage subsidy program. Those companies separately would qualify for the wage subsidy, but because of rules that the government designed, together they do not. Even though collectively they have experienced a massive drop in revenue and would otherwise be eligible, so far they've been unable to get confirmation that they will be able to access the program. Will the Prime Minister be able to deliver some good news to people who work for Brandt Tractor all across the country? right hon. justin trudeau: I thank the honourable member for his question and for his advocacy for his community and businesses in his riding. As I told him when we spoke directly, Finance officials have been directly in contact with the company in his riding. We recognize that there are particular elements in regard to this company that are challenging around application for the wage subsidy, but I know that Finance officials are working very hard to try to make sure that everyone who needs the subsidy gets it, so that the workers in his community can get the support they need. andrew scheer: The Prime Minister knows that there are many companies across the country that fall into this category as well, so we're hoping for some good news. Just flagging the time and date, it is well into May now and important decisions have to be made in very short order. There are other aspects of the government's plans to help get people through this crisis that are also causing people to fall through the cracks. As provinces start to open up, many companies are going to be faced with a very difficult decision of operating at perhaps 35% or 45% of regular revenues. They will not be able to access these programs and, in many cases, there is going to be a disincentive to reopen and put people back to work. Will the Prime Minister amend these programs to provide for more flexibility so that more and more Canadians can start to return to work in the weeks ahead? right hon. Chair, we are in an unprecedented crisis and we had to move quickly to support workers and to support families across the country, and that's exactly what we did. We're going to continue to work to try to respond to the reality that people and businesses are facing right across the country. I am eager to be faced with the challenge of how to ease off in these measures so that people can get back to work. We are still focused very much on giving the supports to workers and families that are so necessary in this time of crisis. As different provinces move forward towards reopening, as we look at different paths forward, I know that I will be able to count on all members in the House and, indeed, on Canadians from coast to coast to coast to figure out together what the best way will be to move forward on keeping us safe and restoring economic activity in the right way. the chair: We have about a minute left for maybe a 30-second question and a 30-second answer. The problems with them have been flagged for the government for weeks as well, but we're also going to see an additional challenge, where people who are receiving the emergency response benefit, who may have the option to go back to work and work some hours, are faced with a hard cap of $1,000 a month before they lose the CERB. Conservatives are proposing a progressive system, a more flexible system, where people will be able to earn more without losing their benefits as businesses ramp up but before normal working hours are restored. Again, will the Prime Minister build in some flexibility to lift the restrictive ceiling on what people can earn before losing benefits so that it always pays more to work? the chair: I believe the timer is telling all of us that the time is up, but I'll give the right honourable Prime Minister about 30 seconds to answer that, please. Our priority was getting support for Canadians right across the country with the CERB, with the wage subsidy and with other measures for students, for seniors, for farmers and for agricultural producers. We are going to work with communities and with industry as we look to reopen, to make sure that people have opportunities to work and are not penalized for it. However, our overarching priority was allowing Canadians to be confident in their ability to stay home, care for their loved ones, buy groceries and pay their rent so that we could keep safe during this pandemic. We've heard the Prime Minister admit that fixed incomes for some of them are down, rent is increasing and the price of groceries is increasing. Chair, after a lifetime of hard work, of course Canadians deserve peace of mind when it comes to their retirement security. Happily, their pensions and their benefits are still flowing, unlike for so many of those who have lost their jobs, but it's still tough. People received a GST credit, a supplementary payment that was $400 on average for single seniors and $600 for couples. I think you had reminded us as members that the amount of time for the answer should be similar to the amount of time for the question. the chair: I want to remind all honourable members to keep their answers as well as their questions as concise as possible. We see a number of inconsistencies in what is considered essential travel with regard to the U.S. While we have Americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish, individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined. We have people who have purchased masts from Canadian producers for their boats, and who want to come and pick them up, who are not being allowed to do that. When will they clarify the rules to the CBSA agents so that essential travel and trade and commerce, including individual commerce, is understood? hon. Chair, we have implemented very rigorous rules that have been well documented and understood by CBSA to stop all non-essential travel. At the same time, we recognize the importance of maintaining essential supply routes so that goods and services could reach Canada and we could put groceries on our shelves. The work we are doing to stop non-essential travel has been important for the health and safety of Canadians, and we will continue with that work. We see that many of them are not eligible for any of the benefit packages that have been rolled outEI, CERB, the wage subsidy, etc. What is the government going to do to address sole proprietors who are currently falling through the cracks? hon. Chair, first, let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult. The intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge.",
        " We are looking at ways that we can ensure that the Canada emergency business account has the broadest possible application. We are looking at ways we can consider that eligibility process, recognizing that we need to make sure that the program continues to have its desired impact, and we will have more to say on that. Since then the minister has overruled the will of harvesters in Prince Edward Island and in the gulf who voted to start their seasons on time, but she has allowed harvesters from her own riding to proceed with their seasons as scheduled, giving them access to markets weeks before their competitors. This double standard is severely unfair and Atlantic harvesters are furious, as demonstrated during the protests on the Canso Causeway yesterday. When will the minister stop abusing her position and start respecting fish harvesters by opening up lobster fishing areas 23, 24 and 26? hon. Chair, when making decisions with regard to when seasons open, a number of factors are taken into account. They are complex decisions that take into account what is necessary for processors to be ready for the season, what is necessary for harvesters to be ready for the season, as well socio-economic impacts on the area. In the decisions we've made around the gulf, one of the main things we heard from all of those areas is that it was very important for them to start on the same date. Maybe I'll start muting if it's necessary, but interrupting is not going to solve anything. West coast fishing tourism is a key economic driver in British Columbia, especially in coastal communities, and yet the public fishery gets no respect from the government. A year later, the fisheries minister refuses even to discuss viable, science-based solutions to conserve B.C.'s public fisheries. Does the minister and her government have a will and a plan to support Canada's west coast fisheries and the communities they sustain? the chair: The hon. That's why we continue to work with those communities and with the fisheries to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to support them. During these extremely difficult times, we're working on measures with the fishery in B.C., as well as on the Atlantic coast and eastern Quebec, to make sure that we're delivering for them and that all of the issues they're having are being addressed. Chair, Canada's seniors, especially those on basic incomes, are being hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis as they face new rising costs and scarcity of services. Seniors require adequate caregiver supports, physical safety and freedom to access their savings to reinforce their financial security. Why has the government failed to recognize the increasing challenges that seniors are facing? Will the government support Canada's senior citizens? the chair: The hon. We have provided a GST credit supplement of $400 for single seniors and $600 for couples, for low- and modest-income seniors. We have also ensured that the Canada emergency response benefit is there for seniors who have lost income due to COVID-19. On April 23, my colleagues and I called on the government to create a program that would match students seeking employment with employers in Canada's essential food supply chains. What has the government done to match students and other Canadians seeking employment with employers in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, including those in the fish and seafood sector? hon. Chair, we're doing all we can to make sure, using our existing employment programs, that we create opportunities for students to work and get work experience this summer. We know that this is going to be really tough, especially in areas like agriculture, so we have dedicated streams for agriculture sector employers to access students with help from the government, and a number of different initiatives including Canada summer jobs, which I'm really excited to see the results of in the coming days. Arnold, it's the second time that I note you've threatened to cut off a Conservative microphone. I'm just wondering, given that this isn't the House of Commons and it's structured as a committee, what standing order would give you the right to cut off a member of Parliament using a mute button. It seems a little dictatorial, and I was just wondering whether you could clarify that, based on the Standing Orders. the chair: I don't think I threatened to use mute, but thank you for bringing that up. I am trying to keep the rules where the questions and the answers are equal, so that there are no interruptions on either side. Bring the papers with the actual verbiage on it where I threatened, and we'll go over it, but I don't think this is the venue to do that. rachael harder (lethbridge, cpc): Canadians have outrightly expressed outrage and disappointment with the government's initiative to put a gun ban in place. Does the minister stand by his comment that these changes would have prevented the tragedy in Nova Scotia? the chair: The honourable minister in 15 seconds or less, please. bill blair: We have heard from health professionals, women's rights organizations, victims groups and the police and our unions. They're all very supportive of the government's measure to ban weapons that have no place in a civil society and were designed to kill people. rachael harder: It's interesting that the minister is misleading Canadians in that comment because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has actually said that a gun ban will do nothing of the sort, that it actually will not protect Canadians. How many criminals will see guns seized because of the changes that have been implemented by the Liberal government? hon. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles. The chief in Toronto said that taking those assault rifles off the streets contributes to public safety, and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs has declared that military assault rifles are produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and they urged successive governments to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles. Absolutely no criminals will see their guns seized based on the Liberals' legislation that's coming forward because it actually goes after those who legally own and use their firearms. Can the Prime Minister please tell us why he decided to go after law-abiding citizens instead of actually going after criminals who have gotten their firearms in an illegal manner and then used them to commit crimes? the chair: The honourable minister in 25 seconds or less, please. bill blair: Yes, to be very clear, the order in council actually is targeted at weapons, weapons that were designed for military use, and in their design and in their intent, to kill people, they've actually been used in this country, at cole Polytechnique; in Moncton; at a Quebec City mosque; in Fredericton; at Mayerthorpe and most recently in Nova Scotia. They are being used and have been used in Canada and around the world to commit mass murder, and in the interest of public safety and at the urging the chair: We'll go on to Ms. Now I understand the Prime Minister has his food prepared for him at 24 Sussex Drive and then it's delivered to him at the cottage where he lives. Now, they're in a crisis right now, which means that regular Canadians are actually at risk of not having food available for them at the grocery stores where they purchase theirs. Why doesn't the Prime Minister care about the women and the men who work incredibly hard to keep Canada fed? hon. chrystia freeland (deputy prime minister and minister of intergovernmental affairs): Mr. member that our government cares very, very much about the women and men who work so hard to feed our country. Let me just say I am grateful to all the farmers, like my dad, who are out in their fields right now getting ready for seeding. We, as Canadians, are lucky to be citizens of an agricultural superpower, and our government believes in supporting our farmers and ranchers. rachael harder: I'm confused as to why the Prime Minister didn't take my question, and at a bare minimum as to why the agriculture minister doesn't feel it's important enough for her to be a part of this discussion today. When we have farmers who produce for Canadians on a daily basis and they're asking some serious and some very important questions, and we don't even have a minister who's willing to come to the table and engage in this conversation, that's shameful. Several meat-packing plants have been forced to shut down because of COVID-19 and, as a result, farmers are forced to hold stock longer than expected. Cattle producers in my region are spending more than $60,000 a day to keep their livestock fed while they wait for processing plants to reopen. When will the government take this seriously and at least implement a set-aside program for those who are beef producers in Canada? hon. Chair, let me just say that I feel there is nothing shameful at all in having me, the Deputy Prime Minister, answer questions about agriculture. I am actually very proud to speak up for Canada's amazing farmers, for our country's amazing ranchers, for our amazing pork producers and our poultry producers. james bezan (selkirkinterlakeeastman, cpc): Thank you, Mr. I too would like to express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the six military heroes who lost their lives at sea last week. I'm sure that all members of the House stand shoulder to shoulder with the families, with the crew of the HMCS Fredericton and, indeed, with the entire Canadian Armed Forces community during this time of grief. Can the Minister of National Defence give us an update as to the Cyclone helicopter crash off the coast of Greece last week? hon. Our number one priority is to make sure that we look after them, and that's exactly what we are doing. I actually spoke with the Italian minister of defence and he promised full support for this investigation and any support that's required. the chair: I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut you off there, if we're going by the rules that were pointed out by the House. I know that back in early January, military intelligence through CF Intelligence Command was reporting, through the chain of command, the novel coronavirus and the outbreak in Wuhan. On what date was he, as Minister of National Defence, given his first intelligence briefing on the outbreak and the pandemic in China? hon. We work with our Five Eyes intelligence sources and this has been a whole-of-government effort, right from the beginning. Obviously, I can't discuss the intelligence in this forum, but I can assure you that our response has been well informed with the correct information. james bezan: Minister Sajjan, we know that intelligence was going up the chain of command in National Defence. It was reported in the media that in early January the hierarchy within the Canadian Armed Forces was being made aware of the coronavirus outbreak. As with all our intelligence, we work together from a whole-of-government perspective with all of our intelligence agencies. One thing I can assure you is that our response has been well informed with all the correct information that is provided to me and other members of cabinet. james bezan: What was that timeline? From the time you were first told, Minister Sajjan, about the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, what did you do with that intelligence? When did you give it to the Prime Minister or to Minister Hajdu as the Minister of Health? hon. Chair, let me say that our government's response to this global pandemic has of course been informed by the excellent work of Canadian intelligence agencies throughout. In January, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the incident response group, and in January we increased screening at all major airports. All of these actions were informed by the work of our excellent intelligence community, and of course our work with our Five Eyes, NATO and NORAD allies. james bezan: I want to come back the chair: We now move to Mr.Ste-Marie. gabriel ste-marie (joliette, bq): Can I go ahead, Mr.Chair? the chair: Yes, go ahead. In an interview with Grald Fillion, tax expert Andr Lareau, who specializes in tax havens, pointed out that $350billion Canadian is parked in just 12tax havens. Mr.Lareau also notes that the government is aware that all of this Canadian money is stashed in tax havens but is doing nothing about it. He said that it's time for Canada to tackle the problem given that it has a $250-billion deficit, and that if it doesn't act now to change things, it never will. diane lebouthillier (minister of national revenue): Mr.Chair, as soon as we took office, in 2015, our government made cracking down on tax evaders in Canada and abroad a priority. I realize that my fellow member is impatient, but he has to understand that this is a very complex issue. Under our leadership, in three years, the Canada Revenue Agency has undertaken twice as many audits related to offshore tax evasion as it did in the 10years the Conservatives were in power. As we speak, the agency is conducting more than 50criminal investigations tied to international tax evasion. gabriel ste-marie: You're right, I am very impatient, because whenever I bring up the fact that companies are using tax havens legally, the minister misses the point and tells me that she is going after fraudsters. Since Parliament began sitting virtually, it's been mentioned a few times that Denmark and Poland have decided to deal with the issue. Even France's finance minister, Bruno LeMaire, said that companies with subsidiaries in tax havens would not be eligible for public assistance. We hear thePrime Minister and other government officials say all the time that the wage subsidies are going to workers, so I'd like to cite another examplebanks. The government is injecting huge amounts of cash into the financial system and repurchasing troubled assets in massive quantities, and yet, the five major banks in Toronto, alone, are continuing to save billions of dollars every year by artificially redirecting their profits to tax havens. This has nothing to do with wages for workers, and everything to do with the repurchase of troubled assets, cash flow and billions of dollars that the government could be going after. Is the government going to seize this opportunity to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal? hon. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, our government is taking unprecedented steps through the Canada emergency wage subsidy measure to support businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. What's more, any employer receiving the subsidy who is deemed ineligible will have to repay the full amount. Anyone who abuses the program could face a fine of up to 225% of the wage subsidy amount and up to five years in prison. the chair: Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds to ask your question, and about the same for the answer. Although completely immoral, the use of tax havens by companies is legal under section5907 of the Income Tax Regulations. We are going to have a $250-billion deficit to pay off, and everyone is going to have to chip in, including the rich who are currently taking advantage of the system. diane lebouthillier: Mr.Chair, thanks to a historic billion-dollar investment, our government has given the agency the resources it needs to do the job, and we are starting to see results. I'm proud of how the Government of Canada has been beside Canadians through every step of this pandemic and has supported Canadians when they needed it most. In BonavistaBurinTrinity and across our country, our commercial fishery has seen many challenges and impacts. Last week, my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing Canada's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process, store, package and distribute healthy, high-quality products on to the plates of Canadians. The fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures. Chair, I want to thank my colleague from BonavistaBurinTrinity for keeping us well aware of what's happening in his riding with harvesters and with processors. It's the backbone and the lifeblood of our communities and that's why we want to be there to support them. We've already taken steps by making sure that the CERB is now able to be accessed by people who are seasonal workers. As well, we are making sure that people who are running out of fishers EI are also able to qualify for it. We also have made an investment of $62.5 million to support our processors to make sure they are able to be ready for the challenges that they are going to face because of COVID-19. We are working with our partners across industry to make sure we're hearing what their major concerns are. We will have more to say about that and what we will be able to do in the coming days. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all the chair: We have a point of order. damien kurek (battle rivercrowfoot, cpc): Sorry, but there seems to be an issue with the audio. Chair, in my riding of SurreyNewton, I'm in close contact with businesses that represent all vantage points in the supply chainfrom manufacturers to retailers, transport companies to warehousing. With provinces and territories moving at different speeds and implementing different protocols for reopening the economy, there is a lot of confusion in my local business community on the timing and logistics of how this will happen. With so many different parts of the supply chain operating in different jurisdictions, and with each business serving unique roles on this spectrum, how can the federal government serve to best coordinate with the provinces and territories so that the supply chain can be implemented smoothly as we embark on our economic recovery? hon. One of the most important things the federal government can do when it comes to the reopening of the Canadian economy is to work in close collaboration with the premiers of the provinces and territories. That's why I was so pleased that last week the Prime Minister, together with all the first ministers of the country, was able to issue a statement around the principles that will be guiding our entire country as we move towards a restart. This is so important because, as my colleague has pointed out, all of our business, our economic activity, happens across the country. We have been able to work together in fighting coronavirus, and we are going to work together in the future to keep on fighting coronavirus and to reopen Canada. In Alberta, meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 cases. The government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with COVID-19. Now, two workers are dead, at least six more are in intensive care and COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities. On March 27, regarding the CERB, the Minister of Finance said that if workers don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, they can apply for the benefit, yet the website says differently. Will the minister guarantee that every Canadian receiving CERB, EI or the CESB will not lose their benefits if they refuse to return to work or to accept work that is unsafe due to COVID-19? hon. chrystia freeland: Let me thank the member, first of all, for her really very important question. I think all of us share the concern for Canada's essential workers who are keeping us safe, putting food on our tables and often working in difficult conditions. When it comes to the Cargill plant, this is an issue that our government has been very closely engaged in. My colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has spoken with her provincial counterpart and the head of the plant. To the question my colleague asked about workers, it is absolutely the case that no Canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe, and it is also very much the case that any Canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home. This is the way that collectively we take care of ourselves and we take care the chair: We will go on to Ms. heather mcpherson: I just want to be clear, because I'm not a hundred per cent sure that I got an answer in that response, so I'll try one more time. Knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work, can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work, they will be able to access the CERB, or was the Minister of Finance incorrect when he spoke on March 27? the chair: The honourable minister. chrystia freeland: In a time of coronavirus that is even more the case, and the government of course should not penalize workers for doing the right thing and declining to go to work in unsafe conditions. the chair: I want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the Chair to avoid back and forth, just to try to keep some order in the meeting. If the provincial government won't shut down the plant, will the federal government shut down unsafe plants through the Canadian Food Inspection Agency? hon. Chair, on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, let me be very clear that my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, has been in touch with provincial authorities. The duties of the food inspection agency, of course, are to ensure that the food produced at the plant is safe. We are working closely with provincial authorities and with health authorities to ensure that the chair: We will go back to Ms. Can the finance minister please let us know if Cargill, a company that is owned by billionaires, with business in Luxembourg, a known tax haven, has received any federal funding this year for COVID-related support? hon. diane lebouthillier: This is a tough time for Canadians, and our government is doing everything it can to support them. More than 7million Canadians have applied for the Canada emergency response benefit, which the Canada Revenue Agency and Service Canada administer. I want to say how proud I am of the work the agency is doing; staff worked tirelessly to get the program up and running in record time. richard bragdon (tobiquemactaquac, cpc): Thank you, Mr. Potato farmers in New Brunswick and across Canada are sitting on massive stores of potatoes that were destined for the restaurant industry, but due to the pandemic, they now have no customers. What is the Prime Minister's plan for the helping farmers offload these potatoes so that they are ready for the 2020 season? hon. We are aware that the coronavirus, by keeping us away from restaurants where we eat french fries, has had a profound effect on the market for potatoes. The program announced today by the Prime Minister and my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be very helpful for potato farmers, including with the surplus food program that starts with a $50 million fund, and that the chair: We'll go back to Mr. With an estimated $300 million worth of potatoes in storage, the announced funding from the government today simply doesn't go far enough. How does the Prime Minister plan to mitigate these shortfalls and allow farmers to continue to grow the food we so desperately need? hon. The program today is $252 million, which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers, of course, have access to. On potato farmers, in particular, I agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern. I think all Canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used, and that's why the $50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful. The $16-billion beef industry is expected to take a massive hit due to the closures and reduced production of the meat-packing plants. Does the government truly believe that the announced $125 million that is shared between beef, poultry and pork producers will be enough to support these multi-billion dollar industries so they can put food on the tables of Canadians? hon. Chair, I absolutely agree with the honourable member that our beef, pork and poultry producers are absolutely essential for our country. I am very pleased as a Canadian that we have security that comes from being a country that produces not only enough food for ourselves, but also enough food to feed the world. That is why the $125 million specifically to support our beef, pork and poultry producers is going to be so helpful. Chair, the government's announcement of $252 million for the agriculture sector falls well short of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's request for immediate government relief for farmers. The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Mary Robinson, put it today something like this: that if the farmhouse is on fire, the government has offered the equivalent of a bucket of water. Does the government have a plan to offer more than just crumbs to keep the vital agriculture sector operating and providing the food we so desperately need? When will the government finally make those who literally keep our land and grow our food a priority in this time of crisis? hon. Chair, I don't know about the honourable member, but where I come from, $252 million is not just crumbs. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two other aspects of the essential support for farmers that we announced today: the $77 million to support food processors, which will not only be important for the processors, but helpful for the farmers who produce products that go to them; and the $250 million that we would like to add to the Canadian Dairy Commission's line of credit to raise it to half a billion dollars, which will be very helpful to our essential dairy farmers. Chair, a couple in my riding has had to shut down their business, and they are on CERB.",
        " They were shocked when their 16-year-old son also qualified, and he is receiving $8,000 on the basis of part-time work throughout the school year. Why is the government handing out a windfall to teenagers who are living at home while denying university students and ignoring seniors on fixed incomes? hon. Chair, any individual who has lost work for COVID reasons is eligible for the CERB, regardless of their personal circumstances. If you made $5,000 in the past year and are a resident of Canada, you qualify for the CERB. This is not a matter of differentiating between the personal circumstances of individuals but of acknowledging that many workers in different situations have lost their work or have had their work significantly reduced because of COVID. cathay wagantall: Clearly, high school students would not have the same needs as university students and our seniors who are suffering at this time. The government's own findings on banning handguns and assault firearms state, In all cases the data does not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to reductions in gun violence. Why is the Prime Minister so bent on penalizing law-abiding firearms owners when he should be focusing on funding our CBSA officers first, giving them the resources they need to seize smuggled firearms at our borders? hon. Chair, I note with some interest that when we brought forward legislation in a budget in the last two years to increase the number of officers at the border, the member opposite voted against it. The evidence is overwhelming that these weapons are designed to be used, and have been used, to kill innocent people. Countries that adopt sensible gun policiesplaces like New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdomhave all recognized that there's no place for these weapons in a civil society. There have been far too many people killed with these weapons, and even most recently, to honour and respect the terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, the time to act is now, and we've acted. cathay wagantall: Last week the Minister of Agriculture said, Step by step we are giving our farmers...the tools they need to continue their...work. On April 30, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture called on the minister to create a $2.6-billion fund to maintain food security in Canada. This morning, the Prime Minister announced $252 million, hit-and-miss, across the agriculture sector. With all due respect, this is a slap in the face to our farmers and the agri-food sector. If the deputy minister is going to answer the question in her place, how does she see it is right to be providing $9 billion to students and only crumbs to our agriculture sector? hon. Chair, first of all, let me say I do not, as has now been suggested by two members opposite, consider it in any way shameful that I should be answering questions about our support for the agricultural sector. The $252 million of support is real and meaningful, and it is directed exactly where it is needed. As to the question about students, let me just point out that farm kids are students too, and farm kids will be benefiting from the support for students. Meat packing plants like Quebec-based Olymel are extremely worried that they won't be able to stay open throughout the pandemic. In the summer, these plants rely on students to do overtime and fill in for full-time employees on vacation. However, the Canada emergency student benefit makes it possible for these much-needed workers to stay home while still collecting the same amount of money. That's why the government must adjust its current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors. carla qualtrough: I can assure you that we are doing our best efforts to not disincentivize work. We are looking at ways we can create additional jobs through Canada summer jobs, through the the chair: There is a point of order. claude debellefeuille (salaberrysurot, bq): Mr.Chair, what the minister is saying is not being interpreted. carla qualtrough: Last week, as part of the measures announced around supporting our students, we announced the creation of 76,000 additional jobs, including jobs in the agriculture and processing sectors. This is exactly what we're doing through our youth employment and skills strategy, and that's what we'll continue to do. richard lehoux: I'm not sure the minister understood my question about the Canada emergency student benefit. I am very concerned about the agricultural sector, but the tourist and horticultural sectors are also on my mind. A number of business owners in my riding have reached out to me because the shortage of student workers is forcing them to shut down for the summer. Minister, what do you have to say to those business owners in the tourist and horticultural sectors whom you are not helping? hon. We've heard very clearly from the students that they want to work and want to serve in their communities in this time of crisis. That's why we're creating additional employment opportunities and an income support mechanism that allows them to work. Pork and beef producers are feeling the impact of the country's shutdown triggered by the pandemic. For the past five years, the government has been saying that the programs to help producers will be improved. When will the government make these changes, including the changes to agristability, and when can producers access them? hon. chrystia freeland: We announced over $77 million in assistance for food processors to help them protect their workers and deal with the costs associated with the coronavirus. To help livestock and pork producers, we established agrirecovery, a national initiative that will provide $125million to help producers adapt to market changes. The measures announced at noon today received a very cold reception from the entire agriculture and agri-food sector, since the sector had asked for about $2.6billion. I think that it's important to support our agri-food industry and our farms, given the significant need for sovereignty. Many Canadians in the agriculture and agri-food sector have made this clear, as I was saying earlier. chrystia freeland: Our country, Canada, will never depend on its neighbours or any other country for food. I want to mention another significant part of our announcement today, which is the $50million surplus food purchase program. alexandra mends (brossardsaint-lambert, lib.)): We'll now move on to the next question. blaine calkins (red deerlacombe, cpc): Madam Chair, how will the government's forced confiscation of law-abiding firearms owners' property prevent criminals from illegally acquiring firearms from the United States? hon. bill blair: Madam Chair, in response to that, I would simply remind the member that we have made it very clear that these weapons have no place in civil society, so we have prohibited military-style assault weapons that have been designed to be used to kill people and have been used to kill people. We'll bring forward new authorities, new offences, new penalties to deal with people who smuggle weapons across the border. We're also bringing in new regulations for the storage of weapons to make it more difficult for people to steal these guns. To deal with people who purchase them illegally and sell them illegally, there will be new offences and penalties to make ensure that they face the consequences. blaine calkins: The government previously has said that decisions like classifying firearms should be left to experts. A legal opinion that's already been obtained says that the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun with the choke removed is in excess of 20 millimetres. That is the same firearm that Olympic trap shooters, Olympic skeet shooters, duck hunters and geese hunters all across our country use on a very regular basis. First of all, we have prohibited large-bore weapons, such as grenade launchers, but with reference to the 10-gauge shotgun and the 12-gauge shotgun, I would simply remind the member that the bore of a 10-gauge shotgun is 19.69 millimetres in width and the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun is 18.53 millimetres in width, both of them under the size for prohibition and therefore not covered in the new prohibitions that the government introduced on Friday. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, the opinion is that of one of the foremost experts we have in Canada when it comes to firearms legislation. If the entirety of the barrel length is considered, then the removal of the choke makes that barrel in excess of 20 millimetres. There is no plan for a buyback program in this policy, and law-abiding firearms owners are not able currently to surrender their firearms. Given this, and the fact that law-abiding firearms owners aren't committing any gun violence, what was the government's immediate benefit of making this announcement on May 1? hon. Along with the prohibition that we have put in place, we have also, using the order in council, established an amnesty period, but the amnesty period is non-permissive grandfathering of those weapons. They cannot be used, they can't be taken to the range for shooting, they can't be used for hunting, they can't be sold and they can't be transferred, so we have put in strong measures to ensure that these weapons will not be available for use. We have also put in an amnesty period that will allow us to bring forward the legislation and a budget in order to effect a responsible, safe and effective buyback program to remove these weapons from society. blaine calkins: Madam Chair, since January 1, 2002, any law-abiding citizen who was issued with a firearms licence by the government would have been cross-referenced with a continuous eligibility check 6,695 times up until May 1 of this year. How many times was this most recent mass murderer here in Canada checked against a criminal database since January 2002? hon. bill blair: As the member is probably aware, there is a very extensive investigation currently being conducted into that individual and how he acquired his firearms, and it's not appropriate to discuss that. However, I think what is appropriate is to recognize that the weapons that this individual had available to him are weapons that were not designed for target shooting or hunting purposes or any sporting purposes. In the hands of someone who is intent on mass murder, they represent an unacceptable and deadly risk to Canadians, and that's why we have prohibited them. I'd also remind the member that other countries that have adopted sensible gun control laws, such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, have also implemented very similar bans. I'd like to start by giving my condolences for the crew from the HMCS Fredericton who died, and in particular to the family of Captain Kevin Hagen. Other countries are strongly recommending that all citizens wear masks wherever people gather indoors, including in schools, on public transit and in stores. Taiwan has effectively stopped the spread of the coronavirus by supplying people with masks and installing dispensers of hand sanitizer throughout public spaces. Taiwan started in the top 10 countries affected by COVID-19, and today it is number 119. Will Canada follow Taiwan's example so we can lift the lockdown safely and get Canadians back to work? hon. patty hajdu (minister of health): Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and I thank the member for his question. There's no doubt that masks can play a role in a layered approach to protecting Canadians' health and safety, but as the member has mentioned, there are many other aspects to ensuring that Canadians are safe no matter where they go. Social distancing can provide the most protection, in fact, when you're out in public or you're in another place where there are other people. Tam has said that when physical distancing is not an option, Canadians should consider wearing a mask. I'd like to give a shout-out to Martha and her team, who are doing a fundraiser for the SPCA by making masks for citizens in my riding. Madam Chair, many people are falling through the cracks in the pandemic relief plan, including seniors who face an increase in the cost of living and a loss of retirement investment income. Will the government make the CERB a universal benefit to ensure that all Canadians who need help get help? If not, will the government increase old age security and allow seniors to withdraw funds from their RRSP without penalties so that they can pay their bills? hon. We do recognize that OAS and GIS are very important parts of the retirement income of Canadians, particularly lower-income seniors. The CERB is there for working seniors who have lost income as a result of COVID-19. We've also reduced the mandatory retirement withdrawals by 25%, and we've also spent half a billion dollars to support organizations that assist vulnerable Canadians, including seniors the acting chair (mrs. paul manly: Many small businesses do not meet the eligibility requirements for the various relief programs on offer, particularly sole proprietorships. At the same time, we have large companies in this country that use tax havens and loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of public services. Will the government ensure that the needs of small businesses are met and withhold relief from corporations that use tax havens to avoid paying taxes in Canada? hon. mary ng (minister of small business, export promotion and international trade): I want to thank the hon. That is why we have implemented many measures to help them weather this difficult period in COVID-19. Whether it is a small business loan, a wage subsidy or commercial rent assistance, or just lowering the cost by deferring GST or HST or customs duties, many measures have been put forward to help our small businesses through this very difficult time. As we navigate this pandemic crisis, we are also in the middle of another major crisis: the climate emergency. Will this government develop its economic recovery plan for the pandemic with the climate emergency at the forefront of its planning? the acting chair (mrs. The focus of the government at the present time is on combatting the virus and on steps to start to relax some of the measures that have been taken. As we look forward, we need to learn from the experiences of this crisis as well as look forward to some of the looming crises on the horizon. Climate change is one of those, and we certainly intend to reflect on resilience for the economy as we move forward. niki ashton (churchillkeewatinook aski, ndp): Thank you, Madam Chair. First nations across northern Manitoba and many others across the country have been doing everything possible to keep COVID-19 out of their communities. Many here have implemented strict lockdowns or travel restrictions, but the federal government has done virtually nothing to deal with the chronic issues that have made them vulnerable in the first place, such as overcrowded housing and the lack of hospitals. What is your government doing to support communities in the face of that possibility? Why isn't the government supporting the call for a ventilation centre in Berens River, a hospital in Cross Lake, a hospital in the Island Lake region? If the government couldn't act in time for this first wave of the pandemic, can it at least act in time for a potential second wave? hon. marc miller (minister of indigenous services): Indeed, Madam Chair, one of the reflections we have in coming out of this global pandemic is that we don't want to go into the next one with the same social determinants of health that have made indigenous communities more vulnerable and more susceptible to contracting and then spreading COVID-19. A lot of the historic housing funds that we have mobilized in order to address overcrowding in particular are cold comfort to those communities that are still finding themselves in overcrowded situations. In the staged approach to the epidemic and the onset of COVID-19, there are many measures that Indigenous Services Canada and as a whole of government we will deploy, including surge capacity, increased PPE, and nurses and doctors. Obviously, we are looking for a medical solution to a medical problem, and that is what we will spare no expense or resource to address as indigenous communities continue to face the looming threat of a second wave of COVID-19 as they start to relax some of their confinement procedures. niki ashton: Again, Madam Chair, to the Minister of Indigenous Services, many of us across northern Canada are deeply concerned by the outbreak taking place in northern Saskatchewan, centred in La Loche. Your government says it's committed to doing everything it can to keep first nations safe, yet nothing has been done to support calls for pandemic shutdowns. Will you support first nations in their call for shutdowns during this pandemic to save lives now? hon. Members won't be surprised to know that that number will only increase as the days go on and as we implement aggressive testing and contact tracing. We are working with surrounding first nations and communities and with the Mtis and Dene communities in La Loche to ensure that medical precautions are being put into place and that strict social distancing is being put into effect. This is a situation that is very much evolving minute by minute, and it is something for which we have deployed additional resources, along with Meadow Lake and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority to ensure that there is a health response to a health problem. marc miller: One of the things we see as we see the evolving dynamic and the potential spreads, particularly the fear of clusters as communities, provinces, territories may choose to relax certain measures, is the need to have a more targeted approach as to how the economy reacts and deals with it, particularly in northern and vulnerable communities. This is something for which we will need to have a serious approach, with both the Minister of Natural Resources and also our provincial counterparts, to make sure that we aren't taking hasty measures to reopen the economy while we're trying to protectand this is our most important goalindigenous communities from getting exposed and spreading COVID-19. Hundreds of fishers and their families here in Manitoba who work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation are desperately calling for emergency support. Many are calling on the federal government to also work with them and the FFMC to redirect their product to domestic markets and communities here at home to address the growing food insecurity people are facing. When will your government announce support for inland fishers, including here in Manitoba, and will you work to ensure that their product, healthy fish, can be provided here at home for people who need it? hon. bernadette jordan: Madam Chair, we know that COVID-19 is having extreme impacts on northern first nations communities, especially with regard to fisheries in areas that rely on it for not only their livelihoods but also for the cultural importance. Indigenous harvesters are able to access through the aboriginal financial institutions the $306 million we've put in for support for indigenous small and medium-sized businesses. The funding allows for short-term interest-free loans as well as for non-repayable contributions. We also announced earlier that the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency has made available $15 million in non-repayable support for businesses. We know that there's more that needs to be done to support our first nations communities as well as our harvesters. I don't want to talk about the $1billion that the government used to track down tax cheats. I want to ask the minister why she isn't taking this opportunity to learn from countries that are putting an end to tax avoidance in tax havens, a legal but immoral practice in this day and age. Can she explain why she isn't showing leadership by convincing cabinet to change course and eliminate the legal measure known as tax avoidance, which enables companies to avoid paying taxes and put money in tax havens? hon. diane lebouthillier: MadamChair, as soon as our government took office in 2015, we made it a priority to crack down on tax cheats. Our government's historic investments of almost $1 billion have ensured that the agency can access the necessary resources for its work. claude debellefeuille: MadamChair, does the minister realize that she's being filmed and recorded and that she isn't answering my question? I don't want to talk about cheats. I want to talk about companies that use a legal mechanism to avoid paying taxes and to put their money in tax havens. Can she tell me how many companies legally take advantage of tax avoidance in tax havens? How much money escapes taxation through this legal mechanism? The government could invest this money in its economic recovery post-COVID-19. Regarding tax evasion abroad, our leadership made it possible for the agency to conduct twice as many audits in three years as it conducted in 10 years under the Conservatives. However, I don't understand the government's lack of willingness to eliminate this mechanism, which is legal but completely immoral. The Fdration de la relve agricole du Qubec and the UPA approached the Minister of Finance two weeks ago and still haven't received a response regarding the following issue. As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account. To qualify for these loans, the farms needed a payroll of $20,000 to $1.5million in 2019. Does the Minister of Finance plan to respond to the farmers who want to access the $40,000 in loans? hon. The tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis, yet despite the Prime Minister's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed Canadians who work in tourism, there's still been nothing from this government. I had the chance to talk to many of the leaders in the sector, and clearly there's a lot of anxiety. We also had the chance to work with all the G20 ministers of tourism all together, and we know we have to act the chair: We'll now go back to Mr. Tourism-based communities like the ones in Banff and Canmore, which I represent, are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85% or higher. They also don't qualify for a lot of the programs because they're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from May to October, so they're at risk of losing their entire season. Will the government consider making changes to the programs to make sure that seasonal businesses can get help? What does the government plan to do to help the tourism industry recover after the pandemic? hon. Obviously, the tourism sector has access to many measures, including the CEBA account, the $40,000 account. They will be having access also to funding through the regional development agencies, and we'll be coming up with the details soon. Of course, in my colleague's riding of Banff, which is a fantastic place and a tourism gem, they will have access to the support through WD, western economic diversification. If there are particular cases you would like to raise with me, I would be more than happy to talk to you to see how, on the ground, we can help the tourism operators. It doesn't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they'll have after the pandemic. Another industry that's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry. It's another industry the Prime Minister has promised to help, but there hasn't been anything. The only so-called assistance there's been to help hurting Albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in. Will the Liberal government ever show any concern for Albertans? Will they bring forward a plan to preserve Canadian jobs? Will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of Canadian oil before oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. Chair, the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry. We have the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which covers 75% of an employee's wages for the employer. We have more liquidity for oil and gas companies through new loans of $15 million to $60 million from the Business Development Bank of Canada. We continue to step forward in our response to the impacts of COVID-19 on my province here in Newfoundland and Labrador and on Alberta and Saskatchewan. These three provinces are being hit by two crises at the same time, a crisis of demand for oil and gas on the world markets and of course a crisis of public health with COVID-19. Chair, a lot of these things we're hearing about aren't going to actually help the industry to recover. Maybe what they could do is consider expediting the approval of billions of dollars of private sector projects that would put thousands and thousands of Canadians back to work. Will the government consider looking at ways that we can expedite projects? Will they look at ways that we can encourage the use of Canadian oil before the use of oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia? hon. We have been working with labour, concentrating on workers and concentrating on the companies that support those jobs to make sure that they remain whole and those jobs will be there for those workers. We're particularly proud of our orphan wells program, which was launched by the Alberta government in conjunction with us. I am pleased to inform this House that the uptake on applications for that program is significantly higher than even we expected"

My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time .

Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        " hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .  I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . project manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? user interface: Yes , I think so .  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . I just sent user interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , project manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , user interface: yeah . project manager:  and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . So I would say industrial designer: You said  targ target groups , project manager: yeah ? industrial designer: what does that mean ? project manager: As  who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , user interface:  industrial designer:  okay , 'kay . industrial designer: So are project manager: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on industrial designer: Okay .  so f from the project manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , user interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . So n  with  with regard to the  working design of this   remote control  I've identified  a few basic  components of the remote and  se  from the design , functional design perspective  w I c we can now  know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .  the identification of the components ,  and  since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person  and  from the user interface person . industrial designer: and  basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  so basically  the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  and what are the different processes  and how the parts  communicate with each other .  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .  also  the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features  makes it more comp complex . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing  with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .  also the management wants that  our design should be unique  it so it should incorporate  colour and the slogan  that our company  has it as its standard . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . So if  if this is our energy source and this is a cell ,  it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h  how how to do everything . So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,  which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .  so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do ,  make the chip more complicated  and bigger , basically .  so i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . And  also if we can incorporate  the latest features in our chip design , so that our   remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most  televisions . project manager: Do you have any  i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer: but  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so  I just identified the functional components for that . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some  design issues then I I I would like to continue project manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? user interface: okay , yeah . project manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . project manager: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you user interface: There's just nothing . project manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , user interface: Oh right , right , right ,  project manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . project manager: Now it's coming , industrial designer: It'll come up , it   no signal . user interface: No signal ? Why ? project manager: Maybe again ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now , user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again user interface: This is the problem , but project manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design  just like some some first issues that came up .  'kay , so the method I was  adopting at this point , it's not  for the for the whole  period of the  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . user interface:   my method was  to look at  other  remote controls ,  so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what  functionality they used . And then  after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web  just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what  what the user might desire as additional  functionalities . user interface:  so the findings  were  that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And  w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,  then the user would like to switch the channel  for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then   the other possibility would be that  she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .   I als industrial designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? user interface: okay .   among the findings I found that m m most of the curr  presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities  in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update  actually  we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . industrial designer: user interface: So my personal preferences would be  to keep the  the whole remote control small  just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions  like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .  then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then  other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then ,  for example brightness and  similar functions could be just  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n  more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . user interface: If you have questions project manager: If  that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . user interface: Yeah , and also it's it's  other question is  because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included marketing: project manager: user interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the   video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . industrial designer: project manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? industrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements    we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .  but  so so at this stage ,  how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  in we can completely do away with buttons and  have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But  is is there any   any thoughts on that ? user interface:  well , I think the buttons are still  kind of the most  easy for the user to use , industrial designer: Right . user interface:   what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user industrial designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . user interface: and and  the user just wants to get  get a result  quickly , not to spend time in like  giving several orders  I dunno . user interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other  proposals  . industrial designer:  I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . industrial designer:  i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: try to press project manager: Is it plugged in prop industrial designer: oh , okay , marketing: It's working . marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab  observed remote control use with  a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .  so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and  the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . project manager: marketing:  current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .  I dunno what zapping is , but project manager: It's  switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .  okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , industrial designer: Right .  but project manager: I liked the , I liked the litt marketing: ooh where's it go ? project manager: ooh come back . marketing:  okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . project manager: - , that's the next one along , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like  their importance , you know , project manager: marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , industrial designer: marketing:  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  that they get lost , that the  you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . marketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from  you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , project manager: The remote control . Okay , so   the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages industrial designer: Right . marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . Right ,  sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .  so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but  you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and  , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .  there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . marketing:  okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and  , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . industrial designer: marketing:  and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or industrial designer:  . marketing: not a mobile phone industrial designer: Some kind of a ring , project manager: Keys and things like that , industrial designer: some marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , industrial designer: Right . marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , project manager: marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . I think one of the very interesting things that came up in   Ka Kate Cat Cat's  presentation was   this this issue of   like voice recognition being more popular with  younger people . industrial designer: So if we need to have a target group  then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and  you know , good looking  we are better off targeting a younger audience then  you know , people who are comparatively elderly . marketing: Yeah ,  that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then  th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager: project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer: Right , and project manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . marketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know project manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah , project manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface: you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer: But  still , if if you can go back to that slide and  , how popular was it ? project manager: O oh it's on marketing: Oh , I've unplugged it . marketing: Do you want me to project manager: Here , let me industrial designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh   people between twenty five to thirty five ,  how popular was marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I kn  I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like  , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , project manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and marketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: you don't normally have a car , project manager: usually not a car and all of those things . industrial designer: So you're more likely to b marketing: so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing: No ,  that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , project manager: user interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full project manager: Yeah . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , project manager: But do they user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah user interface: Common , the students yeah , yeah . user interface: yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , industrial designer:  user interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ . marketing: industrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? project manager: marketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . user interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of   marketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . marketing: You know , so  that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . user interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer:  project manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on  m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p  things that Cat pointed out was   how do we go about implementing it ?  and  project manager: marketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like  every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , user interface: An industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , project manager:  . marketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know industrial designer: project manager: marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement  for for a limited user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface: Yeah but   Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager: Yeah , user interface: and  , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: What  user interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this  separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular  in the sense that  a person can say , I want to watch  I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . industrial designer: Yeah , so if  if something like that can be incorporated , marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . industrial designer: some kind of marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . marketing: Yeah , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: and that would be really annoying . user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just  speak into it project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager: So that you can yell at it , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think   the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer:  yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager:  . user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and  not to yell at it from the distance . So  wh another thing  that can be used is that  there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so you can go and press that button and  and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , project manager: project manager: but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , user interface: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface: The major ones , yeah . project manager:  but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning  . project manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break industrial designer: project manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . project manager:  I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . industrial designer: So where exactly is this i project manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . user interface: Did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah in that one , user interface: It's just yeah , yeah . marketing: Oh , so y you want our  PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager: Yeah , that would be great . user interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , project manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . project manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . project manager:  as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . marketing: project manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface:  something conceptual , yeah . project manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that marketing: project manager:  we'll keep keep our options op  ? industrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . user interface: Sorry , but  the next meeting  are we going to have it  right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . project manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . project manager: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? marketing: user interface: Okay , see you ."

        " we will start with the  Manager Expert wi who will talk about  user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . marketing: Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted  into  what users want in this remote control . Oh that's okay , it's jus marketing:  so first of all we what we did is we  conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects .  we put them in a in our  usability laboratory and got them to , you know ,  play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire  to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . So basically  the major things we found out was that  basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .  they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we  did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .  they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ .  and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we  tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that  are on remote controls .  so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics  based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .  and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , while the user's watching T_V_ . industrial designer: project manager: marketing:  the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button ,  which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , all the other , all the other  buttons , such as ch  audio and picture selection  configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour .  we also asked users  which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,  note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance .  and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that  w the audio and picture settings were very  weren't very important to them  , and they used them very infrequently a as well . And fifty percent of the users said that  what frustrates them is losing the remote control  somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .  they also said that it  it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface .  and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and  cause u repetitive strain injury . We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition  is a useful feature to have on a remote control . project manager: marketing:  basically our findings are that  amongst a younger age groups  the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . industrial designer: marketing:  for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas  the the trend was as users as users  became older and older  they were less likely to want these sort of features in a  in a remote control .  and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics ,  I think we're focusing on the younger younger  target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . project manager: So ,  maybe now we can talk about a user interface and  about the technical function of this device . So  Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? industrial designer: Well , okay , yeah . marketing: Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , industrial designer: marketing: so it's industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . Okay , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for  , for sending some commands by some waves to  another device to to tell different commands  with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .  first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits  making interface with  keyboard and  r reading  keyboard and reading the keyboard  commands . And then there should be  an electronic circuit making  electronic signals according to these commands and  finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making  making  waves to transmit through the air and   this air this  wave  will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to  r to realise the command . Okay ,  about what I found about  different  these different blocks are  , usually there are two different methods  to for designing a remote control . This is  this can be   the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . And  also as  I understood , and  I think it was a part of  Bob ,   presentation , people prefer to have  to have  the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having  some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the  on the remote control . And  personal preferences ,     certainly a remote control with  working with radio waves is  preferred because  you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . marketing: Do you think radio waves  will interfere with other appliances in the home ? user interface: I don't think so , because  we can make  we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . project manager: So can we use any any frequency ? industrial designer: Yeah , it should be okay . project manager: We have the right to use any frequency ? user interface:  no but as I know , there is a range for  for this  f for for  for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our  transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . And what happen with  radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ? user interface:  for this I'm not  I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting  p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it project manager: Okay . A kind of identification , user interface: Yeah , identification code inside the industrial designer: Yeah f  I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . So industrial designer: It's  kind of handshaking , when starting to  when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . So industrial designer: So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . A specific  remote control has a specific f industrial designer: Yeah but we we don't have to think  about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made  circuits which we probably bu buy . I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this   in this company .  what  I have to do ? A look at what the other company Okay so  presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because  I didn't work  with these  circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And  I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .  , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but  so far I I was  looking what what are the blue circuit ,  radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , marketing: So , I know that  the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can  you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , user interface: industrial designer: but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the  infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends  on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , user interface: industrial designer: because the speech rec Yeah ? marketing: Are we  are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? industrial designer: No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , project manager: industrial designer: so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . industrial designer: But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm project manager: Or it would be maybe feasible ? industrial designer: Oh . But if we use the L_C_D_  even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and  related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . industrial designer: It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , project manager:  . industrial designer: I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know ,  want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . And  my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view  of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . project manager: Why ? Because it's simpler ? industrial designer: Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . industrial designer: Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . marketing: What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ? project manager: industrial designer: Well , three to three to five . marketing: Or ten times more expensive ? Or industrial designer: N not ten times , marketing: Okay . marketing: because  all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . project manager: Well I , oh industrial designer: Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . project manager: we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . marketing: But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . project manager: So  I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . And  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .  the second thing is  they suggest that that we should  use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and  because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control .  ,  It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is  , we put fashion of in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So ,  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this  on this remote control . industrial designer: Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . project manager: Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? industrial designer: You should probably speak . Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?  those nine plus one or two ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: I think it would be a b industrial designer: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . project manager: On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's marketing: Yeah , I user interface: Yeah . project manager: Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like user interface: Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . project manager:  industrial designer: Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . Maybe we could have key buttons , like  discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and industrial designer: You mean like hierarchical structure . project manager: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . industrial designer: So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you project manager: Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . marketing: We could maybe also c  incorporate Petre's idea of the  slider for the volume , with the channel . industrial designer: So we are still s speaking about the common devices user interface: industrial designer: or we are inviting the new one ? marketing: I think so . project manager: What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . user interface: we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this    ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can industrial designer: On the screen , you mean ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: And then marketing: I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones .  this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ user interface: W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . industrial designer: Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . project manager: So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but user interface: Yeah . marketing: But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . marketing:  there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some project manager: Yeah . marketing: So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . project manager: In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . industrial designer: Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally project manager: It's it's a kind of setting , I think . marketing: well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . project manager: No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer industrial designer: Yes . Well I I  project manager: I I think , no ? industrial designer: marketing: But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . marketing:  based on our usability studies again ,  pe  people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . marketing: you know , it was nine out of ten industrial designer: Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep  keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , marketing: re relevance . industrial designer: we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Because , well it's maybe question for you t marketing: I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , user interface: marketing: which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . marketing:  and all the other f functionality is industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . industrial designer: Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . user interface: industrial designer: Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be project manager: For what ? industrial designer:  power button . marketing: I think it should be a bu industrial designer: If it if it's a button or user interface: Yeah . marketing: S What about things like the clock and  timers ? industrial designer: Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder . Well what w what was the question ? user interface: Clock or marketing: you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display project manager: Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . industrial designer: Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: no ? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ?  , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? user interface:  . project manager: W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . industrial designer: Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , user interface: project manager: industrial designer: well And based on your user interface: marketing: Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . industrial designer: marketing: But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but user interface:  . industrial designer: Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . industrial designer: user interface: And  do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: I think user interface: I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to  put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . project manager: So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time "

        "industrial designer: 'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Okay , well marketing: It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . project manager: Well how  on the in this meeting then if we  I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . project manager: and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories ,  . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the  corporate colour and slogan .  so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . project manager: And so if we start off  with Andrew and then Craig and then David , marketing: Okay .  what did  how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? industrial designer: Oh I should also point out that  the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .  basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it  too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . marketing: And  and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .  so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify  trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our  p project plan that we have so far , and then  initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other  other elements of the of the project . marketing: I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this . marketing: Okay so out of  different  figures and ratings ob  of people in general ,  consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that  the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel ,  b f f fancy . marketing:  however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary  sort of functional bits to it .  and third priority  for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be ,  quite user friendly while still having technology . So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think  what we should think about is how the  about how the innovation  contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . marketing: For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what  , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative project manager: -huh . So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . marketing: Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market  research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority .  top European fashion trend  that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , industrial designer: project manager: marketing: especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought  , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , project manager: Okay okay . marketing: do you know what  ? So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .  'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer ,  so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , project manager: marketing: I think that would be pushing it . industrial designer: marketing: And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So  probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour .  innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be  cutting edge ,  but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours  that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , project manager: marketing: something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . marketing: You know what a Mac iPod is ? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have .  and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more  techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a I dunno like  we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on ,  sorta like a marketing identity . So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . marketing: Like  the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like  like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and project manager: Okay . marketing: I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly  into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like  like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it  lights up , q usually the buttons light up . marketing: How can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . marketing: but  hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into project manager: -huh .  there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there ,  so I've taken the  suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this  So then this we're looking for  suggestions on size th  size of control and the buttons ,  the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . user interface:  what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .  they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost .  they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them .  I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for .  there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control  I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that  The buttons should be large .  one of the examples given on the homepage was  there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , project manager: user interface: so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing .  if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . user interface:  obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could  tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ? project manager: I think it's yellow marketing: I didn't know . project manager: because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , marketing: Okay . user interface: any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the  shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . user interface:  if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section  making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or  we should definitely avoid the big square block look . user interface: And  we got an email  from I think it's the the research department , and they've said th the voice control  can now talk back if you ask it a question . user interface: So it sh it could be good to have them  confirm any action you take project manager: Aye that's a good idea , yeah .  you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or marketing:  . marketing: It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , project manager: I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . project manager: Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this  industrial designer: Yeah okay . project manager: marketing: It takes a second , doesn't it ? industrial designer: 'Kay , that should be it . marketing: industrial designer: So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process ,  and then you can just work through it marketing: industrial designer: and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch  depending on what your needs are . industrial designer:  I think , like what you guys said ,  the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface .  like you said time to market was a problem ,  and how many components are physically in there in cost .  and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared ,  they affect you in terms of the size of your device ,  and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than  the actual use using the the remote control because  like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .  these are the options that are available to you ,  I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . industrial designer:  it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . industrial designer: well I could see the other email that they sent you ,  'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons , user interface: Right . industrial designer: okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , project manager:  . industrial designer: okay there's an L_C_D_ display , marketing: industrial designer:  I think these are quite standard things . marketing: They're standard , aren't they ? industrial designer: No  they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . It can actually be flat or it can be curved ,  and then the different types of materials that you can use ,  I don't think you can use them in a combination ,  but  project manager: industrial designer: I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . project manager: We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? industrial designer:  I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium . industrial designer:  the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , project manager:  'kay . industrial designer: but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so I think that there is some restriction on  I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , project manager: industrial designer: but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . industrial designer:  and the other components are logic chips ,  again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit  and that impacts cost .  I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up you know , a crank . industrial designer: Yeah but that that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . industrial designer: which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . user interface: industrial designer: So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . industrial designer:  and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one project manager: industrial designer: because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . industrial designer: From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , marketing: industrial designer: it's a shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . industrial designer: you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , project manager:  yeah yeah , I see . project manager: marketing: industrial designer: you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . industrial designer: You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: my from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think  something comfortable to hold ,  small and slim marketing: industrial designer: I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . industrial designer:  and the other thing is from a production point of view  the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . industrial designer:  The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . industrial designer: Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that  , marketing: industrial designer: titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . industrial designer: Okay  there's no restriction on the plastic , and marketing: It can't be curved . industrial designer: So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination ,  especially the titanium project manager: Okay . Right can I marketing:  question on can I ask a question ? project manager: Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away . Can we  power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? industrial designer:  I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light project manager:  . industrial designer: so that marketing: So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . project manager: Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? marketing: Well  I'm thinking it might be That for  this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it project manager: -huh . marketing: and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? industrial designer: Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of  a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive .",
        " Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you  you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , industrial designer: Okay . marketing: and  y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . marketing: We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . industrial designer:  that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch project manager:  . marketing: But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? industrial designer:  it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . industrial designer: like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the marketing: Right . project manager: let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . So  yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . project manager: So back to your idea about  incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . project manager: Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ?  that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? user interface:  I think we could go for like  maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . project manager: So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or user interface:  probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . Colour-wise  you made a re  was it you or  I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that industrial designer: I think he made that . project manager: Whose user interface: marketing: What's that ? project manager: about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . project manager:  and when the corporate colour is yellow ,  maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . project manager: And then obviously the  the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? That's all . marketing: Well  I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , project manager: marketing: and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is  the look and feel . marketing: So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize .  maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the  the colour , project manager:  if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , project manager: marketing: what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the project manager: Okay . industrial designer: Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? marketing: industrial designer: Does it need with a square thing wha project manager: Oh you know like in circular in shape or industrial designer: Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of marketing: Yeah . project manager: 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , user interface: See I'm project manager: and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so  Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or marketing: No no no not at all . marketing: It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . project manager: Okay right well  marketing: Do you know what  ? project manager: so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . project manager: A snowman shape ? user interface:  so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . That's quite a distinctive shape , marketing: Right , project manager: that would be good marketing: sure . project manager: so yeah should we go with that ? marketing:  can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a project manager: Do you wanna draw it on the board ? user interface: marketing: Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it . user interface:  something like that  you got two groups there  maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside project manager: Ooh that'd be good .  and  colour-wise what does everybody think ? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . user interface: So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had  this here , had a sorta background yellow , marketing: project manager: -huh .  and also  how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? The fact that it talks to you ,  it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . project manager: I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? user interface: I think that'd probably scare me .  unless an a  if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate  an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Would we put that on the inside or industrial designer: Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? user interface:  industrial designer: What what's the functionality of that ? project manager: It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . industrial designer: Yeah but the question is what are we using it marketing: What would it achieve ? industrial designer: what would we what would we achieve from it ? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a marketing: Well L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with  listings . marketing: So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , marketing: Right , okay . industrial designer:  I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but  it's what's what what would it tell the user , project manager: I think that would make it very complex . industrial designer: 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as  as opposed to an input so  does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? project manager: Yeah . marketing:  not real industrial designer: We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? marketing: project manager: I don't know if there is really , marketing: project manager: no  industrial designer:  project manager: I would say no need for a talk-back . project manager: so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities ,   do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? user interface:  well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . user interface: B  I think the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . project manager: Okay right  what else do you need to talk about ? marketing: Well i I was just industrial designer: Where would you physically position the buttons ?  I think that that has some impact on on on many things . project manager: So I'm just gonna  pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about .  energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , marketing: Yeah , sure . project manager:  what does anybody think about that ? marketing:  I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , industrial designer: No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just marketing: and watches yeah Sure , okay , right , okay . marketing:  just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , project manager: marketing: and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . marketing: Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . marketing: So we should think about project manager: So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea marketing: Yeah . project manager: I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . project manager: Chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: Okay  as for the case , kind of discussed that marketing: And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . marketing:  just a a lot of the   one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , project manager: marketing:  but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . marketing: Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly   theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? project manager: Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .  you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , marketing: Yeah clear , project manager: Aye that would be a good idea . project manager: S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . project manager: Is that what you mean ? industrial designer: You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . industrial designer: but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .  and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like  some kind of an innovative concept about how the  the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . marketing: Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? industrial designer: The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? marketing: Or industrial designer: Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . project manager: Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? marketing: Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? project manager: If you're holding it in your hand you could industrial designer: That's a very unnatural motion to project manager: Do you think ? industrial designer: yeah .  it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , marketing: project manager: okay okay industrial designer:  and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the marketing: Yeah , sure . project manager:  user interface: Well , but then for  for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to  to skip the channel button , the number part . industrial designer: and once they lose out on the user experience they're like Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of project manager: Okay . marketing: But that's not a bad thing is it ? project manager: Just marketing: Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . project manager: we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly .  I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . project manager: So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was  can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? marketing: Yeah like  if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , project manager: -huh . marketing: I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small project manager: -huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up marketing: I dunno . It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , project manager: Okay well if we can do that , great . marketing: well  isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? project manager: Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there  , and marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So you wanna expand the shape of the marketing: And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the industrial designer: That that might have one problem in terms of  in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . industrial designer: Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ? project manager: Okay . Right I'm gonna have to user interface: marketing: A jog di project manager: I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . It's kind of yeah project manager: Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing ,  I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? marketing:  industrial designer:  I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing  marketing: Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , industrial designer: Yeah that's what I was thinking the marketing: that'd be great . industrial designer: There's lots of space for it  project manager: That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . industrial designer: Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function user interface: marketing: Sure , yeah , project manager: Okay . marketing: yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . project manager: To make something flush with the case ? marketing: Something a bit more flush , yeah , project manager: Okay right . marketing: so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . user interface: marketing: They feel kind of like  , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , industrial designer: No like Yeah yeah . marketing: they're actually just plastic that's textured , industrial designer: Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . marketing: kind of a little bit like project manager: Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . So  that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that  pretty much run out of time to do so . marketing: industrial designer: Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . Okay lemme okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again "

        " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "Item 2 this morning is the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill: Stage 2 proceedings. I'm pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government; and Emma Gammon, lawyer for Welsh Government. As I said, the purpose of the meeting is to undertake Stage 2 proceedings on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. For these proceedings, Members should have copies of the marshalled list of amendments, the groupings of the amendments for debate and the voting order for the amendments. The marshalled list of amendments is the list of all amendments tabled, marshalled into the order in which the sections appear in the Bill. The order in which we consider amendments will be the default order\u2014that is, sections 1 to 3 and the long title. However, the order in which they're called and moved for decision is dictated by the marshalled list. Members will, therefore, need to follow the two papers, although I will advise Members when I call them whether they're being called to speak in the debate or to move their amendments for a decision. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair I will move amendments in the name of the Deputy Minister. For expediency, I will assume that the Deputy Minister wishes me to move all of her amendments, and I will do so at the appropriate place in the marshalled list. Deputy Minister, if you do not want a particular amendment to be moved, please indicate to me at the relevant point in proceedings. In line with our usual practice, legal advisers to the committee and the Deputy Minister are not expected to provide advice on the record. If Members wish to seek legal advice during proceedings, please do so by passing a note to the legal adviser and, if necessary, we can adjourn. So, we will proceed, then, to group 1, which is the duty to promote public awareness. I move amendment 1 in the Deputy Minister's name and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendment and the other amendments in this group. My amendments 1 and 4 will place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. I tabled these amendments in response to this committee's recommendation\u2014this was a recommendation from this committee in the Stage 1 report, so I have responded to that. I've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from Royal Assent, should the Bill be passed. I've considered amendments 1A to 1E, which have been tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders, and which relate to the duty to raise awareness. We don't think, actually, that this adds anything to the Government amendment, which already mentions awareness. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive, well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change, and understand how to respond to it. But I don't think it's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups, such as visitors to Wales, on the face of the Bill\u2014that's the approach taken in amendment 1E\u2014as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others. In relation to children, the committee will know that I'm fully committed to children\u2019s rights, and that Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions. An additional due regard requirement, such as the one set out in amendment 1D, relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed. This would be part and parcel of the Welsh Government approach to putting children\u2019s rights at the heart of our policy making. Similarly, I don't think it's necessary for the Bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, as is suggested in amendments 1B and 1C. Information required about parenting support will be considered by the parenting expert group, under the auspices of the Bill\u2019s strategic implementation group, working with my officials and the expert stakeholder group on the awareness-raising campaign. And, really, their thinking should not be constrained in any way by specifications on the face of the Bill. I think we always need to bear in mind that what the Bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence; it does not create a new offence. And in this context, it doesn't make sense for this Bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished. As I set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point, safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business, and, as now, the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, and I ask Members to reject amendments 1A to 1E because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the Bill. I wish to speak to amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness. While we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law, the Deputy Minister's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at Stage 1. An important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that I've tabled within this group\u2014that of a sustained awareness campaign, which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the Bill, but serves as a duty for future administrations. Amendment 1A: primarily, amendment 1A changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law. I don't think it's enough for the Welsh Government to say that the public should be made aware of the coming into force of section 1 and that a public awareness campaign needs to be sustained until the Welsh Government's objectives have been achieved. Despite the fact that it is intended to change behaviour, the consequences of this law are far greater than that of organ donation or prohibiting smoking indoors. Instead of an opt-out system or a civil offence, this law will remove a defence for parents, information on which could be there on their records for the rest of their lives, potentially separate parents, and could affect employment chances. As such, whilst we agree with the necessity of the awareness campaign, it is important too that the Welsh Government take stock and ensures that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. The witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands\u2014 lynne neagle am: Janet, Dawn is asking if you'll take an intervention. dawn bowden am: I just wanted to know\u2014could you give us examples of any other piece of legislation where there's been indefinite public awareness campaigns once it's been passed? janet finch-saunders am: There's a lot of legislation. The first Assembly term when I was here\u2014 dawn bowden am: Yes, what I'm asking\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: I'm trying to respond\u2014 dawn bowden am: What I'm asking for is: can you give us specific examples of where there have been indefinite public awareness campaigns running indefinitely past the enactment of a piece of legislation? janet finch-saunders am: The very first term that I was an Assembly Member, we passed 25 pieces of separate legislation. Even today, as I sit here, the public are not aware of many of those pieces of legislation. So, therefore, I think there is a necessity for both children and parents to become involved, and I shall speak now\u2014 dawn bowden am: With respect, Chair, that's not the question I asked. lynne neagle am: I can call you in the debate, if you'd like to make a more substantive contribution on this. janet finch-saunders am: The witnesses who we heard from before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands the implications. And that's what we're talking about here, Members\u2014the implications of removing this defence. Strikingly, the Office of Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent stated the following: 'the potential for public resistance to the Bill through misunderstanding or confusion over it implications may pose the largest barrier to its implementation.' If you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment, it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this Bill. Additionally, the committee found that while the current Welsh Government's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt, future Governments may have less of a commitment. This places further weight on the fact that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the Bill beyond its commencement. Furthermore, the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill quite clearly notes that, under section 2, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister can respond as to the reasons why the Welsh Government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment. [Interruption.] Should our amendment be agreed\u2014 lynne neagle am: Are you taking an intervention? janet finch-saunders am: No. janet finch-saunders am: Should our amendment to be agreed, we also request that a printing change be made to ensure that the new heading reflects promoting awareness of the changes to the law made by section 1. Amendment 1B: amendment 1B is in line with the committee's recommendation 9, which stated that, as part of a public awareness campaign, there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when disciplining their children. During evidence at Stage 1, the witnesses we saw before the committee raised serious concerns about harder-to-reach groups who needed to be made aware of removing the defence. For example, Children in Wales, Action for Children and Play Wales stated that some families and communities may be harder to reach with information and support. Now, while the Deputy Minister states that she would work hard to ensure that harder-to-reach groups receive this information, a duty to provide information on alternatives to physical punishment would ensure that future Welsh Governments would maintain a successful awareness-raising campaign. I note the Deputy Minister accepted the recommendation, through our amendment, but this does not explicitly include a duty to provide details about support for parents. As will be expanded upon later, the Deputy Minister has relied upon the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign to be delivered alongside awareness raising. However, this is only an online resource and she must be clear about what other avenues will be available to parents who do not have access to the internet or are part of harder-to-reach groups. Amendment 1C: amendment 1C supports the committee's recommendation 15 that explains that the Welsh Government should ensure clear advice is provided on what people can do if they have seen or learned of a child being physically assaulted. We urged, at Stage 1, that although many professionals were already under a duty to report concerns about physical punishment, regardless of the Bill, other witnesses raised concerns that it could create the potential for claims of abuse that are unfounded. In particular, some were worried that children, who may not realise the implications of reporting, could make allegations that are actually untrue. While we would expect the awareness-raising campaign to include the consequences of false accusations, this could also be reflected among adults, if the public are not sufficiently made aware of how they can report and in what situations they can report a case of assault. I think it's worth just pointing out at this stage that the majority of the amendments that are being made and articulated by Janet there are based on committee recommendations, and those recommendations were made after taking evidence from the public at large, but also you as well. So, that suggests that, at that stage, we weren't reassured by the offer that you were making because we felt the need to put these recommendations into our report. Now, I recognise that you've moved some way on some of these amendments, and we'll been talking about that through the course of the debates on other groups. But the one thing to bear in mind here is this is legislation, now\u2014that means that this is the instrument of the Assembly, not of Government, and if this Assembly feels that the face of the Bill is unclear on the minimum requirements of a public awareness campaign, then we have the right to suggest the things that we would like to see in that public awareness-raising campaign. The reason these have been tabled individually and independently is that some may be acceptable where others may not be, so it will be disappointing to hear that you're rejecting them all, and the reason they need to go on the face of the Bill is that, if you are going to introduce specifics via regulation, at the moment we have no reassurance about how you're going to do that\u2014about what input the Assembly, on behalf of our constituents, could have in designing that public awareness-raising campaign. Unless you accept some amendments in other groups, that is the position with this Bill: the influence of the Assembly will be zero over the content of an awareness-raising campaign. In terms of it being non-time limited, I think the amendment has been tabled in the way it has not to oblige you to an everlasting, never-ending campaign of awareness raising. But if you bear in mind that, seven years after the introduction of this Bill, there's going to be some reporting on the effectiveness of the Bill, what is the point of doing that if you don't then have an obligation, should the reports require it to be necessary, to continue promoting the changes in the law? I accept that that can't go on for centuries, but to actually limit it to two years on an issue that is so sensitive, and which has a reach beyond our boundaries, I think is genuinely a mistake. I think that's true, but I think Janet Finch-Saunders was right to say that members of the public, ordinary individuals, not professionals, will need assurance that they're doing the right thing. The amendment as listed is not even there to encourage people to do that, although that can be read in that way, but it is to help them be certain that they are doing the right thing. If this is going to be up to the individual, as you've said, and the committee itself wasn't reassured that individuals would know what to do, perhaps I can ask you to consider at Stage 3, if you're going to reject this amendment, how you can reassure members of the public that, if they are going to intervene on the back of this law, they're making things better, not worse. dawn bowden am: My comments, really, relate to ongoing awareness-raising campaigns, which I think all of us would want to see, and would appreciate in any changes in legislation. My point, really, is that we have a plethora of legislation that this Assembly has passed in the last 20 years, and I'm not aware of any legislation where, on the face of the Bill we have ongoing awareness-raising campaigns on an indefinite basis. It seems to me that, for some reason, you seem to be wanting to take a completely different approach to this piece of legislation. From what the Deputy Minister is saying\u2014and perhaps I will get some clarity on this\u2014there will be an amendment to the legislation that will say that we have an awareness campaign. That awareness campaign can be the subject of consultation with interested parties in terms of what needs to be included in it. It could also, I assume, Deputy Minister, be an awareness campaign that can be written into a set of guidance for future use. But the point I'm trying to make is that I don't believe that any piece of legislation requires ongoing and indefinite awareness-raising campaigns, and particularly in relation to visitors to Wales. Again, we have other pieces of legislation in Wales that are not applicable in the other parts of the UK. I am not aware that there is a necessity for awareness-raising campaigns with visitors coming into Wales on the raft of the other pieces of legislation that we have that they don't. And similarly, when we go to visit countries that have different legislation, we don't necessarily know what legislation we're going into when we visit that country\u2014you just go there and you accept that you go to a different country and you abide by their laws. So, my key point, Chair, is just the necessity of an ongoing, endless awareness campaign being written onto the face of the Bill. hefin david am: My comments follow logically from Dawn Bowden's comments, particularly in relation to amendments 1D and 1E. What you would be doing is that this Senedd, if this was on the face of the Bill, the duty on Ministers, would be putting the duty on Ministers in law beyond the life of the fifth Senedd, into the next Senedd term, and putting that duty on those newly elected Ministers after that, which, in principle, would be against the principles of binding\u2014 lynne neagle am: Hefin, are you taking an intervention from Suzy? hefin david am: Yes, happy to. hefin david am: I'm happy to take it now, because I was going to sum up by agreeing with the point you made, actually. You referred to this potentially binding Ministers in future Assemblies; at the moment, we've got an implementation period and a five-year reporting period that takes any reporting on this Act into the Assembly after next. I'm wondering if you're going to have any comments on that when we come to the amendment to change that later on. hefin david am: Well, when we get to that amendment, I'll make comments if I feel it necessary. But at this point in time, we're talking about amendments 1D and 1E, and particularly in relation to 1D and 1E it just isn't necessary, given the fact that\u2014I won't call it a concession, because I think you made a reasonable point about the Minister making a statement at Stage 3, and I think Dawn Bowden actually supported that as well. And that's my key point, really, which is why I wouldn't vote for those two amendments. I don't believe that there is a need for an indefinite campaign, as is outlined in 1A. I agree entirely that there is a need for a campaign during the period of change, and therefore I'm very glad to see that the Government has brought forward amendment 1, and I do hope that there will be a real push during the period of change. In terms of amendment 1B, I do have sympathy with what is being said here, but I believe that any kind of information or campaign in terms of enabling parents to learn about alternatives to physical punishment should be the subject of continual far-reaching work by the Government, through various programmes, and it should not be an addition on the face of this Bill, which deals with a small change to the common law. And then, on 1D also, if I may\u2014I don't agree with this either. Again, I believe that there is a need to promote awareness amongst children, but that should happen through the children's rights convention, as part of a broader programme to promote children's rights. julie morgan am: Thank you all very much for your contributions to the debate and your comments on these amendments today. I just want to re-emphasise that it is as a result of the recommendation from this committee that we are putting this duty to have the awareness campaign on the face of the Bill,\u00a0and I absolutely recognise the crucial role awareness raising has to play in supporting the implementation of the Bill. I'm very grateful for and appreciate the committee's interest and the work that you've done in this area of work. We're committed to a high-intensity awareness over six years from Royal Assent, and there is an expert stakeholder group supporting us with the development of the awareness campaign. Would you just take an intervention on that just to help me understand? A two-year awareness-raising campaign\u2014how have you concluded that\u2014 julie morgan am: Six-year. suzy davies am: Oh, so it is going to continue beyond section 1 coming into force\u2014 julie morgan am: Yes. Amendment 1B, about support available to parents and how to access it\u2014again, this level of detail is not required on the face of the Bill. I just want to emphasise we have got this expert implementation group, who are working on all aspects of this Bill, many of whom represent organisations who gave evidence to this committee. I think lots of these amendments are very helpful and interesting, but would be discussed and would be acted on in the normal pathway of planning and development, and they're not required on the face of the Bill. So, I'm not putting them down, I'm just saying that we don't need them to be there on the face of the Bill. And then amendment 1C\u2014the information about how to raise concerns\u2014I do repeat that safeguarding is everybody's business, and the same issues apply now as will after this defence has been removed. Amendment 1D\u2014Ministers to have regard to the need to promote awareness among children\u2014now, children's rights are absolutely enshrined in our policy making, and the entire Bill is about protecting the rights of children. Again, in terms of visitors, the level of detail is simply not required on the face of the Bill. And then to pick up a few of the other points that were raised, revisions to the impact assessments are being considered as part of my commitment to update the explanatory memorandum ahead of Stage 3. The issue that was raised about the Scottish Bill, that it refers to 'understanding'\u2014now, the Scottish Bill was not a Government Bill, it was a private Member's Bill, and our view is that nothing is added by adding the 'understanding'; 'awareness' is sufficient. So, basically, I think that the points made have been very useful, but I urge committee members to accept my amendments, but to reject those proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders, as they are unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needs to achieve. Does any\u00a0Member object? [Objection.]\u00a0Okay, I'll take a vote by show of hands.\u00a0All those in favour of amendment 1B.\u00a0All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, as there's an objection, I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 1? julie morgan am: I do. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, we have an objection, so we'll take a vote by show of hands. We'll move on now then to group 2, which relates to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation. I move amendment 2 in the Deputy Minister's name, and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments, and the other amendments in this group.",
        " The amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the Bill, and I believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee, so you strongly influenced this amendment. It's clear from Members' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at Stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment. I've already provided assurance that I agree with the importance placed on such a review, both in the explanatory memorandum and during Stage 1 scrutiny. I also made a commitment to bring forward a Government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the Bill. As I said in my responses to the Stage 1 committee report, and as set out in the explanatory memorandum, the post-implementation review of this Bill will not be a single piece of work, but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1. Firstly, we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys, which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment. Secondly, through a dedicated task and finish group, we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the Bill and to consider the possible impact on services. Turning to amendment 2C, this amendment would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced. This amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what I think is a priority for the implementation of this Bill: that is, given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders. I also think this amendment is not required because, as I've already stated, we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising. In June, I shared the findings of a representative survey, which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation. I speak to amendments 2C, excluding 2D, to 2K, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment. Again, I must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment. Amendments 2E to 2K outline what we would expect to be within this report, and we would wish to see a commitment from the Deputy Minister to ensure the National Assembly for Wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report. Amendment 2C requests that the Welsh Government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign and lays it before the Assembly before section 1 commences. As I have outlined under my amendments in group 1, the understanding of the public about the implications of the Bill cannot be sidelined. Although the Deputy Minister has repeated her commitment to a public awareness campaign, we, as the National Assembly for Wales, must be able to scrutinise its effectiveness before section 1 begins. As I noted under amendments 1B to 1E, there are specific groups of people who need to be evaluated on their understanding of the Bill's effect. I'm sure that the Deputy Minister will agree that the harder-to-reach groups are undoubtedly the most vulnerable to any negative impacts that the Bill will have because of the greater potential of a lack of awareness. It is, therefore, important for the Assembly to be able to determine whether the awareness-raising campaign has had a positive effect on these groups of people. As will also be elaborated under amendment 2D, it is extremely important that we, as the Parliament of Wales, are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign's impact. Before we implement what will be a criminal offence, it is vital that we ensure that those affected are not adversely impacted because of a poorly targeted awareness campaign. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister would commit to an independent evaluation of the awareness campaign's effects before section 1 commences. Deputy Minister, first of all, can I just say thank you for your opening remarks about the possibility of perhaps doing some work around amendment 2B? I'll come to that a little bit later, if I may. I just want to begin by commenting briefly on what you said about why you'll be rejecting amendment 2C here. I actually don't think that this amendment should affect or jeopardise the commencement date in any way at all. It's an operational requirement to get this work done before the commencement date that's in the draft Bill at the moment. So, failing to meet that would be as a result of operations not going well, rather than anything intrinsic in the Bill, so I'm not sure I can accept your argument on that. And, on 2D\u2014very pleased to hear that you'd be willing to introduce something about 'laying' rather than 'publishing' at Stage 3, but, in the spirit of recognising that this is the legislature, perhaps I could encourage you just to accept the amendment at this stage, because it doesn't make any difference. Your amendment is going to pass, and this amendment to it would be\u2014I think the gesture there would be very much appreciated. I'll be speaking mainly to amendments 2A and 2B, but I want to begin, again, by thanking you for moving some way on this and considering amendments to the Bill on the issue of reporting, because I know you were keen to avoid amendments in the name of simplicity; you mentioned it earlier. But this is not a newid bychan, I'm afraid, Si\u00e2n; the terms and the effect of this Bill are quite extensive, and it does need the reassurances, if you like, necessary to mitigate potentially disproportionate effects of this Bill on families where parents' actions had been lawful up until this point in statute. I know that you're sincere that you want this duty to report to show that the Bill is effective in stopping smacking as a punishment, and also that it is not as harmful to parents as perhaps some of us fear. But, if this were me bringing forward this Bill, I think I'd want to show the world that I was doing the right thing a lot sooner than you appear to wish to do. Amendment 2 means that the efficacy of the Bill will not formally be assessed until seven years after it has passed. If you're relying on the two-year period before section 1 comes into operation to do much of the heavy lifting on the culture change, and I think that is what you're expecting\u2014you know, showing a reduction in the incidence of physical punishment, reducing the number of, and indeed the likelihood of, parents putting themselves in the path of criminal liability once those two years are up\u2014I really would have thought you'd want people to know sooner, or as soon as the first possible opportunity on that. Waiting five years, I think, will diminish the ability of you to prove the efficacy of those initial two years, and this is why I'm grateful to you for your offer, because there may be a way where we can overcome that. If the trend of culture change is continuing after year 3\u2014so, basically, in the first year after section 1 comes into effect\u2014that's great, but there's a possibility it's going to reverse. For myself, I think one year would probably be enough, but I think three years is a reasonable compromise, as opposed to five years, for a reporting period. I can't see the reason for quite that length of time\u2014I know you've talked about New Zealand\u2014but neither can the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee. When they took the step of recommending this duty to evaluate and report, they also took the step of suggesting a three-year reporting period being more in keeping with other post-legislative scrutiny. That's something I think we perhaps need to bear in mind now, as we enter this period of the consolidation of law. Five/seven years is really something of an outlier, and while that might have been appropriate, perhaps, in New Zealand, I don't think that fits in with our timetables generally here in Wales, and, of course, there are other countries that have introduced this over a period of years, and I note that you haven't drawn on them in order to support your argument. So, can I urge Members and the Minister to consider the arguments behind these amendments? I don't think it's going to reassure anyone\u2014you may want to intervene at this point, Hefin\u2014that we not only won't hear in this Assembly, we won't hear in the next Assembly, about the formal evaluation of this, unless I follow\u2014 hefin david am: I won't intervene; I'll speak. suzy davies am: Is that okay? hefin david am: Yes, I'll make the point. lynne neagle am: Okay, I've got\u2014 suzy davies am: Yes, I'll take the intervention. lynne neagle am: No,\u00a0he doesn't want to make an intervention\u2014 hefin david am: I won't do an intervention; I'll speak. suzy davies am: Oh, apologies\u2014 hefin david am: Just to say\u2014 suzy davies am: I'll wait. The point I was making about 1D and 1E is they close down choices to Ministers in future Assemblies. An evaluative practice would actually open up those choices and give future Parliaments more options with regard to this Bill, so I think it's entirely consistent. I don't think the Minister, in putting in amendment 2, was trying to undermine my argument. Actually, I think she's being constructive by doing that, and I think amendment 2 is a practical amendment that's quite helpful, and its consequence will be to open up choices to future Parliaments, whereas my objection to 1D and 1E is they close those down. suzy davies am: Okay, well, as I say, I think, actually,\u00a0the Deputy Minister's offer of a three-year interim period might be part of a resolution to this. Because I'm not 100 per cent sure I accept your argument, either, because it closes it down for the interim period if we don't move on with the Deputy Minister's suggestion\u2014which I'll talk about now, actually. But I need some clarity on what you would allow this Assembly to do in helping define the terms of that interim report. Because you've been very clear that you don't want to accept the things that Janet Finch-Saunders has been talking about in a final report, and yet I can tell you we want to hear about these things. So, if you're in a position where you can give a commitment at Stage 3 not only to introduce an interim report, but that you will consult with, perhaps, this committee\u2014I'll leave it to you\u2014on the contents of that interim report, what we would want to see tested, then I'll be minded not to move amendment 2B. If you can't give me that reassurance, then I'm going to move it anyway and we'll return to it at Stage 3, if you don't mind. Just a final point on this issue of reporting within three months rather than as soon as practicable, and I do take your point that there may be a misalignment with reporting periods from the organisations you hope to talk to. Again, at Stage 3, I'm happy if you want to make three months six months, or something like that, but 'as soon as practicable' is open ended, and what you think is practicable may be very different from what I or my constituents think is practicable. So, I don't want to stick with what is practicable; I would like you to put a date on this. If it's a case that you think six months is long enough for data gathering and reporting from third parties, I think that's fairly reasonable as well, but I'm not minded to allow you to just keep this open ended. sian gwenllian am: Yes, I welcome adding to the Bill through amendment 2, and what you've said today also, that you're willing to provide an interim report and bring an amendment forward to allow that through the Bill, and to lay a report before the Assembly. I am interested in what Suzy is saying, and have a lot of sympathy with trying to tie it down to specific time periods, and not say 'when it will be practicable'. Therefore, I would encourage you not to move your amendments if you have the confirmation that you want to hear this morning from the Minister regarding these issues. julie morgan am: Well, just to start off on that point, I think your suggestion about how we consult and discuss, I think I'm very happy to accept that. So, I'm happy to discuss that with you, and with the committee, before the third Stage. Well, just to go on to cover some of the points that have been raised, on the issue of training now, I think Janet raised a number of points about training, and we do have an operations, procedures, processes and training task and finish group as part of our implementation work, and they are considering guidance and training requirements. There are many professional bodies represented on that group, many of whom I think have given evidence here today, and they've really got a chance to have their say. The officials are also looking at training as part of the revision of the explanatory memorandum at Stage 3, so there will be more information about training there. Generally, I think that all the contributions are very helpful, and I know they're meant in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation. I can't support amendments 2A, 2C, and amendments 2E to 2K, because these amendments make little difference in terms of practical effect to what we have in the Bill already, or they're covered by the Government amendments that I've moved. But I do hope the committee is reassured that we are committed to undertaking a very thorough, multifaceted review of the impact of the legislation that includes tracking public attitudes and considering impacts on\u00a0public services. Now, tracking the public attitudes will be going along at regular points, so there's no question there of having to wait; we'll be having regular reporting of public attitudes. Of course, I appreciate that you will not be supporting these amendments, but can you give us some indication of how many of the areas of interest to us you will be reporting on? So, even if this is not a statutory commitment, what exactly from our list, our wish list here, would you be prepared to include in your evaluation? julie morgan am: Well, I would actually have thought all of them. Obviously, this is not a statutory thing I'm saying, but\u2014 suzy davies am: No, no, and this is not a\u2014 julie morgan am: Yes, but considering those points you've put forward, I think all of them have got a great deal of relevance. We will certainly be reporting to the group to consider any of the ideas that you've suggested and, in particular with the data collection and the monitoring task and finish group, which is about developing methods to collect data, we will be putting forward some of the suggestions that you've made on those issues. I'm hopeful you may withdraw the two amendments\u2014I think one of yours and it was one of Janet's, wasn't it\u2014so that we could work together on those before the next stage. Because I am sympathetic to your views on these matters, and I think they do reflect some of the discussions in the committee as well. In line with the recommendations of the Finance Committee, further details of the costs associated with the post-implementation review will be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment at Stage 3. So, I think at this point I would ask that Members reject the non-Government amendments and agree to my amendments 2 and 5, which will ultimately achieve the same policy aim without the need for unnecessary detail on the Bill, with the exception, obviously, of those two amendments, which I'm prepared to look at a way of moving forward on. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote by show of hands. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 2A? suzy davies am: I move amendment 2A, yes. lynne neagle am: Janet, do you wish to move amendment 2E? janet finch-saunders am: I move. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so can I see all those in favour of amendment 2F? All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, can I see all those in favour of amendment 2G? All those against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so can I see all those in favour of amendment 2H? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Can I see all those in favour of 2J? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Does any Member object? [Objection.] I'll therefore take a vote by show of hands. All those in favour of amendment 2K? All those against? So, there voted two in favour, four against. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 2B? suzy davies am: In view of the Deputy Minister's reassurances, I won't move this amendment today, but obviously I reserve the right to bring something back if we can't reach consensus. lynne neagle am: Does any other Member wish to move amendment 2B? Okay, no. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 2? julie morgan am: I do. I move amendment 3 in the Deputy Minister's name and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments and the other amendments in this group. Members will note that I've brought forward an amendment to provide certainty on the date of commencement of the core provision in the Bill, which is obviously to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment. So, we're obviously debating that after we deal with these particular technical issues\u2014these are technical issues here, basically. As a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a Welsh Minister to make an Order for commencement, the power to make transitory, transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the Bill coming into force would also be removed. So, I'm not seeking here to add any new powers to the Bill; amendment 3 will simply add this existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent. In fact, removing the power for the Welsh Ministers to commence the provision in section 1 by Order means the statutory instrument will actually do less than originally intended. These amendments are technical in nature and while I acknowledge that the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied, their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied. The absence of an Assembly procedure does not mean that Ministers' decisions in relation to transitional powers cannot be scrutinised by the Assembly. This was a point made to CLAC and, as I say, their final conclusion was that no procedure is the appropriate procedure for such a power. Well perhaps, Deputy Minister, I can begin by saying that one person's technical issue is another person's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny. But I thank you for noting the Assembly's observations on the ministerial powers granted in this Bill\u2014this time by CLAC, as you say. Moving this\u2014and I'm glad actually that amendment 8, I think it was, has removed an Order provision and we're moving into an area where at least statutory instruments do feature here. I have to say that amendment 3A is something of a probing amendment, and I'll explain why now. Your amendment 3 seeks to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1, but it's actually in a substantive part of section 1 itself now\u2014it's not a separate commencement power. And, actually, I've been listening to the rest of this debate, and thinking that, if you're going to be introducing an awareness campaign and a report, the chances are you're going to need some regulatory powers to introduce some of the aspects of both those policy areas, I think. And I'm wondering whether the\u2014what is it\u2014transitory, transitional and saving provisions are actually enough powers for you under the course of this Bill. I'm wondering whether you want to consider actually amending this to give yourself the more usual unrestricted power to make regulations in order for you to get section 1 implemented, bearing in mind that it has now been amended from that original, very short and simple\u2014or at least simple in terms of drafting\u2014initial draft. As I say, in anticipation of you rejecting amendments in group 1 I tabled this, in order to make sure that an opportunity remains for the Assembly to bring anything you may wish to introduce under section 1, when it comes into effect, onto the floor of the Assembly. Because while I completely accept that you've acknowledged that statutory instrument is the process for introducing things from now on, it's still possible to do that without procedure, and so I have no idea whether you think what you introduce would be better suited to be introduced by a negative or affirmative procedure. Amendment 3A is a holding position, which we will return to you in Stage 3, because I think, again, this is an area where it might be valuable for us to discuss quite what kind of powers you're looking for, because I think you probably need something that's beyond transitional, transitory and saving. lynne neagle am: Are there any other Members who wish to speak on this group? No. We don't actually think it's necessary to have wider powers, but we will keep this under review and at Stage 3, I think that\u2014. When I was looking at this, I was concerned to know what the transitory powers\u2014what we would actually need to do at that stage, but I can understand that there may be links to other Bills in ways that we are not anticipating at the moment that would make it necessary to have those powers. So, basically, I don't think it is necessary to have wider powers, but I can assure you that we'll keep that in review coming up to Stage 3. suzy davies am: Can I just ask a question on the back of that? lynne neagle am: Will you take a brief intervention at the end, Minister? suzy davies am: Will you take the briefest intervention before your full stop? julie morgan am: I was going to end there, yes. suzy davies am: Right, okay, well, just before your full stop, would you just confirm that you're happy for us to discuss this before Stage 3? julie morgan am: Yes, very happy. Suzy, do you wish to move amendment 3A? suzy davies am: I'll move it, yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, I'll take a vote by show of hands. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 3? julie morgan am: I do. The committee will now break for 10 minutes and reconvene at 11.05 a.m. Can I welcome Members back? We will move on to group 4, which relates to the duty to ensure sufficient funding. As I outlined under amendments 2I and 2J, there are ongoing concerns about the potential costs for Welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment. Now, it was absolutely clear from evidence that we received in this committee that unknown costs would be challenging and potentially problematic. As I have mentioned previously, these concerns would doubtless be most keenly felt in our hard-pressed social services. Furthermore, the Welsh Local Government Association stated that there must be a commitment that whatever the costs are, those costs are met, because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales.",
        " Now, during evidence, the Deputy Minister, when asked about the reliance on a limited number of reporting of cases likely to happen and the potential for a degree of unknown costs stated: 'we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate.' But you couldn't commit to a broad figure, instead telling us that: 'we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us.' And: 'We have to measure it as we go along.' Given that devolved authorities need to plan their budgets for these changes, we only think it is fair for the Welsh Government to provide sufficient funding to alleviate the cost implications of this Bill. Now, while amendment 11 makes reference to costs borne by local authorities and health boards, I note that amendment 12 takes this further by including other devolved authorities that are not funded by Welsh Government. Anticipating the Deputy Minister's response that few under this category, if any at all, would be affected by the Bill, we are pursuing a principle here, and it is agreement to the principle of providing sufficient funding that we are seeking from you as the Deputy Minister. The Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013: last year, the Economy, Infrastructure and Skills Committee found that the Wales annual spend on walking and cycling is half that of England's and one sixth of Holland's. Furthermore, the committee highlighted that the passing of the Act put a requirement on local authorities to continuously improve active travel routes, but were constrained by the funding made available to them. Now, my local authority and other authorities that have done some monitoring on the active travel Act\u2014they simply were not awarded sufficient funding to actually allow the active travel Act to become a meaningful piece of legislation, and the same goes with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. This month, the auditor general has raised concerns that the public services boards created under the Act were limited in their work and impact due to the lack of dedicated funding. Outside of the Welsh Government's regional grant that cannot be spent on projects, councils often contribute through officer time or facilities, but resources and capacity to support those PSBs remain a key risk, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more. The reason that I wanted these amendments placed in here is I genuinely do not believe that you've even envisioned what, or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organisations, and certainly our local authorities and health boards, the impact this Bill is going to have. I can understand that the Member is concerned about the impact of this Bill on public services, but you will see from the explanatory memorandum and from the raft of impact statements published with the Bill that we've done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of this Bill before introduction. And as far as we're aware, no other country has done more than us to consider the impacts of similar legislation, and also comprehensively prepared for implementation. We've explored the published data, which is available from other countries, on the impact of measures they've taken to prohibit the physical punishment of children. We've also spoken to a range of stakeholders in Ireland, New Zealand and Malta, who have legal systems similar to our own. And stakeholders have been clear when giving evidence to this committee that they do not consider there will be runaway costs, and I think we should trust their judgment on this. In fact, as this committee notes in its Stage 1 report, those delivering services on the front line have said, without exception, that 'this Bill will improve their ability to protect children living in Wales because it will make the law clear.' Sally Jenkins of the Association of Directors of Social Services said to this committee: 'In terms of thresholds for children\u2019s services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. Jane Randall, chair of the National Independent Safeguarding Board Wales, said: 'there's no expectation that there's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals coming through to local authority social services, I think it would be dealt with within their existing resources.' And Dr Rowena Christmas, Royal College of General Practitioners, said: 'I can't see it's going to lengthen consultations. I can't see that it's going to increase the number of consultations, and I don't think it's going to increase the number of referrals I make to the health visitor or to social services, because if I was worried, I'd make those referrals now regardless of the Bill.' I just want to say again that the Bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault, which has formed part of the common law of England and Wales for a very long time. And social services already receive and investigate reports of children being assaulted, including from health and education, so it's not a whole new area of costly activity for any of them. As I've already pointed out when discussing group 2 amendments, we're working with organisations to put in place arrangements to collect data about the possible impact on their services, and this will be analysed as part of the post-implementation review of the legislation. Welsh Government can consider with relevant organisations how best to manage any impact on workloads or resources and any cost implications. I can assure you that work to update the regulatory impact assessment has continued, and I've asked officials to prepare a revised RIA, as recommended at Stage 2, and I expect to share an updated RIA with you in advance of Stage 3. Serious consideration is being given on how to provide more detailed estimates of the unknown costs to public services arising from the Bill, but I think you should be reassured by the evidence that was given, particularly to this committee, from the professionals at the front line. What the amendments are proposing is outside the normal funding arrangements that operate within Government, and it's not clear why, in the context of the evidence heard at Stage I, such provisions are necessary. I'm sure that Members will agree that future Governments need to be able to consider, within the context of the budget-setting process, what the priorities are, and these considerations would need to be made within the context at that time, for example taking into account any issues that there are\u2014UK Government actions, what happens in relation to Brexit, or any other unforeseen impacts on the economy or Welsh society. Furthermore, as is the case now, the National Assembly for Wales scrutinises the Welsh Government budget annually, so it would be able to make an argument for additional funding for public bodies, should it consider that this is required. I do think all the evidence has shown that we do not anticipate that there will be a huge increase of a demand for funding, so I urge Members to reject these amendments, which I believe are unnecessary. janet finch-saunders am: Chair, could I ask a question? lynne neagle am: You can reply to the debate now, Janet, yes. When we were taking evidence, at an earlier stage, I noticed that part of the stakeholder group\u2014there was some liaison going on with social services departments across Wales. What discussions have taken place with our local authorities in terms of their social services departments in terms of the lead, the cabinet members, or, indeed, the head of service? I can speak from my own experiences, when going around my constituency, but when I've spoken to some of the family support groups, and, indeed, the departments themselves, they are very concerned about the financial impact that this is going to have on the provision. They're already overstretched, and they see this as another burden\u2014primarily another financial burden. So, how much have you engaged with them? julie morgan am: There's been extensive engagement. We've had meetings with the Association of Directors of Social Services, and they're represented on all our groups, and we're working very closely with them, because, of course, they represent all the local authorities. But I have to say, when I've been going round and meeting lots of different groups, the first thing they say is, 'I'm so glad that you're doing this', and they haven't mentioned any financial implications. But, obviously, we will be very aware of\u2014we are looking at any more evidence that comes up. I was hoping to see some commitment to\u2014this Bill was going to go through, and it's one that could be implemented fully, because sufficient resources were there. Janet, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 12? janet finch-saunders am: I move. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 4? julie morgan am: Yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you want to proceed to a vote on amendment 5? julie morgan am: Yes. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you want to move to a vote on amendment 6? julie morgan am: Yes. lynne neagle am: I move amendment 6, then, in the name of the Deputy Minister. And I call Suzy Davies to move amendment 9 and to speak to the amendment and the other amendments in the group. Amendment 9 is actually consequential on amendment 10 passing, but it's the lead amendment in the group, so I'll move it to begin the debate. You've said repeatedly, and I believe you, that you do not wish to criminalise parents but just to stop them physically punishing their children. You could have chosen to try and achieve this through awareness raising and civil enforcement, but by choosing to remove the defence to a criminal act you have entered the arena of criminal law, where the logical consequence is opening parents up to liability\u2014not necessarily getting prosecuted, but liability to prosecution, not just liability to civil sanctions. I'm sure you'd prefer parents not to be prosecuted, but that decision does not and cannot lie with you. You, like us, have no agency in this, because the powers and the duties of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service sit outside our competence. You cannot and we cannot, by law or otherwise, instruct either of them in the delivery of your policy intention of not criminalising parents. You've acknowledged to this committee and the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee that revised CPS charging guidance and any other guidance on, for example, out-of-court disposals, are key to delivering your policy objectives. You'll remember how concerned this committee was when we learned that your advisory group\u2014the strategic implementation group, is it\u2014was only in the early stages of discussing what these guidelines might look like. So, you're actually asking us to pass law when we have no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children\u2014no control of the regard given to the relevance of force, the frequency of the offence, any prior conviction, any prior reporting, not even the views of the child in how they might be sentenced, or thresholds that would be appropriate for cautions and other out-of-court disposals; no guidance to the police on thresholds for arrest, let alone charging. And you argue that the rights of the child are what matter, and I agree with you here, but everybody, adult or child, has a right to natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, and you are in no position to offer us any comfort on these matters at this stage. I anticipate that that's unlikely, and I hope I'm wrong, but that's why Janet and I have tabled amendments 10 and 15, which prevent you bringing section 1 into force until that CPS guidance has been fully updated to take into account the change in the law and until pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed. That reflects our recommendation 4, this committee's recommendation, as well as CLAC's recommendation 1. It gives your strategic implementation board time to consider how it can get around the other fundamentally worrying issue of the effect of recording reports of apparent physical punishment, even if those reports ultimately prove unfounded. I have to say, Minister, I think these points are so serious that I would have liked to have tabled amendments preventing you seeking Royal Assent for this Bill until the Assembly has seen drafts of the range of official guidance needed for the police and CPS. I'd have sought a Report Stage, if I could, so that we could consider that evidence. But I'm therefore asking you to support the amendments we have tabled, 10 and 15, so that we can bring some damage limitation to a process that you ultimately cannot control once this Bill has passed. Now, I know you've got the numbers to pass this Bill, whether you accept amendments or not, but I just hope you can see the danger in pushing forward with a Bill that changes a person's relationship with the criminal law when you have no legal control over the consequences of that, and you're inviting this Assembly to fall into the same trap. Janet, do you want to speak? janet finch-saunders am: Yes, I wish to speak to amendments 14 and 16. As was clear during the committee's evidence sessions, present Welsh Government support programmes for parents have insufficient coverage. For example, the capacity and reach of the Healthy Child Wales programme came under question on its role in awareness raising, with health representatives acknowledging that universality had not been achieved, with 53.2 per cent of children in Wales reported as being contacted. Furthermore, existing parenting support is often only available as part of a targeted programme in specific areas, such as Flying Start, and even the children's commissioner noted that much more is needed to support parents to find alternatives to disciplining their children. Now, the Deputy Minister mentioned the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign as part of proposals on a wider package of support for children and their parents. However, the Deputy Minister was challenged on this fact, that this is an online campaign only, and could only respond that the mapping exercise she will undertake. Therefore, the Deputy Minister needs to assure the committee and the public that universal support will be provided before the removal of the defence occurs. I've listened to what stakeholders and committees have said about the importance of ensuring sufficient time is available prior to the change in the law to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment during Stage 1. As a result, I have brought forward amendments in this group to provide certainty around the date for the change in the law. My amendment 7 will remove the power to commence this core provision of the Bill by Order of the Welsh Ministers and ensure that the defence of reasonable punishment is abolished at the end of a two-year period beginning the day after Royal Assent. Up to then, we'd always said 'up to two years'\u2014well, we're giving two years. This certainty will allow key partners, including the police, social services and the Crown Prosecution Service, to plan for changes to guidance, training and data-collection systems more effectively. My amendment 8 in this group has the consequence of removing the power to make transitional provision, which is replaced by my amendments 3 and 6, and we discussed those in the previous group. I've listened to the arguments put forward by Suzy Davies and Janet Finch-Saunders for the amendments in this group that they have tabled. These amendments are all about making the commencement of the Bill conditional on something else happening, whether it's waiting for the revision of Crown Prosecution Service guidance, or the establishment of a pathway for diversion from the criminal justice system, or for the provision of parenting support services. As I set out in my letter of response to the Stage 1 report from the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee, we've got good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group, and we work very closely with them. But the CPS are an independent body, as Suzy Davies has said in her contribution, not answerable to Welsh Ministers or this legislature, and it's not appropriate for a Minister or the National Assembly to seek to influence the CPS guidelines. And, in fact, I think that these amendments\u2014Suzy's amendments in particular\u2014wouldn't just seek to influence the CPS, but would actually give power to a non-devolved body on the way that we legislate in Wales. I think you have to rely on the fact that we have got this very good relationship, very close working relationship. And I think legislating to effectively give a non-devolved body a power to commence, or not, Assembly legislation would be highly unusual and would raise great uncertainty, I think, if we did go down that track, because I think this is very important Welsh legislation, which does have broad support across the Assembly. And I don't think we should allow non-devolved bodies to be the final arbiters of commencement of our legislation. I think the CPS is entirely independent of Government, and must be entirely independent of Government, and will make its own decisions about how and when it will revise its guidance. In addition, you suggest we allow the UK Government to have a say in when Welsh legislation is commenced in an area that was specifically devolved to the Assembly. If these amendments passed, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to judge when section 1 could be commenced. This contravenes what stakeholders and committees have asked for, and raises huge uncertainty, which potentially jeopardises the Bill. And I want to assure you again, not only do we have good working relations with the CPS, but also very good working relationships with the police, who are, of course, the other non-devolved body who have great involvement and interest in these issues. My amendment to provide a two-year period between Royal Assent and commencement means these groups can plan their work to a known timescale and deliver in good time before the law comes into force. And then, when it comes to parenting support, the committee knows that I've committed to reviewing the existing provision of parenting support, and work is already under way through the parenting expert group on this very issue. I have already said I will expand the age range of the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign, and I think\u2014. For example, the universal service of the health visitors is absolutely crucial, and that is a service that is for every child. And the expert group is considering what it'll recommend for the future, and it needs the time to be able to do that, to support the Bill as well as to support parenting more widely. So, as I said, I think these are important points that you have raised, but I don't think they are appropriate. So, I therefore urge the committee not to support amendments 9 and 10, nor 13, 14 and 15. suzy davies am: Thank you very much, and thank you very much, Deputy Minister, as well. I'm disappointed that you haven't seen what's behind Janet Finch-Saunders's final amendment there, actually. Maybe it's something we'll raise again with you at Stage 3, or maybe in the conversations that we have between now and then. But I want to go back to amendments 10 and 15 that I've raised and your assertion that we're giving, or attempting to give, power to the CPS here. And this is why I go back to where my contribution to this started, and it's your choice to try and resolve the problem of\u2014or, sorry, to try and protect children's rights through the medium of a change to the criminal law rather than the many opportunities that were available to you through the civil law and over which you would have had complete competence. This Bill\u2014and, actually, you've said a couple of times in your response today that it's important that it's commenced on a certain date. My argument is: it shouldn't be commenced at all unless you are absolutely certain about how it is likely to affect the parents who will now be captured by the removal of the defence. And, while I claim no mischief on the part of the CPS or the police\u2014obviously I don't\u2014there is nothing you can do that would prevent the CPS, should they wish to do it, or indeed the police with their own guidelines, putting in place something that is wholly disproportionate to the offence that is now being released by the removal of a defence. And, because of that, I ask you to consider, or balance, actually, two important things here: one is the rights of the child, obviously at the forefront of your argument on this, which I would argue could be completely and safely protected through the use of civil law on this occasion; and, actually, the rights of the child again to have a good relationship with parents over whose future they will have no say\u2014or at least you cannot allow them to have any say in how those parents might be treated in terms of sentencing. The relationship between parents and children obviously is different in every family, but that's something you ought to protect in what you're trying to do here, and by leaving it open, as you say, to completely different\u2014sorry, undevolved, two undevolved authorities to make decisions about how that relationship could be affected deeply worries me. I know this isn't going to stop your Bill going forward, but I really want you to consider my arguments and how you might try and address them at Stage 3, because leaving, effectively, the delivery of your policy objectives to somebody over whom you have no control, despite your great relationship with them, should worry us all as a legislature. Do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 9? suzy davies am: Oh, because of the voting order\u2014. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to move to a vote on amendment 7? julie morgan am: I do. lynne neagle am: I move amendment 7 in the name of the Deputy Minister.\u00a0The question is that amendment 7 be agreed. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Does any Member object? [Objection.] We have an objection, so I'll take a vote. Deputy Minister, do you wish to proceed to a vote on amendment 8? julie morgan am: I do. Well, that has brought us to the end of our amendments, so can I thank the Deputy Minister and her officials for their attendance? As usual, you will be sent a transcript of the meeting to check for factual accuracy. Standing Orders make provision for the Deputy Minister to prepare a revised explanatory memorandum, taking account of the amendments agreed today. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, following our meeting on 2 October. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services updating the committee on the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' strategy. And paper to note 3 is a letter from myself to the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services regarding early childhood education and care, following the session that we held on 2 October. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting"

        "We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns, who is substituting for Suzy this morning. Can I also welcome Si\u00e2n Gwenllian to the meeting? Si\u00e2n is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference. I'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University, although I haven't done any work for them for some time. We'll move on, then, to item 2 this morning, which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations. I'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney, who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you? dr david blaney: Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between\u2014. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well. angela burns am: Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves\u00a0looking like at present? dr david blaney: Here, I refer to my learned friend. There's a difference between the distributable reserves\u2014I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have. angela burns am: I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students\u2014it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before. bethan owen: We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have. bethan owen: And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that. angela burns am: So, overall, you're painting a picture of a sector that's under a significant degree of financial stress, and this is obviously using your key financial indicators. Do you monitor each and every university, or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is? bethan owen: We monitor, we receive forecasts, five-year forecasts, and we meet frequently with all our universities now. It varies, depending on the risks of the universities, as to how frequently we meet, but we're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July, the changes, even in the 12-month period, are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is. Although it had a turnover and income of \u00a31.5 billion, which had increased, nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, but notably, again, the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme\u00a0and the universities' superannuation scheme as well, and those will be significant costs\u00a0that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge. angela burns am: Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years? dr david blaney: I don't think so. As I said earlier on, we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost, but that's not the same as falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector, and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, we're in a managed situation, but the challenges are quite acute. angela burns am: When you talk about structural change, are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close? I bring this up because I'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and I have had multiple representations from students, and their parents, who are about to go to Lampeter and who've been told that courses are being restructured, there's a massive staff loss, and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained. So I am trying to drill down a little bit, because I think it's only fair for the students to know what they're up against, and also it's a bit like in the great depression\u2014you can start a run on something, can't you? Because if enough people believe it, then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university, really top-quality in medieval literature, in archaeology. And I'm just talking about one, but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales, so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes. So, if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week, from my reading of the transcript, it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making. There was reference to the national student survey scores, and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student, because you are looked after properly in Wales. But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there's a crisis, and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media, the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it didn't. At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students, it's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation. So we do need to make sure, I think, all of us, that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it, and that is very harsh. I'm not being critical of the political process here, but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we don't start a run on this. In terms of the specifics at Lampeter, we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments, and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students. So there's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments, and that's a contractual obligation anyway, so it's a legal obligation. But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study. So they're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they're not planning to continue\u2014they just are not going to do that. And if you think about it in a market context, it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that. angela burns am: But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David's financial plans. dr david blaney: Yes, I understand that, so let\u2019s come back to the material uncertainty. What I'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students. They will look after their students and if they're recruiting to programmes, they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run, and run through to completion. And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that\u2014when they are engaged in portfolio change, they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have. In terms of our oversight and monitoring, our primary consideration, again, is the interest of the students. They are the people who have, in many ways, least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed. Although, they do have a voice and, actually, the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are, again, better than elsewhere in the UK. But, nonetheless, we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing. Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis. So, we have machinery, which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year, to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they're facing. So, it's not the challenges you face, it's the way you face your challenges\u2014it's a clich\u00e9\u2014and, at the moment, they are managing them, but if we were in any way concerned that they weren't, the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited, and we do intervene when we have to. angela burns am: Well, following on from what you said, I've just got two really specific technical questions, then, to ask, because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on. So, considering how much is invested in their estates, are you happy that each university's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place? dr david blaney: Yes, so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution, so there is proper governance oversight. And in all of those instances, there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates. So, the machinery is in place\u2014 angela burns am: Because it's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing, isn't it? dr david blaney: Indeed, it is. angela burns am: So, if our universities are on a sticky wicket, we just need to know that the borrowing that they're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate. So, as long as you're content, if I can hear you say that\u2014[Laughter.] dr david blaney: Okay. We're content on two fronts: one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that, but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing, they have to get our consent as well. And what we don't do is second-guess everything, but what we do do is make sure that the governing body, or its relevant committees, have been asking the right questions. bethan owen: Can I just add to that, then? angela burns am: Yes, of course. bethan owen: In asking for the forecasts, we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios. So, to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past, where there's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast, we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided\u2014not just the governing body\u2014with the scenario where there is no growth in the income. That's not the core forecast, but a scenario, so that it's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth, and if that growth doesn't come through, what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met. And we should probably just differentiate between\u2014we have a role before borrowings are entered into, but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict, certainly what's happened in the last two years, probably, in universities. So, there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings, because that's essential for maintaining their liquidity. angela burns am: Which actually, neatly, thank you, brings me to my last question, which is: have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them, unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due? bethan owen: There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015, financial reporting standard 102, so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants, but it was because the accounts were looking very different. The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements, largely student accommodation arrangements, and pension costs, significantly, were recognised in the accounts. So, most universities have had to renegotiate covenants, but we're not aware of any who've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches, other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements\u2014that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements, which they have done earlier this year, and they have now negotiated new covenants. It's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us. Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control. So, again, from that perspective, we have the covenants built into our forecasts, we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants. The nature of those covenants vary, but most of them require a measure of cash flow, a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt, so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system, as well as our ongoing monitoring as well. Just before we move on to Hefin David, can I just ask you what your view, then, is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty? bethan owen: Yes, I'll pick up on that. The material uncertainty largely relates\u2014there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account, but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution. The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project, which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal. That funding has been delayed, but the sums due to the university are still due to the university\u2014it's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure. Just in terms of cash flows, all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due. Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis, staff costs in particular, but the income flows into universities are now less regular. In days gone by, that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis. A quarter of that money comes in in October, a quarter in February, and the majority of it, half of it, doesn't come into the university in cash until May. So, that's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage; it requires holding cash balances to do it. Just before I bring Hefin in, we're going to need to have a bit of agility, as Dai Lloyd would call it, in our questioning and our answers if we're going to cover the ground that we need to cover. hefin david am: How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent? dr david blaney: So, the first point to make, of course, is that universities are autonomous, as you know\u2014 hefin david am: I've just written 'independent and autonomous'. The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery, particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities. The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs, the CUC guide, which identifies good practice. Just in terms of governing bodies, it's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing, because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives, which is important. But it\u2019s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts. But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we\u2019ve been discussing already this morning, the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant. So, we have encouraged the sector, both the chairmen of the university councils, but also the vice-chancellors, to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales. And it hasn\u2019t been hard for us to encourage that\u2014they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock. The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system\u2014they don\u2019t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations, but there is scope in Wales, given the scale of the sector, to actually construct something that is more challenging, I think, in terms of expectations, than might be the common denominator across the UK, and maybe some more exemplification. It\u2019s going to be quite hard to do this, but I\u2019m very keen that we engage\u2014and the sector are up for this\u2014in governance culture, because, actually, you can do process checks and you\u2019ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going, but, in the end, it\u2019s the dynamic within that room and who\u2019s asking which questions and how well informed they are, and whether it's an open culture or is it a defensive culture\u2014these are really what influences the quality of decision making. hefin david am: And how different are those cultures across institutions? dr david blaney: I think it\u2019s very hard to say. Typically, that\u2019s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to\u2014 hefin david am: Do you have the option to observe at any point? dr david blaney: We can't insist, I don't think. But in the main, actually, our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway, so I'm not sure that's necessarily helpful. But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge. Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches, then? dr david blaney: I think we\u2019d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations. In the end, it\u2019s about personalities, it\u2019s about people\u2019s background and it\u2019s about their knowledge. And we have a role to play in this as well, so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors, which, essentially, is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK, across a number of factors. So, if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive, they can see that in the data. Whether that toolkit needs a refresh\u2014I\u2019m sure it probably does, it\u2019s been there for a while now\u2014. So, part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well. This is quite distant from Government\u2014unlike other institutions, where you can prescribe some of these approaches. dr david blaney: Yes, and in the end I don't think there's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice. hefin david am: So, what about risk appetite? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite? dr david blaney: I don't think so, and this manifests itself in two ways. So, we would see this coming through in forecasts, and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings, predominantly. Our links into institutions are many and various, and we have our formal stuff, but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we\u2014. One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they can't hope to in England. But we have, in some instances, I think it's fair to say, helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations. So, where we've seen things and we think, 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic,' we've just asked the questions. We don't say, 'No, you can't do that,' because they are autonomous, they make the decisions, but we try to make sure that they're asking the right questions. hefin david am: So, would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves, in that, where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence, are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge? Or the fact you've just said that, does that suggest to us that, actually, they are falling short? dr david blaney: I think there's a mixture of things going on. We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing. So, you have a governing body with a range of perspectives, and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution, and just occasionally it's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things.",
        " So, I don't think it's a shortfall as such, but I just think\u2014 hefin david am: The kind of honest broker role, kind of. dr david blaney: The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role, and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that. So, we have relationships with the banks; they come and see us every now and again\u2014typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it. Interestingly, for example, when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities, we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days, wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be. So, it's not really a governance failure; it's just that the machinery includes us. And one of the things, from a distance\u2014, I've been involved in different ways in an institution, and looking at the institutions from a distance. Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective, and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well? Those executive permanent staff and the governors\u2014is there challenge there? dr david blaney: I would say, in the main, yes. Occasionally, we help the governors to ask the right questions, so occasionally that external perspective we've just discussed is helpful in that regard. Actually, there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies, inevitably\u2014that's not something that's remarkable\u2014and we can feel that as well. hefin david am: And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well\u2014you know, media reports and\u2014. dr david blaney: Yes, sometimes these things can spill, and the governing bodies also include student representation, staff representation, who are typically union reps, and so, you know, there are all sorts of\u2014. I'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet, but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context. And these tensions are not all-out war, but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through, and that's governance working properly, I think. hefin david am: Okay, which is\u2014some of the work you've suggested will help towards that. hefin david am: And a last question: you've identified one university as high risk, five as medium, and two as low in the short to medium term. You're obviously not going to tell us which, but what I'm interested in is the direction of travel, and whether those that are 'medium'\u2014are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high' in the near future? dr david blaney: I think it's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales, and it's about the financial pressures that we've already discussed this morning. And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement, and, indeed, other bits of money now and again, are so important. So, she's doing what she can, and that's really good, but we always knew that, between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation, there was going to be a valley to cross. So, the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure; there's a demographic dip, and there are the other contextual factors we've discussed. And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really don't have to take out, because they don't want to reduce capacity, which they'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves. So, they are seeing deficits, which are managed deficits, where they're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in. hefin david am: And, if you're back in a year or two's time, the next few years, are we confident that there won't be more in the high-risk category? You said you don't see collapse, but are we confident there won't be more in the high-risk category? dr david blaney: Well, I think what I would always say about this process is that it doesn't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy. HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation, so I'm not going to say we're confident, but that doesn't mean to say we're worried either. So, to answer my question: are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not? dr david blaney: We might. bethan owen: And, just to add, I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students, because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales, but from England and internationally\u2014so, that's a key part\u2014and also that our research portfolio is invested in, and that also brings economic benefits. So, I think those are the two that we are [correction: need to be] able to maintain: the institutions as attractive options for students, and that our research capacity is invested in. sian gwenllian am: Just in the interest of transparency, are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk? dr david blaney: We don't publish that; we publish numbers. hefin david am: They didn't even try to\u2014[Inaudible.] [Laughter.] lynne neagle am: Okay. Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been? bethan owen: We publish our funding allocations, and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June. For 2019-20, we're allocating \u00a3149 million, and, as David said, this is the first year that we've been able to start putting funding, additional funding, in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector. So, that means we've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by \u00a37 million\u2014not a significant amount, but it's a start. And we have maintained QR, which is our funding for research, quality research, and postgraduate research, at least at the same levels of \u00a376 million, as it's been that in previous years. We've increased part-time funding by \u00a31 million to \u00a326 million, and we've started to increase support for expensive subjects\u2014that's medicine, dentistry and conservatoire provision\u2014and higher cost subjects\u2014those are the sciences and the STEM. So, we made a start on that and increased that support by about \u00a36 million to \u00a320 million in total. And, in addition to that, we have strategic funding that we're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the S\u00ear Cymru project. And then, in addition to our recurrent funding, we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years. So, we're developing programmes for civic mission, community engagement, collaborations between higher education and further education, and, more recently, we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid's report for research investment, and also for developing mental health and well-being. That strategic funding is very welcome, but to be able to build those activities into our core funding, which we hope Diamond will bring, would be more sustainable for institutions. How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE? dr david blaney: So, there are probably two dimensions to this. First of all, we have provided \u00a33.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE. So, we put out a circular inviting proposals for that, and it was competitive, so we funded what was the best of the proposals, and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity, but not just to keep things ticking over. We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities, which we probably haven't got time to go into now. I've got a long list here, but, for example, in south-east Wales, the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University, Cardiff Met, with the Open University and all the FE players in the region. We tried to get it within regions, because that's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work. And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons, and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE. There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales, and our funding method has, historically for some time now, protected that money. So, we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus, because we think it's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities. And, certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be, for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive, so\u2014. Then, finally from me, the council's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income. So, what are the issues here, and how will you take this forward? bethan owen: The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided, probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions. A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities. There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money. And we're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions. More transparent reporting of income and expenditure, and not just fee income, is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities. Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision, but there's much more to the student experience than that, so there are costs: there are the infrastructure costs, the student support costs, even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision. So, more transparency of all the universities' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you can't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research, you have to look at the whole\u2014so, we'll be working with them to improve that information. We're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding. hefin david am: Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales, as I understand it, and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK. How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements? bethan owen: We've allocated \u00a326.5 million in 2019-20\u00a0to support part-time provision, and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth. So, there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so. That came at an overall additional cost of \u00a31.9 million, and, based on what we're hearing from student support, we're expecting to see that requirement increase. So, it's one of the areas where we'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding. And at the moment, our intention\u2014but subject to knowing the quantum of it\u2014is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision. hefin david am: So, is it possible\u2014? With the Welsh Government's policy of developing lifelong learning, is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly? dr david blaney: That is the challenge, and there's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are. There's a temptation, I think, at times, to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy, and it is important for reskilling and upskilling, but actually, it's important for other things as well. If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy, we've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes. But part-time is really quite difficult, because there's part-time that is about upskilling, part time that's about reskilling, there's part-time for social purposes, there's employer-supported part-time, there's student\u2014. dr david blaney: Well, there is a sense that they are more price sensitive, yes, and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important, and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year. But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time, what the market will deliver, what the market won't deliver, what we should fund and so on. And there's a complexity around all that, as I've indicated, which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector, with the student body as well, just to take some stock of this over the next year or so. hefin david am: Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students? dr david blaney: My sense is we won't. The Government wishes us to monitor, so we monitor, and that in itself is not straightforward, actually. There's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market. I don't think we'll see massive fee increases; we might see a bit, but we won't see masses, I don't think. We've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation, and also we'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds. If I could turn specifically to research, we know, of course, that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms, but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years. Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and, indeed, on the Welsh economy? dr david blaney: I'm sorry; I missed the beginning of that because I couldn't hear this headset. I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms. The reason the sum hasn't increased is because we haven't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system. Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding, for a number of reasons. The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base, which is sustained by QR funding. If they go for UK-based competitive research funding, that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix. So, they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research, with the expectation that QR will plug the gap. And we know that, although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive, and really is punching above its weight in many ways\u2014and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework\u2014we know that, actually, it could do so much more, if it just had more scale. So, we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important, and it's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time. It's almost impossible for a body like us, far less the Government, to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from, and QR provides the flexibility for institutions, which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic. sian gwenllian am: Therefore, you do have concerns that this isn't increasing\u2014you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment. But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding? dr david blaney: So, there is\u2014. Graeme Reid's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources, and there's a very close correlation\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research, to all intents and purposes? dr david blaney: Not directly. sian gwenllian am: Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research, which is educational research. How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically? dr david blaney: Bethan, did you want to say something on this? bethan owen: I was just going to add that, when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales, compared with the rest of the UK, it's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England, so the figures show that we receive less of the money that's available, which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage, so we're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that's available as well. sian gwenllian am: So, there's a knock-on to that; that's what you're trying to say. But from the point of view of my question on educational research\u2014? dr david blaney: So, we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues, and we're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales. I won't go into the full detail of it now, but it's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff, Cardiff Met, Trinity Saint David, Aber, Bangor and the University of South Wales. So, it's a collaborative effort, and we have, in the past, also funded WISERD Education, so it's an important research facility and increasingly being used, I'm delighted to say, by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking. sian gwenllian am: And likewise, in 2019-20, there will be allocations specifically for this. Well, could you provide the remit letter from\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014do that? You have to do everything in the remit letters. dr david blaney: We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters, as the wording goes. sian gwenllian am: And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union. Of course, this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research, and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact. So, what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding? dr david blaney: So, again, the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us. There has been an additional \u00a36.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government, which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid. So, that's a start, but that's not sustainable funding, and it's not enough, really, but it is a good and welcome start. Reid was also not just talking about the money, but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments. And in response to that, we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation, which was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations\u2014we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process? bethan owen: One aspect that we do intend to fund\u2014and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid\u2014is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide \u00a315 million back into the sector in innovation funding. sian gwenllian am: Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some \u00a37 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too. bethan owen: That \u00a315 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI\u2014and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research\u2014that we need more funding to do the same thing there. dr david blaney: And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those. lynne neagle am: Okay, Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups? dr david blaney: First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now\u2014we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over \u00a328 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer \u00a31,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales? dr david blaney: My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July"

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "project manager: and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first  marketing: No y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager: What ? marketing: No ? project manager: I I think I will let  our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . The second concept is a fancy controller ,  so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,  they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g  industrial designer:  . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Yeah , it's very , you know project manager: It's very big , user interface: if you're project manager: yeah . marketing: user interface: It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . user interface: so maybe we should  use   technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and  gesture recognition . project manager: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , user interface: Yeah . project manager: but as the  expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? user interface: Yeah , so project manager: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? user interface: Y marketing: industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? user interface:  I think some time it's very  convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . user interface: For example , if you cannot find your  controller , you can just  just just  speak something such as , yeah , one two . project manager: I industrial designer: Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager: Broken arm ? user interface: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing: Okay . project manager: Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface: Yeah . project manager: If you have one brother and one sister marketing: Yeah project manager: and they want to watch their favourite  T_V_ programme , marketing: Yeah , but the project manager: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , industrial designer: Yeah but Yeah user interface: Yeah , it's very interesting . industrial designer: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , marketing: I don't think it project manager: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , industrial designer: It's it's marketing: No . user interface: so it's c come to channel three , marketing: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . user interface: I don't have to project manager: Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . industrial designer: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager: Yeah , but one other question . marketing:  if you if if you use the basic user interface: No no we just  have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager: So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? Or ? user interface: Yeah , I think it's  because  this technology is   for limited wor or limited wor  lexical recognition , it's very project manager: Yeah , but   user interface: it's  yeah . It's marketing: But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . industrial designer: Well y y you have also the language problem , user interface: No it's  Even for the f  because the the vocabulary the industrial designer: you know when you project manager: project manager: Yeah , but there is one problem that  Baba talked about is the international industrial designer: Yeah . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , the key , the key  the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some  adaptation marketing: Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or industrial designer: Yeah but you know . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . industrial designer: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe project manager: okay . user interface: Yeah , project manager: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? user interface: it's industrial designer: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . project manager: Yeah , but how will you user interface: So industrial designer: Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . industrial designer: because  the for example for Se user interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to industrial designer: Oh really ? That's project manager: Oh . marketing: but then w Yeah , industrial designer: Comple user interface: No , it's not so complex . marketing: we have to take care of the twelve Euros project manager: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? marketing: problem . project manager: And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? user interface: No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . industrial designer: project manager: Yeah , but we're marketing: No , but then it's it's like this  project manager: here it's  an object . project manager: Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . user interface: Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer: I if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface: you use your command project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: yeah . user interface: No no it's n y if you lose it industrial designer: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . project manager: Okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer: Devic project manager: and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface: think it we should give the  flexibility to the user and we think marketing: Okay , so you project manager: Yeah , user interface: yeah . user interface: No , project manager: And maybe it will be quite user interface: that's quite inter quite attractive . industrial designer: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y user interface: Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . marketing: What ? project manager: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? marketing: If if  ,  I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . industrial designer: Yeah , but marketing: But if if if it like doubles  industrial designer: I think he need a control that is very reliable , marketing: no one would would be interested . project manager: So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . user interface: project manager: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . You think it's possible ? user interface: Yeah but if if you stick to  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? industrial designer: Yeah . No , user interface: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that marketing:  industrial designer: It's not really the we marketing: Y industrial designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But  I think a user need user interface: Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , marketing: No , user interface: but marketing: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , industrial designer: Don't have a the the Yeah user interface: Okay . user interface: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . industrial designer: Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing: Cause for example yeah . user interface: Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , marketing: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , but  we want so user interface: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . user interface: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . project manager: Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer: And for all the person of the family maybe , user interface: Yeah ,  project manager: You don't need to tune it . user interface: Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager: Yeah , why not ? If it's marketing: for example the goo y industrial designer: Because you have new marketing: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . marketing: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . marketing: so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . marketing:  thi this  , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface: The then nn marketing: or user interface: no . marketing: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . user interface: But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . marketing: See user interface: That's the same marketing: That's the problem , user interface: yeah .  , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . marketing: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product user interface: Yeah . project manager: Two ? industrial designer: Yeah , participant two  project manager: Working ? industrial designer: Yeah , working design , user interface: industrial designer: so . marketing: industrial designer: So I think project manager: I can industrial designer: Can you go to the next one ? I  it's not this one . industrial designer: It's  oth the oth so I marketing: industrial designer: It's the working design . project manager: It's okay industrial designer: So this yeah so this is the described use project manager: industrial designer: What ? Are you inst project manager:  I think there's something wrong with your user interface: It did didn't r receive it . project manager: It seems that we have a problem with the marketing: I dunno if you remember what you had to say or industrial designer: I can say it to you without . project manager: Yeah , so user interface: Yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager: No , I think it will be more interesting to start with  user interface:  to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , marketing: I think it's more interesting what he says , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: exac marketing: project manager: You will had s some more information in industrial designer: Okay . industrial designer: I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with user interface: project manager: Okay , never mind . industrial designer: so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r user interface: Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface: Okay . So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , project manager: industrial designer: so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . industrial designer: so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , project manager: industrial designer: And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example  d  solar energy alimentation user interface: -huh . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have  both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities  for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface: industrial designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager: Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers industrial designer: Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . project manager: and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer: project manager: no ? industrial designer: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , project manager: So . project manager: And what tha what about the  materials ? industrial designer: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager: Impersonal , industrial designer: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Special for industrial designer: or you know , you can have some project manager: Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer: Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood user interface: industrial designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager: Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . project manager: And you think that we will be industrial designer: Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , project manager: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: And what about the buttons ? industrial designer: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know  yeah , in the dark , it's fashion project manager: No it's fashion , yeah . industrial designer: and it's related to how beautiful it is or  if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . industrial designer: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so .  , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager: marketing: So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and  i i it sounds good technically user interface:  . marketing: but it's it's not what they want and  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Wha what we really see this year is that  everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer: Ah yes . marketing: okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . And then  if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . marketing: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion  from Milan and Paris industrial designer: And fruit and vegetables yeah . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer: Spongy 'Kay . industrial designer: Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing: Yeah thi this is this would be like  industrial designer: Pla S marketing: plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like  industrial designer: Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . marketing: Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager:  cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be  enough to have something working well . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: No wood but Plastic ? marketing: Maybe not no wood , but  ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer: Would some user interface: Pla project manager: Maybe you industrial designer: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . marketing: But still y project manager: Th The feeling is natural , industrial designer: Yeah , it's natural marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol marketing: Yeah ,  it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . marketing: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , industrial designer: Okay . project manager:  and what about the user interface concept ? industrial designer: Google and project manager: Google and fancy ? industrial designer: and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And project manager: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer:  maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested user interface:  yes . industrial designer: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: so . industrial designer: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . project manager: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , marketing: I dunno . project manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . project manager: Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . And pf what can we think a supplement to marketing: What interface ? project manager: Yeah , for the interface something added value . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use industrial designer: Yeah , yeah . So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the  simple vocal commands recognition . project manager:  you will have to work more , Baba , on the  spongy way to to add spongy  touch to the buttons industrial designer: expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new project manager: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . project manager: And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and  the colour of the  the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . project manager: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us  modelling a cl a clay remote control , user interface: Yeah . Yep project manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach "

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        " hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .  I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . project manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? user interface: Yes , I think so .  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . I just sent user interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , project manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , user interface: yeah . project manager:  and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . So I would say industrial designer: You said  targ target groups , project manager: yeah ? industrial designer: what does that mean ? project manager: As  who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , user interface:  industrial designer:  okay , 'kay . industrial designer: So are project manager: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on industrial designer: Okay .  so f from the project manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , user interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . So n  with  with regard to the  working design of this   remote control  I've identified  a few basic  components of the remote and  se  from the design , functional design perspective  w I c we can now  know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .  the identification of the components ,  and  since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person  and  from the user interface person . industrial designer: and  basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  so basically  the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  and what are the different processes  and how the parts  communicate with each other .  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .  also  the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features  makes it more comp complex . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing  with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .  also the management wants that  our design should be unique  it so it should incorporate  colour and the slogan  that our company  has it as its standard . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . So if  if this is our energy source and this is a cell ,  it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h  how how to do everything . So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,  which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .  so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do ,  make the chip more complicated  and bigger , basically .  so i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . And  also if we can incorporate  the latest features in our chip design , so that our   remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most  televisions . project manager: Do you have any  i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer: but  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so  I just identified the functional components for that . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some  design issues then I I I would like to continue project manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? user interface: okay , yeah . project manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . project manager: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you user interface: There's just nothing . project manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , user interface: Oh right , right , right ,  project manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . project manager: Now it's coming , industrial designer: It'll come up , it   no signal . user interface: No signal ? Why ? project manager: Maybe again ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now , user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again user interface: This is the problem , but project manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design  just like some some first issues that came up .  'kay , so the method I was  adopting at this point , it's not  for the for the whole  period of the  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . user interface:   my method was  to look at  other  remote controls ,  so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what  functionality they used . And then  after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web  just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what  what the user might desire as additional  functionalities . user interface:  so the findings  were  that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And  w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,  then the user would like to switch the channel  for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then   the other possibility would be that  she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .   I als industrial designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? user interface: okay .   among the findings I found that m m most of the curr  presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities  in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update  actually  we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . industrial designer: user interface: So my personal preferences would be  to keep the  the whole remote control small  just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions  like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .  then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then  other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then ,  for example brightness and  similar functions could be just  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n  more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . user interface: If you have questions project manager: If  that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . user interface: Yeah , and also it's it's  other question is  because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included marketing: project manager: user interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the   video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . industrial designer: project manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? industrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements    we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .  but  so so at this stage ,  how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  in we can completely do away with buttons and  have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But  is is there any   any thoughts on that ? user interface:  well , I think the buttons are still  kind of the most  easy for the user to use , industrial designer: Right . user interface:   what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user industrial designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . user interface: and and  the user just wants to get  get a result  quickly , not to spend time in like  giving several orders  I dunno . user interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other  proposals  . industrial designer:  I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . industrial designer:  i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: try to press project manager: Is it plugged in prop industrial designer: oh , okay , marketing: It's working . marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab  observed remote control use with  a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .  so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and  the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . project manager: marketing:  current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .  I dunno what zapping is , but project manager: It's  switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .  okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , industrial designer: Right .  but project manager: I liked the , I liked the litt marketing: ooh where's it go ? project manager: ooh come back . marketing:  okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . project manager: - , that's the next one along , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like  their importance , you know , project manager: marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , industrial designer: marketing:  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  that they get lost , that the  you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . marketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from  you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , project manager: The remote control . Okay , so   the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages industrial designer: Right . marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . Right ,  sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .  so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but  you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and  , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .  there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . marketing:  okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and  , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . industrial designer: marketing:  and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or industrial designer:  . marketing: not a mobile phone industrial designer: Some kind of a ring , project manager: Keys and things like that , industrial designer: some marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , industrial designer: Right . marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , project manager: marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . I think one of the very interesting things that came up in   Ka Kate Cat Cat's  presentation was   this this issue of   like voice recognition being more popular with  younger people . industrial designer: So if we need to have a target group  then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and  you know , good looking  we are better off targeting a younger audience then  you know , people who are comparatively elderly . marketing: Yeah ,  that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then  th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager: project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer: Right , and project manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . marketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know project manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah , project manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface: you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer: But  still , if if you can go back to that slide and  , how popular was it ? project manager: O oh it's on marketing: Oh , I've unplugged it . marketing: Do you want me to project manager: Here , let me industrial designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh   people between twenty five to thirty five ,  how popular was marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I kn  I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like  , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , project manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and marketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: you don't normally have a car , project manager: usually not a car and all of those things . industrial designer: So you're more likely to b marketing: so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing: No ,  that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , project manager: user interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full project manager: Yeah . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , project manager: But do they user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah user interface: Common , the students yeah , yeah . user interface: yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , industrial designer:  user interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ . marketing: industrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? project manager: marketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . user interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of   marketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . marketing: You know , so  that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . user interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer:  project manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on  m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p  things that Cat pointed out was   how do we go about implementing it ?  and  project manager: marketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like  every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , user interface: An industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , project manager:  . marketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know industrial designer: project manager: marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement  for for a limited user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface: Yeah but   Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager: Yeah , user interface: and  , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: What  user interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this  separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular  in the sense that  a person can say , I want to watch  I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . industrial designer: Yeah , so if  if something like that can be incorporated , marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . industrial designer: some kind of marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . marketing: Yeah , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: and that would be really annoying . user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just  speak into it project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager: So that you can yell at it , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think   the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer:  yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager:  . user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and  not to yell at it from the distance . So  wh another thing  that can be used is that  there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so you can go and press that button and  and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , project manager: project manager: but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , user interface: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface: The major ones , yeah . project manager:  but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning  . project manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break industrial designer: project manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . project manager:  I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . industrial designer: So where exactly is this i project manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . user interface: Did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah in that one , user interface: It's just yeah , yeah . marketing: Oh , so y you want our  PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager: Yeah , that would be great . user interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , project manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . project manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . project manager:  as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . marketing: project manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface:  something conceptual , yeah . project manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that marketing: project manager:  we'll keep keep our options op  ? industrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . user interface: Sorry , but  the next meeting  are we going to have it  right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . project manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . project manager: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? marketing: user interface: Okay , see you ."

Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So  here we have our detailed design meeting where we will  look at the prototype and  right so  , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary marketing: project manager: and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go  just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . user interface: project manager: This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So  basically the moral of the story from our last minute  last meeting was that  we that we had meetings from  we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer ,  or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here  and what sort of limitations we're operating with   excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with  voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape  because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .  , and  the   the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . What's to be said about it ?  , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting ,  . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see project manager: This is going to be the on off button project manager: industrial designer: and we have these buttons to go through the channels  and then two volume buttons down here , d  we decided those were the most important  buttons . And then , for the more advanced  functions there is a slide out panel here  and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away ,  . As far as the  whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , user interface: marketing: Ah . user interface: industrial designer: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . user interface: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about  you know the the interchangeable  faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here marketing:  . user interface: of course that's  interchangeable industrial designer: user interface: and  I think it would be desirable for the  for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued marketing:  'kay . user interface:  and as you can see on the television there  we have the  voice detector device  on the top there .  , what other things do we see here , well ,  if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , project manager: user interface: so I think that will work well with regards to our market .  and  let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .   do you have anything else to add to that ? industrial designer:  I worried about the materials , it is  the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable  , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .  , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . user interface: It's actually important to note that the television ,  you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: marketing: industrial designer: Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the  the company's name on the telephone screen , project manager: Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok industrial designer: I thought that was kinda nice . marketing: project manager: industrial designer: This user interface: marketing: Do we need to worry about  rot factors ? project manager: user interface:  it's encased in a new  type of  marketing: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: we don't need to worry , industrial designer: We got a bit ahead of ourselves , user interface: It's fine . industrial designer: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but user interface:  . user interface: but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , project manager: Brilliant . user interface:  I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that  whether we need to worry about any  other marketing areas or anything of that nature . This cost well to put this into  production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro  and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . industrial designer: One thing that we didn't do  obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and  since we did that marketing:  . industrial designer: we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . industrial designer: So even though it has a lot of modern technology ,  for example the voice recognition , marketing:  . industrial designer: in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and  I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers  we might be able to get even cheaper . Did we talk about the voice recognition  option ? industrial designer: And Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? user interface: So  so  yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition   console project manager: marketing: Okay . user interface: but basically the voice recognition  incorporates  the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw  come up with . industrial designer: Any questions ? project manager: No , no marketing: Do we have  other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? project manager: I think that's user interface: marketing: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? industrial designer: do you wanna answer this one marketing: Do we know where we stand on that yet ? industrial designer: or do you want me to answer it ? user interface: Well we didn't quite have enough material  . user interface: Oh I see , marketing: I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . industrial designer: well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and  it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like marketing: Okay . marketing: And the whole thing project manager: marketing: Okay user interface: So  there are I marketing: Right user interface: we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look  materials marketing: Yeah . We also continued on with the ideas that f following  Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the  light orange and the green . industrial designer: It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough marketing: Okay . industrial designer: that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way marketing: Okay .  , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it ,  I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . project manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ? industrial designer: Right project manager: With a back-up battery ? industrial designer:  we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , project manager: With the ba okay .  so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a  It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah .  and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general industrial designer: Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . Push button interface  with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? industrial designer: Yeah , And  a special I guess it's  we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , industrial designer: Yeah , special . industrial designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , project manager: Yeah , it's it's quite unique . project manager: I like it , yeah it's So it looks like marketing: M come in at sixteen ? project manager: a bit over budget ,  . Huh , doesn't match up does it ? user interface: marketing: project manager: So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells  or take out the back-up battery .  industrial designer: How do you feel about that ? user interface:  I think that  if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . industrial designer:  we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working user interface: project manager: industrial designer: it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the  to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , marketing: Nah . project manager: it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way .  if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it ,  user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental  obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . user interface:  you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing marketing:  user interface:  that's what sets us apart marketing: Which , it's user interface: right ? marketing: yeah that's what setting us into this young market ,  that's where we started from , so I don't know , and  you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . user interface: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the  the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here marketing: Right . user interface: and  you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here project manager: It's either or . industrial designer: It's the only way we're gonna get below our  goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty . project manager: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're industrial designer: Yeah , . marketing: It kind of project manager:  and we can't get rid of the   removing the user interface: Savings . project manager: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a - , nor would changing the case materials .  , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . project manager: That'd be great industrial designer: user interface: marketing: I didn't even do that one on purpose either , user interface: marketing: damn . Okay , basically I was just evaluating  from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .  so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ?  . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . marketing: the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface ,  that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . It looks like it's going over well , so user interface: And the paging function works well , industrial designer: Six ? user interface: that's good to hear , marketing: we're we're good yeah . It's I think eventually if we do  branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into  wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . industrial designer: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel marketing: That's everything from me . marketing: Yeah , it is a set-back , but industrial designer: marketing: Okay , do you need the cord back ? project manager:  yeah , user interface: W we might have  we might have lost that granola market again project manager: I was just go on . user interface: that we're project manager: Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? industrial designer: True .  so I guess we are going to discuss  our project process  marketing: industrial designer: user interface: project manager: and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go   out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess ,  . industrial designer: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or marketing: Okay . marketing: It is now , industrial designer: user interface: marketing: you're in charge there you go . so user interface: project manager: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . project manager:  right ,  so any thoughts ? industrial designer: Are we considering these points here ? marketing:  . project manager: What do you guys feel about the process ? industrial designer: marketing: you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , project manager: and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . We could now if that'd make up for it user interface: And marketing: but really industrial designer: marketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . user interface: also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . marketing: Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual industrial designer: Yeah , it's true . project manager: marketing: Yeah , but I didn't get a response industrial designer: What if you get a response two or three months from now ? user interface: marketing: so project manager: marketing: we'll see . industrial designer: marketing: Well user interface: industrial designer: marketing: what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: I so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I don't we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us ,  . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: marketing: And highly resourceful team mates might I add industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: industrial designer: I guess user interface: industrial designer: My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , project manager: user interface: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . industrial designer: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , project manager: marketing: Do your own . marketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . marketing:  maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . marketing: Nothing , I didn't even get an email , user interface: marketing: like industrial designer: marketing: that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . user interface: Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to marketing: Whatever . user interface: well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing industrial designer:  . industrial designer: You know user interface:  and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was marketing:  . user interface: but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , industrial designer: Yeah . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you user interface: which was fine . industrial designer: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . project manager: She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . That's kind of a good thing though , project manager: I felt like I slipped into it a lot . user interface: An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? project manager: The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . project manager: it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , user interface: project manager: you know ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? marketing: Yeah . user interface: marketing: and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , industrial designer: user interface: I had to admit , as soon as w we started  as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . industrial designer: project manager: Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , user interface: Possibly . project manager: like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos user interface: Oh yeah , marketing: Yeah . project manager:  you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: I think so . user interface: project manager: No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , industrial designer: You don't . project manager: I don't I I was just I marketing: Though we didn't actually  other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: It's true huh ? marketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . user interface: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like  . industrial designer: project manager: It d marketing: Yeah that is kind of project manager: But yeah . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ?  the whole process of industrial designer: Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? project manager: I don't know . I I don't know if there was a ri I th marketing: Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , industrial designer: Yeah , that's it marketing: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . industrial designer: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , project manager: Nor I . marketing:  I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . user interface:  it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . project manager: I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized marketing: I know . industrial designer: Yeah , project manager: just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because user interface: marketing: I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . user interface: So is this all we need to get through ? project manager: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . user interface: Is it marketing: It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? project manager: Well , that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , marketing: That slide was like that ? project manager: user interface: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? project manager: W I kinda like th industrial designer: No , none . user interface: project manager: Yeah you can't industrial designer: I think they're fine actually . marketing: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form project manager: Yeah . project manager: Does kinda make you wonder , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can marketing: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , project manager: Yeah . user interface: What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? project manager: So this was other costs . I think this is marketing: Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? project manager: forty ish marketing: How much time do we have left ? project manager: I I I  we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval ,  . project manager: you know what is marketing: Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work project manager: Yep . marketing: and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway user interface: Why ? project manager: Hey . marketing: like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . industrial designer: Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . user interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation industrial designer: Yeah . I di user interface: Oh I added like five slides too , marketing: See project manager: Oh . industrial designer: I just got blank ones project manager: What ? Really ? industrial designer: and marketing: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe user interface: Yeah , mine too . project manager: yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , marketing: Like with those words already on it ? project manager: literally , just like that . user interface: I added many slides every time marketing: Hey industrial designer: marketing: with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . project manager: industrial designer: I think it would fail , I think marketing: I can't just leave it there . project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . marketing: I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . user interface: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to  fr some other design  modifications . user interface: I hope you appreciate the  incorporation of some tin foil from a  random Kit-Kat bar project manager: marketing: I I noticed that . industrial designer: Yeah , it's  user interface: So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . You know from the the the basics to the conce industrial designer: I wanna see a marketing: I Yeah . project manager: although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . project manager: yeah  i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . project manager: maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . industrial designer: So we have more slides or ? marketing: project manager: No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it marketing: We got it to be . project manager: We did the project evaluation based on  Sarah's evaluation of on off switches marketing: Like cutting corners . Kind of , project manager: and marketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . marketing: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . project manager: I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . marketing: I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that project manager: Oh yeah . project manager: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . user interface: What the uhs and the marketing: There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . industrial designer: Filler words or ? project manager: Yep , they're called  disfluencies . industrial designer: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so  I do the marketing: Yeah , we are addicts . user interface: Well just around that eight or or nine people that are project manager: I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? marketing: Yeah . project manager: you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . project manager: No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know  ubiquitous marketing: I yeah . marketing: But it's not regular  my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . user interface: In the eighties ? marketing: My  grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had  an E_D_U_ and gov network . marketing: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't  household to household yet user interface: Right . marketing: because it hadn't been user interface: Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . project manager: 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: Where do you find that ? marketing: I have no idea . user interface: industrial designer: Is that the only song you have ? user interface: There is another one . project manager: Is this one of those media player ? industrial designer: marketing: user interface: Huh ? project manager: W oh . project manager: That's one that seems to be shipping with it  shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . marketing: So is that a close ? project manager: Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner "

        "industrial designer: project manager: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . And  so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . industrial designer: You can  choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . industrial designer: You have on the  on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . user interface: industrial designer: And here the the switch that control if you want project manager: Why you why you you put it in the the side ? industrial designer: Well I I I think  it's the project manager: It's not a good place maybe . industrial designer: Yeah but user interface: No i i it's the all around camer  microphone isn't it . marketing: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? industrial designer: Well so it's a microphone array . industrial designer: No user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's just a single microphone , and you I I think  we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to user interface:  . industrial designer: well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . industrial designer: And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker  recognition system to  to be on or off . project manager: How much does it cost this one ? industrial designer: Well this this prototype is  made for about  well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars user interface: For the project manager: Fifteen dollars ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: fifteen dollars , project manager: Ah it's above it's above the budget . industrial designer: but  well it's not it's not  yeah , but  it's just a prototype and if we  if we optimises the  the  voila . project manager: How many b battery is there ? industrial designer: How many , excuse me ? project manager: Battery . industrial designer: Well  f battery , we use  about  user interface: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . industrial designer: Yeah and you just project manager: So one one battery ? industrial designer: On  yeah one battery . industrial designer: marketing: user interface: You just n  marketing: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? industrial designer: The excuse me ? marketing: Whole day's rating . user interface: marketing: What type of battery ? industrial designer: Oh yeah it's just a r  simple battery a rechargeable  user interface: Yeah yeah . industrial designer: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Then the next time you pick it , oh project manager: industrial designer: it works . user interface: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button industrial designer: Yeah just explain the button  Norman . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , industrial designer: user interface: you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . industrial designer: user interface: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . marketing: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: project manager: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah it's project manager: industrial designer: So we have the the second version also with the different  button configuration . marketing: industrial designer: So basically th it's the same  marketing: -huh and also the switch . user interface: marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , user interface: Oh no marketing: because that's a major that's a user interface: th actually th we'll come to that point in our industrial designer: Yeah it's it's it's embed in the  speech recognition system . marketing: Okay industrial designer: So marketing: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? user interface: W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . user interface: Th they either these with the  the the charger any project manager: With the remote control . project manager: Okay so the price of the charger included in the user interface:  it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price  . user interface: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but  again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but project manager: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Yeah project manager: Well that's so user interface: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . project manager: We have we have just marketing: Yeah people are willing to pay more , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . project manager: And the price of production user interface: industrial designer: Alright please  go on Norman with the special features . marketing: Or  user interface: Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , marketing: user interface: so is  modular . user interface: Yeah yeah , project manager: user interface: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , marketing: Something like customised . industrial designer: user interface: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . industrial designer: You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control project manager: But user interface:  yeah yeah you should present that . industrial designer: that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control marketing: And this is other one ? user interface: industrial designer: i i if you  if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and  which channel you want to choose and so on . industrial designer: H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , marketing:     . industrial designer: they just plug in it user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and they can have all the control they want here . industrial designer: We also have this module for  old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , user interface:  . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the  the same powerful functionalities . So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our  an innovation   i in this  design here . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop industrial designer: user interface: it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? industrial designer: The titanium project manager: Titanium . industrial designer: and so it's very  user interface: Again  and the battery life is  is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . user interface: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then  y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,  and then there's this message coming out that  please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it marketing: Okay . Yeah and  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define marketing:     . user interface: so sorry ? project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface: And then  because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . project manager: What what's user interface: Maybe we can improve more on the design but project manager: Maybe yeah . industrial designer: project manager: What's the price to p to produce ? user interface:  this is the industrial designer: Well so the price to produce For  the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . project manager: With with with the charge ? industrial designer:  it's about it The without without the charger marketing: With the charger ? project manager: Okay . user interface: Yeah industrial designer: it's about  well two dollars to produce  the microphone and speech recognition systems . user interface: industrial designer: Two dollars for the  for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . So if you  sum up  everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . industrial designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about  fifteen dollars . project manager: No it's industrial designer: But it's just if you want all functionalities . user interface: marketing: Yeah it's a nice input project manager: We marketing: but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . project manager: marketing: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu user interface: Yeah . user interface: marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and  very handy to hold . user interface: marketing: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . industrial designer: Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen   with just four buttons . marketing: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . marketing: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . user interface: But the the problem is that  is it robust to mishandling ? industrial designer: Okay . user interface: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . user interface: marketing: So these are the f  three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . marketing: say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , user interface: industrial designer: marketing: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , user interface:  . marketing: so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks  it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So user interface: So marketing: We can make our study on this and user interface: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? marketing: No no we have you have designed two products now , project manager: Yeah . user interface: But who will give the scoring  we ourself or or a third party ? project manager: You . marketing: According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it  with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? user interface:  . marketing: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? industrial designer: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . marketing: And you both agree for that ? project manager: And you ? user interface: I think we can improve on the design . It's it it project manager: user interface:  we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . marketing: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: Yeah a three . marketing: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? user interface: Yeah . I think it's it's  more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated marketing: Four . industrial designer: so removing the L_C_D_  gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . industrial designer: Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . marketing: Five with L_C_D_ and user interface: industrial designer: Well five also  Norman please . user interface: Yeah project manager:  user interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that  what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that  the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because  that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've  A lot of functionalities . user interface: So that is  that is  for both th marketing: So without L_C_D_ ? user interface: Our gi I think that the our our product is  has the best in all well this is a biased judgement industrial designer: user interface: because we designed them . marketing: No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: And without L_C_D_ ? industrial designer:  for both it's the the same innovations . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y industrial designer: Yeah . user interface:    there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? marketing: So we can't go project manager: industrial designer: Talk about user interface: We haven't really  determined what are actually actually project manager: marketing:  that what you are sayin that's what the design user interface: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? industrial designer: marketing: No it's like this , project manager: marketing:  on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Yeah but industrial designer: Yeah project manager: But industrial designer: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . marketing: No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . industrial designer: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n marketing: L_C_D_ ? Then  there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . marketing: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a user interface: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . marketing:  that depends upon your design , so user interface: Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , marketing:  user interface: we give what the customer  wants , right . user interface: marketing: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? user interface: industrial designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , user interface: Yeah industrial designer: and  well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product user interface: industrial designer: so I will give a six for the easy to use . user interface: Yeah I think project manager: No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . project manager: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , marketing: Yeah . project manager: and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be user interface: Yeah . marketing: Or we can just go back to the previous slide  where we ha we have a few updates . S industrial designer: And  if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to  for the shape and  things like that so marketing: Yeah that's right . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , marketing: Yeah yeah that's right .  we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but  what I'm trying to say here is that the  we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . marketing: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? project manager: user interface: W  marketing: Or you want it to be six ? user interface: I think it's the same . industrial designer: Yes as you say , with better  project manager: Without L_C_D_ . marketing: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: so let's go back to our laboratory and user interface: To improve on the design . project manager: what about the integration of speech recognition ? user interface: Huh ? The speech recogniser is a add-on module . industrial designer: It's optional yeah , since well according to this study  people more likes more to have a spongy  remote control than project manager: I think it will be I think i user interface: marketing: Yeah . project manager: I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these  marketing: Yeah , but  if you have an add-ons , the kids may just  hide the parental module project manager: Yeah . project manager: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , industrial designer: project manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same marketing: In the same set , yeah , project manager: marketing: and and individual buttons to make them work . user interface: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . I don't know , project manager: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional  will be optional . user interface: what do you think  ? Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . project manager:  marketing:  how to how to how to make a marketing survey that  how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ user interface: Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? project manager: I think it inc increase . industrial designer: Oh no , project manager: industrial designer: because if you if you add  something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces  to to to build but project manager:  . industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah user interface: industrial designer: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities  on the same module , but  user interface:  . marketing: On the same P_C_B_ user interface: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . industrial designer: user interface: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m project manager: marketing: Updates and we sell it . industrial designer: user interface: Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? project manager: industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And  what's the idea about  the shape of the remote controls ? industrial designer: Well so marketing:  can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah marketing: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and industrial designer: I think we are yeah but we are also the  well the components will have to change because  we have to deal with the shape and  but I don't think it will  increase the cost too much so user interface:  . marketing: Or  it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior  shape is different o for all . industrial designer:  well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to  ah well user interface: Yeah . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin marketing: Yeah , yeah that's right . industrial designer: and then  add on skins and with with this  tex spongy texture  things like that . project manager: So industrial designer: So we finished the prototype  presentation if you have  something else to say . user interface: marketing: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . We have to give answers so marketing: user interface: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? project manager: Project evaluation . This room is a bit small , but industrial designer: project manager: user interface: but I think it's okay for us to work with . marketing: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need  I think it's okay . marketing:   what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? user interface:  we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . industrial designer: Yeah and also more well  more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have  clear clear points whenever we do a meeting marketing: user interface:  . industrial designer:  prior to the meeting to have  well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . marketing: And the evaluation was project manager: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . marketing: So project manager: Yeah free free coffee user interface: Alright then , we finished ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: Yeah thank you for your work and marketing: Yeah thank you , thank you very much "

        "And  I want to introduce myself ,  my name is  Shrida Daseri and  I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . And what you're  drawing ? user interface:  sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and  we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about  this project and the the project initiation . First of all I want to ask  Mister Ed about your  marketing plan and your product plan and  marketing: Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . project manager: - but  do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or marketing:  for the moment not yet . project manager: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but  what's what's your  do you have some project plan , something with you or marketing: Good question . No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . Okay , so  by when you think you can  give me some kind of  project plan , okay , a discussion with  marketing: Certainly by the next meeting .  Okay , so there's any questions or  first of all about  this project ? industrial designer: What is the goal of the project ? project manager:  the goal of the project I think maybe I'll  hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain  what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . marketing: industrial designer: marketing: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . We have to define exactly what our product is , from  project manager: Yes , so can you explain  what exactly the product is ? marketing: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? project manager: Oh I think  , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so project manager: Yes . marketing: Something  visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , project manager: marketing: because I think everybody's experienced with  remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth  throwing out the window .  th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , project manager: marketing: 'cause a lot of times  spend  half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . project manager: And  what abo  Christine , what about your  the industrial design plan ? Are you have a design already on this product or  you're still working on the design ? industrial designer:  no , I I have not begun working on the design , project manager: industrial designer: and  I  I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor .  the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a   some sort of a seven inch  monitor , and  I understood that that was the project goal . So  I'm glad I didn't d do any work  ahead of time because  I clearly didn't understand the project goal . industrial designer:  I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and  that's about  that's project manager: industrial designer: and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . project manager: So  you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? industrial designer:  for the industrial design ? project manager: Yes . marketing: project manager: That's industrial designer:  because  , you know , you can  you can make it  you have different choices with different financial models . project manager: Yeah , but  before we talk about  the finance , okay ,  do you have some idea how we can  sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and  of course it's to the individual also . industrial designer: Well , you know  , I kind of think that in general you have to do   y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's  very attractive that  people see and recognize  its goal , and  they immediately wanna have it  have one of their own . So it would really would need to  something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , project manager: industrial designer: so  d  you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . project manager: Okay , but   when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? industrial designer: Well ,  I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now  and so I'll have to wait and see how those  how those go . project manager: Yeah , but  I need something in the writing , so like  what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and  how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe  initial budget you're looking , okay , and  how is going to the market , okay , industrial designer: project manager: so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and  you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of   the plan in the writing from you . Okay , and it's po industrial designer: And when would you like that ? project manager: B as soon as possible . industrial designer:  well if  if we have enough time  then d do you think  two weeks is a is close enough ? project manager: Yes I think  that would be good , because I need to go to the management and  tell them what we are going to do , and  what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because  without any  documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need  some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . industrial designer:  are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? project manager: Yes , of course , if you need some help ,  so let me know . So , who are the people you need  from the marketing or  the technical side or  the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , industrial designer: project manager: so just let me know so I can  coordinate all the teams . And  Ed  so what's what do you think about  this  project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or  the sales strategy ? marketing: Well not yet other than  doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do  , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , project manager:  . marketing: It should be a fairly large market because  the number of people that  the competition , project manager: marketing:  th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . project manager: Yes , so what I  prefer maybe  you need to interact  more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because  she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , marketing: Yeah . project manager: so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . project manager: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and  within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , marketing: project manager: and  you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th marketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much  we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , project manager: Th That that's marketing: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? project manager: Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you  both of  the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . Then  we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . Okay , so I think it's  maybe if we can  give me some kind of your  the sales plan , okay , including the technical what  she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . Okay , and if you need  any coordination in between  compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some   marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .  my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . user interface: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , project manager: Th Christine , yeah . Which is user interface: and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , user interface: Yeah . project manager: then you will user interface: Which will also feed into the marketing , project manager: Yes . user interface: because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .  , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your  meeting and Christine meeting , because  he should know what's happening . Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . user interface: So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or project manager: Yes . To come up with the functional design and  to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and  first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , user interface: industrial designer: Would you mind  at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? project manager: Yes , I will . project manager: I'll copy ,  le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? user interface: Sure . project manager: And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or  just come and  knock my door , okay , so I'm available here "

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        " hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .  I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . project manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? user interface: Yes , I think so .  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . I just sent user interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , project manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , user interface: yeah . project manager:  and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . So I would say industrial designer: You said  targ target groups , project manager: yeah ? industrial designer: what does that mean ? project manager: As  who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , user interface:  industrial designer:  okay , 'kay . industrial designer: So are project manager: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on industrial designer: Okay .  so f from the project manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , user interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . So n  with  with regard to the  working design of this   remote control  I've identified  a few basic  components of the remote and  se  from the design , functional design perspective  w I c we can now  know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .  the identification of the components ,  and  since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person  and  from the user interface person . industrial designer: and  basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  so basically  the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  and what are the different processes  and how the parts  communicate with each other .  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .  also  the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features  makes it more comp complex . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing  with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .  also the management wants that  our design should be unique  it so it should incorporate  colour and the slogan  that our company  has it as its standard . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . So if  if this is our energy source and this is a cell ,  it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h  how how to do everything . So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,  which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .  so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do ,  make the chip more complicated  and bigger , basically .  so i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . And  also if we can incorporate  the latest features in our chip design , so that our   remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most  televisions . project manager: Do you have any  i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer: but  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so  I just identified the functional components for that . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some  design issues then I I I would like to continue project manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? user interface: okay , yeah . project manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . project manager: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you user interface: There's just nothing . project manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , user interface: Oh right , right , right ,  project manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . project manager: Now it's coming , industrial designer: It'll come up , it   no signal . user interface: No signal ? Why ? project manager: Maybe again ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now , user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again user interface: This is the problem , but project manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design  just like some some first issues that came up .  'kay , so the method I was  adopting at this point , it's not  for the for the whole  period of the  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . user interface:   my method was  to look at  other  remote controls ,  so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what  functionality they used . And then  after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web  just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what  what the user might desire as additional  functionalities . user interface:  so the findings  were  that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And  w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,  then the user would like to switch the channel  for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then   the other possibility would be that  she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .   I als industrial designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? user interface: okay .   among the findings I found that m m most of the curr  presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities  in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update  actually  we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . industrial designer: user interface: So my personal preferences would be  to keep the  the whole remote control small  just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions  like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .  then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then  other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then ,  for example brightness and  similar functions could be just  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n  more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . user interface: If you have questions project manager: If  that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . user interface: Yeah , and also it's it's  other question is  because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included marketing: project manager: user interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the   video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . industrial designer: project manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? industrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements    we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .  but  so so at this stage ,  how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  in we can completely do away with buttons and  have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But  is is there any   any thoughts on that ? user interface:  well , I think the buttons are still  kind of the most  easy for the user to use , industrial designer: Right . user interface:   what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user industrial designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . user interface: and and  the user just wants to get  get a result  quickly , not to spend time in like  giving several orders  I dunno . user interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other  proposals  . industrial designer:  I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . industrial designer:  i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: try to press project manager: Is it plugged in prop industrial designer: oh , okay , marketing: It's working . marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab  observed remote control use with  a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .  so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and  the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . project manager: marketing:  current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .  I dunno what zapping is , but project manager: It's  switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .  okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , industrial designer: Right .  but project manager: I liked the , I liked the litt marketing: ooh where's it go ? project manager: ooh come back . marketing:  okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . project manager: - , that's the next one along , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like  their importance , you know , project manager: marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , industrial designer: marketing:  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  that they get lost , that the  you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . marketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from  you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , project manager: The remote control . Okay , so   the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages industrial designer: Right . marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . Right ,  sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .  so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but  you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and  , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .  there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . marketing:  okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and  , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . industrial designer: marketing:  and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or industrial designer:  . marketing: not a mobile phone industrial designer: Some kind of a ring , project manager: Keys and things like that , industrial designer: some marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , industrial designer: Right . marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , project manager: marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . I think one of the very interesting things that came up in   Ka Kate Cat Cat's  presentation was   this this issue of   like voice recognition being more popular with  younger people . industrial designer: So if we need to have a target group  then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and  you know , good looking  we are better off targeting a younger audience then  you know , people who are comparatively elderly . marketing: Yeah ,  that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then  th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager: project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer: Right , and project manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . marketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know project manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah , project manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface: you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer: But  still , if if you can go back to that slide and  , how popular was it ? project manager: O oh it's on marketing: Oh , I've unplugged it . marketing: Do you want me to project manager: Here , let me industrial designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh   people between twenty five to thirty five ,  how popular was marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I kn  I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like  , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , project manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and marketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: you don't normally have a car , project manager: usually not a car and all of those things . industrial designer: So you're more likely to b marketing: so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing: No ,  that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , project manager: user interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full project manager: Yeah . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , project manager: But do they user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah user interface: Common , the students yeah , yeah . user interface: yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , industrial designer:  user interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ . marketing: industrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? project manager: marketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . user interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of   marketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . marketing: You know , so  that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . user interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer:  project manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on  m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p  things that Cat pointed out was   how do we go about implementing it ?  and  project manager: marketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like  every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , user interface: An industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , project manager:  . marketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know industrial designer: project manager: marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement  for for a limited user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface: Yeah but   Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager: Yeah , user interface: and  , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: What  user interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this  separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular  in the sense that  a person can say , I want to watch  I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . industrial designer: Yeah , so if  if something like that can be incorporated , marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . industrial designer: some kind of marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . marketing: Yeah , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: and that would be really annoying . user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just  speak into it project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager: So that you can yell at it , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think   the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer:  yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager:  . user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and  not to yell at it from the distance . So  wh another thing  that can be used is that  there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so you can go and press that button and  and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , project manager: project manager: but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , user interface: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface: The major ones , yeah . project manager:  but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning  . project manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break industrial designer: project manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . project manager:  I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . industrial designer: So where exactly is this i project manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . user interface: Did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah in that one , user interface: It's just yeah , yeah . marketing: Oh , so y you want our  PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager: Yeah , that would be great . user interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , project manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . project manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . project manager:  as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . marketing: project manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface:  something conceptual , yeah . project manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that marketing: project manager:  we'll keep keep our options op  ? industrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . user interface: Sorry , but  the next meeting  are we going to have it  right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . project manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . project manager: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? marketing: user interface: Okay , see you ."

        " hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .  I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . project manager: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? user interface: Yes , I think so .  I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . I just sent user interface: Yeah , the last minute , yeah , project manager: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , user interface: yeah . project manager:  and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . So I would say industrial designer: You said  targ target groups , project manager: yeah ? industrial designer: what does that mean ? project manager: As  who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , user interface:  industrial designer:  okay , 'kay . industrial designer: So are project manager: So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on industrial designer: Okay .  so f from the project manager: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , user interface: Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . So n  with  with regard to the  working design of this   remote control  I've identified  a few basic  components of the remote and  se  from the design , functional design perspective  w I c we can now  know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .  the identification of the components ,  and  since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person  and  from the user interface person . industrial designer: and  basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .  so basically  the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  and what are the different processes  and how the parts  communicate with each other .  okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .  also  the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features  makes it more comp complex . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing  with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple .  also the management wants that  our design should be unique  it so it should incorporate  colour and the slogan  that our company  has it as its standard . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . So if  if this is our energy source and this is a cell ,  it communicates  it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h  how how to do everything . So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,  which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .  so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do ,  make the chip more complicated  and bigger , basically .  so i in my personal preferences  I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . And  also if we can incorporate  the latest features in our chip design , so that our   remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most  televisions . project manager: Do you have any  i idea about costs at this point ? industrial designer: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . industrial designer: but  unfortunately I I do not have any data , so  I just identified the functional components for that . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? user interface: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some  design issues then I I I would like to continue project manager: Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? user interface: okay , yeah . project manager: Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . project manager: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you user interface: There's just nothing . project manager: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , user interface: Oh right , right , right ,  project manager: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . project manager: Now it's coming , industrial designer: It'll come up , it   no signal . user interface: No signal ? Why ? project manager: Maybe again ? industrial designer: Yeah yeah , it says something now , user interface: Oh . project manager: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again user interface: This is the problem , but project manager: there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design  just like some some first issues that came up .  'kay , so the method I was  adopting at this point , it's not  for the for the whole  period of the  all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . user interface:   my method was  to look at  other  remote controls ,  so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what  functionality they used . And then  after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web  just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what  what the user might desire as additional  functionalities . user interface:  so the findings  were  that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And  w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,  then the user would like to switch the channel  for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then   the other possibility would be that  she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .   I als industrial designer: Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? user interface: okay .   among the findings I found that m m most of the curr  presently available remote controls also include other  functionalities  in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update  actually  we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . industrial designer: user interface: So my personal preferences would be  to keep the  the whole remote control small  just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions  like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .  then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then  the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then  other functionalities  could be just  there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then ,  for example brightness and  similar functions could be just  done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n  more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . user interface: If you have questions project manager: If  that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . user interface: Yeah , and also it's it's  other question is  because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included marketing: project manager: user interface: because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the   video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . industrial designer: project manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? industrial designer: So in the u user interface requirements    we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .  but  so so at this stage ,  how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or  in we can completely do away with buttons and  have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But  is is there any   any thoughts on that ? user interface:  well , I think the buttons are still  kind of the most  easy for the user to use , industrial designer: Right . user interface:   what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user industrial designer: Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . user interface: and and  the user just wants to get  get a result  quickly , not to spend time in like  giving several orders  I dunno . user interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other  proposals  . industrial designer:  I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . industrial designer:  i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: try to press project manager: Is it plugged in prop industrial designer: oh , okay , marketing: It's working . marketing: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab  observed remote control use with  a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire .  so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and  the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . project manager: marketing:  current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .  I dunno what zapping is , but project manager: It's  switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .  okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , industrial designer: Right .  but project manager: I liked the , I liked the litt marketing: ooh where's it go ? project manager: ooh come back . marketing:  okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . marketing: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . project manager: - , that's the next one along , yeah ? marketing: Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like  their importance , you know , project manager: marketing: and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , industrial designer: marketing:  and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . marketing: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .  that they get lost , that the  you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . marketing: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from  you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , project manager: The remote control . Okay , so   the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages industrial designer: Right . marketing: you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . Right ,  sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it .  so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but  you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and  , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool .  there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . marketing:  okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and  , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . industrial designer: marketing:  and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or industrial designer:  . marketing: not a mobile phone industrial designer: Some kind of a ring , project manager: Keys and things like that , industrial designer: some marketing: Yeah , that's it , you know . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , industrial designer: Right . marketing: 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , project manager: marketing: 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . I think one of the very interesting things that came up in   Ka Kate Cat Cat's  presentation was   this this issue of   like voice recognition being more popular with  younger people . industrial designer: So if we need to have a target group  then  I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and  you know , good looking  we are better off targeting a younger audience then  you know , people who are comparatively elderly . marketing: Yeah ,  that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , industrial designer: Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so if you want to put in something stylish , then  th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , project manager: project manager: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket industrial designer: Right , and project manager: and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . marketing: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know project manager: Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah , project manager: I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and user interface: you share a television or something that yeah . industrial designer: But  still , if if you can go back to that slide and  , how popular was it ? project manager: O oh it's on marketing: Oh , I've unplugged it . marketing: Do you want me to project manager: Here , let me industrial designer: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh   people between twenty five to thirty five ,  how popular was marketing: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , I kn  I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , project manager: Yeah . marketing: but  it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like  , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , project manager: Yeah , they've got no commitments and marketing: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , industrial designer: Alright . marketing: you don't normally have a car , project manager: usually not a car and all of those things . industrial designer: So you're more likely to b marketing: so that just costs more than a car , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . marketing: No ,  that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think project manager: Yeah . user interface: Yeah this this is not unaffordable , project manager: user interface: but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full project manager: Yeah . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , project manager: But do they user interface: Yeah . project manager: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah user interface: Common , the students yeah , yeah . user interface: yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , industrial designer:  user interface: it might not even function with the old T_V_ . marketing: industrial designer: Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? project manager: marketing: Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . user interface: Or w maybe we can just kind of   marketing: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . marketing: You know , so  that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . user interface: Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , user interface: Yeah . industrial designer:  project manager: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? industrial designer: I was having a a general outlook on  m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p  things that Cat pointed out was   how do we go about implementing it ?  and  project manager: marketing: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like  every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . With  but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , user interface: An industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , project manager:  . marketing: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know industrial designer: project manager: marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . industrial designer: Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement  for for a limited user interface: Yeah . project manager: so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , user interface: Yeah but   Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . user interface: Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons project manager: Yeah , user interface: and  , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , industrial designer:  . industrial designer: What  user interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . industrial designer: What wh  what I was thinking is that there is this  separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular  in the sense that  a person can say , I want to watch  I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . industrial designer: Yeah , so if  if something like that can be incorporated , marketing: Yeah , that would be another way to do it . industrial designer: some kind of marketing: Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because  Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , project manager: Yeah . marketing: so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . marketing: Yeah , yeah , industrial designer: Yeah , that's marketing: and that would be really annoying . user interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just  speak into it project manager: Yeah . user interface: and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? project manager: So that you can yell at it , industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . marketing: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . user interface: Yeah , but then the remote control I think   the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . marketing: Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then industrial designer:  yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control project manager:  . user interface: No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and  not to yell at it from the distance . So  wh another thing  that can be used is that  there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: so you can go and press that button and  and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , project manager: project manager: but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , user interface: Oh yeah , yeah . project manager: some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . marketing: Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . But if we go away with that that kind of general  specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option user interface: The major ones , yeah . project manager:  but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning  . project manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break industrial designer: project manager: and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . project manager:  I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . industrial designer: So where exactly is this i project manager: It should be on your desktop , so on the industrial designer: Ah , okay . project manager: So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . user interface: Did you find it ? industrial designer: Yeah , yeah in that one , user interface: It's just yeah , yeah . marketing: Oh , so y you want our  PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? project manager: Yeah , that would be great . user interface: Oh so so we'll just put them i there , project manager: Oh yeah , put them in there . project manager: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . project manager:  as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . marketing: project manager: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , user interface:  something conceptual , yeah . project manager: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that marketing: project manager:  we'll keep keep our options op  ? industrial designer: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . user interface: Sorry , but  the next meeting  are we going to have it  right after lunch or shall we prepare our project manager: No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , user interface: To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . project manager: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . project manager: Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? marketing: user interface: Okay , see you ."

        "Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work? julie morgan am: Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it\u2019s important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. hefin david am: So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development? julie morgan am: No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. julie morgan am: The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it\u2019s probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do. hefin david am: And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government\u2019s approach 'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.' And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen? julie morgan am: Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it\u2019s absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it\u2019s grown up from all different routes. We have got pathway projects in, I think it\u2019s eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things. Can I just come back to the first thing you said: 'We can't say yet what we're going to do'? julie morgan am: No. hefin david am: So, when will we have a policy plan and something that we can interrogate in more detail? julie morgan am: Well, I think we are near getting to an announcement where we will be able to say what direction we're going in, and because we have had\u2014. Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon. And finally from me\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm sorry I can't say too much about that because we haven't actually\u2014. And if that's as far as you're willing to go, then I'll stop asking. sian gwenllian am: I just want to understand a little about the pilot, the pathfinders in eight local authority areas. Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work? julie morgan am: The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. , actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes? sian gwenllian am: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014? jo-anne daniels: So, in 'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire\u2014and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven\u2014who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home. sian gwenllian am: So, would you say it's a child-centred approach? jo-anne daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded. lynne neagle am: And how long have they been going for? jo-anne daniels: So, those eight pathfinders started their work in\u2014I think it was\u2014February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years. julie morgan am: Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention. hefin david am: In your report, the 'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that 'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth? julie morgan am: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about \u00a381 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing\u00a0childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within 'Prosperity for All' and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. hefin david am: And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue? julie morgan am: Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and,for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales? julie morgan am: Right. , obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas. lynne neagle am: Before you move on, Janet, Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. sian gwenllian am: Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase? julie morgan am: I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. sian gwenllian am: Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day. julie morgan am: I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded. janet finch-saunders am: Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available? julie morgan am: Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so,in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that? janet finch-saunders am: I know that\u2014we've just had a useful briefing from\u00a0David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group? julie morgan am: It is demand\u2014 nicola edwards: [Inaudible.]\u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Yes, yes. nicola edwards: \u2014obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. julie morgan am: It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody. lynne neagle am: I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. julie morgan am: I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys M\u00f4n was nearly 90 per cent or something\u2014 sian gwenllian am: They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding. julie morgan am: In other areas, it's much, much lower\u2014in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that? julie morgan am: We are planning to extend it. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation\u00a0of that.\u00a0It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. janet finch-saunders am: Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured? julie morgan am: We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. janet finch-saunders am: And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales? julie morgan am: We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to\u2014 nicola edwards: Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage. suzy davies am: Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on? nicola edwards: You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way. lynne neagle am: Just before we move on, you said that 29 per cent of the take-up of the childcare offer is either through Welsh or is bilingual. Have you got any figures about how many children are accessing it in Welsh only? nicola edwards: We will have. With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. lynne neagle am: Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact? julie morgan am: Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information. dawn bowden am: So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future? julie morgan am: No, I'm not surprised at all. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody\u2014so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up. dawn bowden am: I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare. julie morgan am: Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to\u2014. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare. Before\u2014 lynne neagle am: Are you going to move on? Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand? julie morgan am: Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of \u00a350 million to \u00a355 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of \u00a340 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys M\u00f4n, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years\u2014 sian gwenllian am: So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. So, I'm not quite sure what 'on the cusp' of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what 'on the cusp of returning to work' is\u2014what that means from your perspective\u2014and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion? julie morgan am: Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments\u2014that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the\u2014 dawn bowden am: Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well. julie morgan am: Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said\u2014the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education\u2014and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies\u2014who are\u2014the letters may have come in from some of your constituents\u2014not able to access the offer as things stand. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on 'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently\u2014those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on. dawn bowden am: So, what are the\u2014? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at? julie morgan am: Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression 'on the cusp of work' we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate\u2014 dawn bowden am: Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly\u2014 julie morgan am: No, this review will report early next year. My final question\u2014 lynne neagle am: Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries.",
        " suzy davies am: Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work? julie morgan am: Have you got some information on that? nicola edwards: The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think 'secured' is probably a slightly premature phrase. suzy davies am: Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years. julie morgan am: As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials. julie morgan am: It's all in the process\u2014 lynne neagle am: And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously. sian gwenllian am: How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents? julie morgan am: We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean. sian gwenllian am: Do we know how many children we're talking about? nicola edwards: Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings. nicola edwards: It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work. lynne neagle am: One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference? julie morgan am: We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. dawn bowden am: Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that? julie morgan am: Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of \u00a35.6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of\u2014 julie morgan am: Well, we don't know what's happening with that\u2014 dawn bowden am: \u2014what would happen beyond that. julie morgan am: \u2014funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite. sian gwenllian am: As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money\u2014\u00a31 million, I understand\u2014has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC? julie morgan am:  sian gwenllian am: Yes. sian gwenllian am: Yes, but for your transparency around your particular\u00a0view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was\u2014 julie morgan am: It would have restricted us a lot. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail\u2014going through HMRC would put limits on that. julie morgan am: That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it. sian gwenllian am: But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties\u2014 julie morgan am: One of the major reasons, I think\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Okay. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards. julie morgan am: Do you want to add something to this? nicola edwards: So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called 'special characters' in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. sian gwenllian am: Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there\u2014 nicola edwards: Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was\u2014. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that. julie morgan am: If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. , there are other things with using HMRC\u2014if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. jo-anne daniels: The only thing I'd add is that\u2014and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this\u2014the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that\u2014that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here. sian gwenllian am: Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option\u2014and this is only going back a few months\u2014because it will remove\u2014and this is quoting them\u2014 'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'\u2014 blah, blah, blah, blah.\u00a0So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know\u2014. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence\u2014we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now. julie morgan am: I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases\u2014I certainly have\u2014where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. And thanks to the HMRC, because we've had nothing but a very positive relationship with them. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this? jo-anne daniels: So, at the moment, local\u2014. jo-anne daniels: So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation.\u00a0Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. suzy davies am: Could you give us an idea of the price tag? jo-anne daniels: At the moment, it's about \u00a32.5 million. jo-anne daniels: So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC. suzy davies am: Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures. sian gwenllian am: If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer? jo-anne daniels: So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of\u2014 sian gwenllian am: But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things? nicola edwards: They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that. Si\u00e2n, do you want to ask about the Welsh language? sian gwenllian am: I think we've\u2014. lynne neagle am: Really\u2014? sian gwenllian am: I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened. lynne neagle am: Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem. There's a difference between a bilingual service in the context of what HMRC understood that to be, in the context of their scheme, and the very detail of the standards when they got into their IT systems. lynne neagle am: Shouldn't that have been something that was worked out at the beginning? nicola edwards: Possibly, but they did need to do quite detailed work, not just into their own IT systems, but the feed-in systems from the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Post Office as well, to understand the full complexity of how the standards would comply across all of that. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers' standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with. lynne neagle am: I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please? julie morgan am: Would we have any idea? nicola edwards: We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment? julie morgan am: I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely. suzy davies am: Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area. julie morgan am: So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting\u2014 julie morgan am: I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that: 'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government\u2019s work on the Early Years system.' That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering? julie morgan am: At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension\u2014 suzy davies am: With limits, yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. suzy davies am: I accept what you say about the current system\u2014 julie morgan am: I believe it's much more\u2014. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that\u2014unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children\u2014on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment? julie morgan am: Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five\u2014that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas? julie morgan am: I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas\u2014I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that\u2014? Do you know the actual percentage? suzy davies am: It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but\u2014 jo-anne daniels: So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty.FootnoteLink suzy davies am: Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is\u2014basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it? jo-anne daniels: Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second\u2014oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course\u2014in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can\u2019t prove it? jo-anne daniels: We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we\u2019ve been working with the SAIL\u2014secure anonymised information linkage\u2014and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children\u2019s progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions. suzy davies am: We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage? julie morgan am: Just in terms of what we\u2019re thinking of doing with Flying Start\u2014. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we\u2019re looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities\u2014we talked about that earlier\u2014so, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. We do want to make it available to more children, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with\u2014 suzy davies am: No, no\u2014we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected? julie morgan am: Do we know why? jo-anne daniels: So, the approach that we\u2019ve taken to evaluation in Flying Start\u2014. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you\u2019re familiar with the work that, as I say, we\u2019ve been doing with SAIL. We\u2019re currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child\u2019s chances have improved primarily because they\u2019re getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There\u2019s got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky\u2014in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so\u2014 suzy davies am: And that's why we need to know who is. jo-anne daniels: Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do. Just on the final point from me\u2014yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition\u2014taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion,\u00a0for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire? julie morgan am: I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year\u2014 suzy davies am: So, what have they told you? julie morgan am: \u2014and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop. suzy davies am: Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to\u2014well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that\u2014 julie morgan am: Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. suzy davies am: Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago. julie morgan am: In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries\u2014it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided? lynne neagle am: If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course\u2014we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really. julie morgan am: Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up\u2014 suzy davies am: Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment. jo-anne daniels: Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting\u2014again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

        "phd a: Why is it so cold in here ? professor b: so , we haven't sent around the agenda . So , i  , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? postdoc g: I c I could talk about the meeting .  phd a: Well , I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed , but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker . professor b: OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now . You were gonna starting to say something ? postdoc g: Well , you you , already know about the meeting that 's coming up and I don't know if if this is appropriate for this . phd e: What meeting ? professor b: We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week postdoc g: OK . professor b: I think phd e: Who 's coming ? professor b: John Fiscus postdoc g: An - anything else , strike anybody ? phd a: we started running recognition on one conversation but it 's the r isn't working yet . phd e: Wha phd a: the main thing would be if anyone has , knowledge about ways to , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition , that would be helpful to know about . professor b: Yeah , so ,  phd e: What about , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? phd c: Yeah , we 're working more on it but , it 's not finished . postdoc g: I had thought under my topic that I would mention the , four items that I I , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting , which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans . professor b: Alright , why don't we start off with this , u u I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . So the one issue was that the the , lapel mike , isn't as good as you would like . Right ? phd a: Ri -  , professor b: Is that is that basically the point ? phd a: yeah , the And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,  or and even on prosody , which Don is gonna be working on soon , it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . phd a: So And I also talked to Mari this morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that . And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too . Right , so one th grad h: Well , so professor b: well one thing I was gonna say was that , i we could get more , of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of radio channels we have because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order . grad h: So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . grad h: And then just sort of about , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth . phd a: But we have more than one type of professor b: How am I d phd a: for instance , you 're phd c: Yeah . phd a: But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , as much as possible that would be really helpful . professor b: Well ,  it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , phd d: Yeah . professor b: so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of if this microphone seems OK to people , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . grad h: Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , some of the Jimlets aren't working . grad h: And so , w  , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working . phd e: Can we get these , wireless ? grad h: So professor b: No , but my point is phd a: But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting . professor b: R r right grad h: I I 'm not sure I 'm follow . Say that again ? professor b: Right now , we 've got , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard . professor b: Also what we 've talked before about getting another , radio , grad h: Right . professor b: So ,  so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do , but have them all be the same mike . I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , more uniformity , phd a: Right . phd a: Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n  , professor b: Yeah . phd e: Is it because You you 're saying the for dialogue purposes , so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? Is that what you mean ? phd a: Well Jane would know more about the transcribers . postdoc g: a couple times , so , yeah , the transcribers notice And in fact there 're some where ,  ugh well ,  there 's it 's the double thing . postdoc g: And he 's always they always they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's Adam 's channel is .  , \" Baaah ! \" phd a: Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w postdoc g: Yeah , but  it 's not just that , it 's also you know you professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: It 's also like n no breathing , no You know , it 's like it 's it 's  , professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view grad h: Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . professor b: When we 're doing grad h: Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . professor b: Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about and that grad h: Yep . postdoc g: And there was some talk about , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to grad h: Yep . So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible . grad h: And , you know , we 're researchers , so we all have big heads . OK , so , Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I 've spoken with , u u a lot of people here , not everyone .  , and , he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in , seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans , which I 'll mention in a second , and also , he was interested in the pre - segmentation and then he 's also interested in the transcription conventions . postdoc g: And ,  So , it seems to me in terms of like , i i it wou You know , OK . So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room and how it how the recordings are done , and that kind of thing . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , handle multi - channel recording . grad h: Oh , I should 've I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . I I , @ @ didn't didn't see it , yesterday but I 'm going to see it today . And , that 's that will enable us to do nice  , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments . In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that that continues to be , a terrific asset to the to the transcribers . What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , there 's some speech in . I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies ,  normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels . phd c: And so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's there 's speech in addition to to the thing we we did now which is just , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . So I 'm I 'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file postdoc g: This is good . phd c: but I 'm I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in in different channels . postdoc g: Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID potentially . professor b: something I guess I didn't put in the list but , on that , same day later on in or maybe it 's No , actually it 's this week , Dave Gelbart and I will be , visiting with John Canny who i you know , is a CS professor , postdoc g: Oh . You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things phd e: That would be cool . professor b: or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want phd d: Yeah . professor b: but they might wanna just , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them  , I also had a discussion So , w  , we 'll be over over there talking with him , after class on Friday . I had a , discussion today with , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , a German , scientist who 's got a fair sized group doing a range of things . But but , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , head models and microphone things . And so , he 's he and possibly a student , there w there 's , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , may come here , in the fall for , sort of a five month , sabbatical . phd e: That that reminds me , I had a a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here , either using , you know , the the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes , phd d:   phd e: and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , professor b: Right . phd e: And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who professor b: A little bit , phd e: and professor b: he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of phd d: Yeah , yeah . professor b: e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side , grad h:   professor b: if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a phd d: Yeah . professor b: if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . And if if someone 's talking on on on , one side or the other , it goes the other way . professor b: And then , it it it even looks different if th t if the two two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle . Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that  , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than your guys 's mikes . phd e: So if you just looked at grad h: Oh , that 's another cl cue , phd d: Yeah . phd e: yeah , looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . professor b: Yeah , well you have to the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and and and are probably the key . phd a: You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting . postdoc g: Can I ask one thing ?  , so , Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , microphone arrays . postdoc g: is there  b And I also want to say , his he can't stay all day . He needs to  , leave for  , from here to make a two forty - five flight grad h: Oh , so just morning . postdoc g: So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that ,  that , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . professor b: Probably not but I I 'll I 'll I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved . professor b: he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , or he might have no interest whatsoever . grad h: Is he involved in Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project . NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software . Is is he the one working on that ? professor b: Well that 's what they 're starting up . professor b: well I think they 've instrumented a room but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet . They don't have the phd e: Are they going to do video as well ? grad h:  . grad h: Oh , cuz what what I had read was , they had a  very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . professor b: All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . professor b: And one one notable difference u u actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not , but one one , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes . The reason I didn't go for that here was because , the focus , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was  , in impromptu situations . And we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it . professor b: And so , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , one or more other people i  , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be . And therefore it would not it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just phd e: So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? professor b: No . So there 's there 's  , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this . professor b: So , the ,  the big arrays , places , like  , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places , they have , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . professor b: And it 's and , in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff , but it d it d we ended up not doing it . grad h: And then they have little ones too professor b: And then they had the little ones , yeah . grad h: but  but they don't have our block of wood , right ? professor b: Yeah , our block of wood is unique . professor b: But the But the No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something phd a:   professor b: and and ,  So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . professor b: so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do .  , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask . Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask \"  , are you recording video ? \" phd a: Right , professor b: right ? phd a: right . professor b: And and the acoustic people will always say , \" well are you doing , array microphones ? \" So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .  , I know that having an array of  , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones . But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off  , channels when you 're later on ?  , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ? grad h: It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . professor b: Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the postdoc g: OK . professor b: But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction . grad h: That 's right ,  if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it , phd a: Right . That would be fine , phd e: So to save that data you You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? grad h: Buy more disk space . professor b: But then , you know , there 's it there 's phd e: What you save , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah professor b: There 's I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . grad h: Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . professor b: Right ? phd a: it seems professor b: So phd e: Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . phd a: it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this , just getting the data , because there 's a number of sites like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , but they 'll be recording with video and they 'll be You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , and just have this other information available . So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure and then , I don't know , save it out or have whoever 's interested save that data out , transfer it there , it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . grad h: You mean to to actually get a microphone array and do that ? phd a: Well , if Even if we 're not grad h: And video and phd a: I 'm not sure about video . That 's sort of an video has a little different nature since right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .  , but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then grad h: Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . professor b: See the problem is it it took , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes . And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily and , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort . professor b: But , e I think for  , how we 're gonna decide For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .  , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes .",
        " phd a: Well if there 's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these f those professor b: Yeah . phd a: So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data , who 's interested , and even if ICSI it itself isn't .  , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ? I don't know . phd a:  it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of grad h: And y it 'd certainly gets skew . phd a: once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data . I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , grad h: Just professor b: but the real issue is that , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . professor b: which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , phd a: I see . But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours which might be useful for for them . phd a: Right ,  at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts , professor b: And then we can offer up the room , phd a: and Right . professor b: Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . phd a: But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two , professor b: Well I thi phd a: so professor b: yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do . phd e: Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ?  professor b: Right , so we have we phd e:  grad h: Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , that you have an infrastructure problem , you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it . Internally , but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video . So it 's just postdoc g: Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video . There 's the fact that then  , if i I I 've heard comments about this before , \" why don't you just put on a video camera ? \" But you know , it 's sort of like saying , \"  , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things , but , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . \"  , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in . professor b: So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . postdoc g: I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ? grad h: Oh ! Probably not . postdoc g: A permission form ? grad h: Has Don have you s did you si I thought you did actually . grad h: Didn't you read a digit string ? phd e: You were here at a meeting before . postdoc g: Did you sign a form ? grad f: Did I ? I don't know . professor b: Yeah , we we postdoc g: But I just grad f: Can I verbally consent ? postdoc g: you know . You 're on recor you 're being recorded postdoc g: o grad f: Yeah . phd a: and professor b: we don't we don't perform electro - shock during these meetings , grad f: I don't care . phd e: How big is the data set ? postdoc g: Oh , it 's what  is one meeting . I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of of when to stop transcribing this one or So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose , and and and so phd e:  - huh . postdoc g: And , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases . So , you know , that means you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on  , right now all eight of them have differe  , additional data sets . postdoc g: And , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the ,  the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . But , just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .  , these still , when they 're finished , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . OK , now I wanted to mention the , teleconference I had with , Jonathan Fiscus . postdoc g: He , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been , looking , spending a lot of time with I 'm not quite sure the connection , but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system . But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach . postdoc g: So what he wants me to do and what we what we will do and  , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System . And they do have some sort of software , at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS and that he wants to experiment with taking our data and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . I I I explained to him in in detail the , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript . And , you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately and and the focus on reliability . He 's he 's very  , independently he asked , \" well what about reliability ? \" So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing . OK ,  phd a: Sorry , can you explain what the ATLAS I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system . postdoc g: Well , you know , at this point I think  , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this . But , there there is a way of viewing  , whenever you have coding categories , and you 're dealing with  , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , choices that you could use for each each of them . grad h: Is is Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ? I don't remember the acronym . The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . grad h: And that 's basically what I based the format that I did I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . phd e: Is this the project that 's sort of , between , NIST and and , a couple of other places ? postdoc g:   And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this , this , tree structure , annotated tree diagram thing . postdoc g: So ,  and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all . And , \" oh , and how 'd you handle this ? \" And I said , \" well , you know , this way \" and And and we had a really nice conversation .  , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury . I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , transcription . And what he said was that , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information . And , that 's ,  You know , I need to get back to him and and , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific , phd a:  . phd e: The p the people postdoc g: but I just haven't had time yet . phd e: The the folks that they 're , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters postdoc g: Sorry , what ? Yes . phd e: or postdoc g: Apparently Well , I get the sense they 're kind of like that . Like it 's like a pool of of somewhat  , secretarial I don't think that they 're court reporters . Like medical transcriptionist type people grad h: Nu - it 's mostly it 's for their speech recognition products , phd e: But aren't they 're postdoc g: Yep . grad h: Well they they do send it out but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . grad h: So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . postdoc g: Up to now it 's been monologues , as far my understood . postdoc g: Brian himself downloaded So So , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded  , cuz , you know , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do . postdoc g: And then what he 's going to do is check it , a before they go be beyond the first one . professor b: So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go phd e: OK . grad h: Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them . phd e: Well if you 're tran if you got that channel right there postdoc g: d  , in my case phd c: Yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah . phd a: I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files . phd a: there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . phd e: Yeah , that 's phd a: it sort of depends where you are in postdoc g: And especially since a lot of these phd d: Yeah . grad h: And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways . postdoc g: Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly grad h: So . postdoc g: unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix . In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel , grad h: Right . postdoc g: Yeah , well phd a: Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ? grad h: Right . phd a: In other words , if postdoc g: Well , I have to ask him . postdoc g: But but the ,  I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people , and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of So , you know , one of these people was was transcribing the , networks group talk and she said , \" I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , \" \" but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the that 's the convention and I just \" Cuz you know , if you don't know grad h: Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that . grad h: The networks group meetings are all phd e: Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? Why not just do it all ourselves ? professor b: it 's historical .  , some point ago we thought that  , it \" boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that \" , phd c:  - huh . phd d: No , just professor b: you know , like we just did , and , here 's , a a , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . professor b: And it still might be a good thing phd e: I 'm just wondering now phd a: Actu yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of professor b: but phd e: Well , I 'm I 'm wondering now if it 's grad h: Well we can talk about more details later . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , you know , have some more discussions with them . It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . grad h: So , Liz , with with the SRI recognizer , can it make use of some time marks ? phd a: OK , so this is a , grad h: I I guess I don't know what that means . phd a: and actually I should say this is what Don has b  , he 's already been really helpful in , chopping up these So so first of all you  , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .  , but second of all ,  in general because some of these channels , I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are have a lot of cross - ta sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .  , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition , especially forced alignment . So , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed which we did have some problems with , and Thilo , I think told me why this was , but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning , so the SRI re phd c: No , th Yeah . They they were not switching them but what they were they were adjusting them , phd a: and they They were not phd c: so . phd a: So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments . phd a: So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , cuts that you made on the mixed signal . Right ? phd a: the problem is if we have no time marks , then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . And so grad h: Oh , I see , phd a: if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , you know , par paragraph of of talk , grad h: it 's for the length . phd a: And , I think with phd e: Well you would need to like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , right ? phd a: No , we used the fact that So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this , whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , grad h: It 's already chunked . And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . That 's great , cuz the recognizer can grad h: it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also . phd a: Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think . phd a: Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to . phd e: Why not do a a a forced alignment ? grad h: That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . phd a: If you do a forced alignment on something really grad h: Got  six sixty minutes of phd a: well even if you do it on something really long you need to know you can always chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , chop . postdoc g: Now wasn't I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment , phd a: So postdoc g: after they grad h: Yeah , but professor b: I I think that they are , grad h: We 'll have to talk to Brian . professor b: yeah , I 'm sure they will and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it . professor b: it sounds like Liz has some concerns phd a: Maybe they have some you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers professor b: and phd a: I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . postdoc g: I just you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing . But the it is true that the segments I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you but the segments that in your first meeting are great . phd a: Right , cuz postdoc g: Well , I I was thinking it would be fun to to  , if if you wouldn't mind , to give us a pre - segmentation . postdoc g: maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that  , the first transcribed meeting , the one that I transcribed . phd c: I 'm sure I have some postdoc g: Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ? grad h: February sixteenth I think . phd c: but but that 's the one where we 're , trai training on , so that 's a little bit grad h: Oh . phd c: It 's a little bit at odd to postdoc g: Oh , darn . phd a: And actually as you get transcripts just , for new meetings , we can try postdoc g:  - huh . So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of  , parameters f on the recognizer , postdoc g:   phd a: The first meeting had I think just four people , phd c: Four speakers , yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you . I guess the other thing , I I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , I know you and I talked about this a little bit , there was an issue of , suppose we get in the , I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , where we we , we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were we 're the we 're still a bit slow on feeding at that point we 've caught up and the the the , the weak link is is recording meetings . OK , two questions come , is you know what how how do we  , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? And the other one is , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? So , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was grad h: We had spoken with them about it . postdoc g: And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , Dave finishes the and maybe it 's already finished the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .  , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . It 's just a matter of , you know , providing So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the  , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment . professor b: One one was  , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings , postdoc g: Yeah . The types of overlaps professor b: types of overlaps , and so forth that that someone could do . And the third one is is , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have which is that , if ,  if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . For instance , marking in some overlapping potentially overlapping fashion , the value of , ar articulatory features . professor b: You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth .",
        "  , as opposed to doing phonetic  , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , grad h:  professor b: and , assuming , articulatory feature values for those those things . postdoc g: Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels , wouldn't it ?  , I would think that that , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . professor b: but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone postdoc g:   grad h: Yeah , but but just saying what the professor b: because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here postdoc g: Yeah , I 'm sure . professor b: and and and it 's so I phd e: You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom - up . Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , phd e:   professor b: and  , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to postdoc g: That 's nice . professor b: some sort of categories but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just \" click , you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound \" and so on . phd a: So this is like gestural  , these g professor b: Yeah , something like that . professor b: actually if we get into that it might be good to , haul John Ohala into this phd a: Right . phd a: But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data , postdoc g: Excellent . phd a: like so that you can do far field studies of those gestures or  , or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ? Or ? professor b: No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally . And then you have i and then and then it 's natural in all senses , phd e: Just a source of data ? phd a: I see . professor b: in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know , one might have , and you have the close mikes , and you have people talking naturally . And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , phd a:  - huh . professor b: right ? So so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , phd d: Yeah . professor b: if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus  , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , censored choices , we don't have the video , we don't and so forth , but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . professor b: And , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . professor b: people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT and ,  w due to its markings , and then the Switchboard transcription thing , well I think has been very useful for a lot of people . professor b: So phd a: I guess I wanted to , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings . phd a: I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , \" well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow professor b: Yeah . Go to their meeting tomorrow and see if we can try , to convince them postdoc g:   professor b: Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , phd a: because they have And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here professor b: right ? postdoc g:    phd e: You mean in terms of the topic topics ? phd a: Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things and , just dialogue - wise , professor b:   And then the other thing is , I don't know if this is at all useful , but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch , professor b: Yes . grad h: You mean non - ICSI ? phd a: non - ICSI , non - academic , grad h: Yeah , I guess you you can try phd a: you know , like government people , grad h: but phd a: I don't know .  , it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches grad h: Well , tha I think that 's her point . phd a: Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings postdoc g: Yeah . phd e: Does does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? postdoc g:   grad h: And I think , if we could get phd a: So I actually wrote to him and he answered , \" great , that sounds really interesting \" . grad h: But , it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording phd a: So grad h: so u I didn't have to do it each time . phd a: and I was thinking professor b: He - he 's supposed he 's supposed to be trained to do it .  , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging , grad h: It 's not that hard . phd a: disfluency tagging , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling . So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , \" well \" , and that \" well \" is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .  , and things like that , th postdoc g: Of course some of that can be li done lexically . phd a: A lot of it can be done postdoc g: And I also they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already . phd a: I think there 's a second pass and I don't really know what would exist in it . But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not , postdoc g:   postdoc g: I wanted to whi while we 're  , so , to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data ,  I have two questions . One of them is , Jerry Feldman 's group , they they , are they I know that they recorded one meeting . professor b: I think there 's we should go beyond , ICSI but , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group but even there he hadn't What he 'd said \" no \" to was for the main meeting . phd e: Well , and and the other thing too is when they originally said \" no \" they didn't know about this post - editing capability thing . professor b: there 's there 's , the networks group , I don't Do they still meeting regularly or ? grad h: Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not but they are no longer recording . professor b: But  , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore or ? grad h: ugh , what was his name ? professor b: i i postdoc g: Joe Sokol ? grad h: Yeah . professor b: OK , so they 're down to three or four people grad h: They and they stopped Yeah . postdoc g: We might be able to get the administration grad h: Well he was sort of my contact , so I just need to find out who 's running it now . phd a: Yeah , it One thing that would be nice postdoc g: I don't know phd a: and this it sounds bizarre but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion , like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that . Some group , \" yes , we must \" grad h: Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? phd a: Well , you know , something phd c: Yeah . grad f: Yeah , I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to phd a:  professor b: Yeah , with with with potential use from the defense department . phd a: No , but maybe stu student , groups or , film - makers , or som Something a little bit colorful . Yeah , th there 's a problem there in terms of , the  commercial value of of st  , postdoc g: Yeah , of course there is this problem though , that if we give them the chance to excise later we e might end up with like five minutes out of a f of m one hour phd d: Film - maker . phd a: And I don't mean that they 're angry phd d: Is postdoc g: of Yes . phd a: but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat . So if anyone has ideas , I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing . postdoc g: Well there was this K P F A grad h: No that 's postdoc g: but OK . phd a: Or postdoc g: And I had one other one other aspect of this which is , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar  y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers . phd e: Did he mean ,  did he mean and non - British ? grad h: Well phd c: The all native . phd e: He said British was OK ? postdoc g: But but Sure , sure , sure . professor b: Why ? grad h: British is English ? phd c:  postdoc g: Yeah . professor b: Well , I don't I don't I don't think if he didn't say that postdoc g: Native speaking . grad h: So , why would he care ? phd e: Knowing the application phd a: That 's professor b: I remember wh I I remember a study phd a: I was thinking , knowing the , n National Institute of Standards , it is all professor b: I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on this was in Wall Street Journal days or something , they trained on American English and then they tested on , different native speakers from different areas . professor b: it was Swiss w Yeah , so it 's so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want ,  American English , postdoc g: All America , OK . It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of postdoc g: I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way , aren't they ?  , I sort of feel like they have professor b: I think so , grad h: Maybe . grad h: And maybe there are a few of with us where it was professor b: Yeah . grad h: you know , Dan wasn't there and before Jose started coming , professor b: Yeah . professor b: So , what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? phd d: Yeah . phd a: Exactly , that 's what I was professor b: You 'd think like they would be phd d: A film - maker . phd a: something where there there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing . phd a: Yeah , we could phd e: A any department that calls itself science phd d: Department . phd d: Computer sci grad h: That postdoc g: We could get Julia Child . phd a: I 'm I 'm actually serious grad h: That 's phd a: because , you know , we have the set up here grad h: Got a ticket . grad f: I know grad h: I could phd a: Not not professor b: Put a little ad up saying , \" come here and argue \" . grad h: and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . grad h: But when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff , so . phd a: Or people who are really h professor b: They could have a discussion about te grad f: I grad h: We should probably bleep that out . grad f: I heard that at Cal Tech they have a special room someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out that you can go to and like throw things and break things . professor b: Yeah , now that is not actually what we grad f: So we can like post a grad h: Th - that 's not what we want . grad f: No , not to that extent phd a: Well , far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall . professor b: Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . postdoc g: It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the grad h: There was a dorm room at Tech that , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , the floor with mattresses . professor b: What did we mean by that ? Remember @ @ ? grad h: Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . phd a: Well I think that that was just sort of I I already asked Thilo professor b: Oh , you already did that . phd a: but that , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , people who are doing any kind of post - processing , whether it 's to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition .  , so , i is that Who else is work I guess Dan Ellis and you phd c: Dan , yeah . professor b: he 's he 's interested in in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . professor b: Which  grad h: I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes , professor b:  ? grad h: but who knows ? professor b: Well , let 's w i isn't that what what you want phd a: I don't know . I 'm bad professor b: t No , so No , i w wha what you what you want when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . professor b: And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by ,  by any room acoustics or is it just  , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? phd a: It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear professor b:  phd a: but I 'm not an expert . grad h: e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , room acoustic phd a: That that may be true . phd a: But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods grad h: Yeah . grad h: So I I think it 's just , phd a: Oh , I don't know . phd a: All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , techniques . phd e: So the problem is like , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people and that 's causing problems ? phd a: R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K because the t no one transcribed any words there and we throw it out . phd a: But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time , so you get some speech and then a \"  -  \" , and some more speech , so that whole thing is one chunk . And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , that 's where it 's a big problem . postdoc g: You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well , the encoding of the phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: And and he also , he was phd a: The energy , phd d: Yeah , phd a: right . postdoc g: I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events . Because , eh , it 's possible , eh , eh , in a simp sample view , to , nnn , to compare with c with the segment , the the kind of assessment what happened with the the different parameters . And only with a different bands of color for the , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ . phd d: I I I see that , eh , you are considering now , eh , a very sophisticated , eh , ehm , eh , @ @ set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si symbols to to transcribe . No ? Because , before , you you are talking about the the possibility to include in the Transcriber program eh , a set of symbols , of graphic symbol to t to mark the different situations during the transcription postdoc g: Oh , I w  - huh . No ? postdoc g: Well , you 're saying So , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and and and slam the door and stuff ? phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: Or some other kind of thing ? phd d: No ? To to mark postdoc g: Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much . The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c  , time things . postdoc g: But I I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you phd a:  . postdoc g: which is that it sounded to me , Liz , as though you and , maybe I didn't q understand this , but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together . postdoc g: And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker , phd a:   postdoc g: and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer . Is that right ? phd a: Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , postdoc g:   phd a: because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . phd a: And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .  , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio , postdoc g:   phd a: which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel , or to have very to have closer , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech that gets transcribed in it , or both . So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good . And then the issue of like global processing of some signal and then , you know , before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that . You can ,   The problem is just that the acoustic when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , you you 'll get , a  an alignment with the wrong duration pattern or it phd e: Oh , so that 's the problem , is the the signal - to - noise ratio . It 's not the fact that you have like  , what he did is allow you to have , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations . phd a: Right , things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong phd e:   It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word . So , yeah , bottom bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , detecting energies , phd d: Yeah . professor b: O K ,  tea has started out there I suggest we c run through our digits and , postdoc g: OK "

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

So I didn't did you get a chance to look at all yet ? grad d: Yeah , I looked at some of that stuff . OK so let 's start with the  belief - nets , the general influence stuff and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff . grad e: Well I think one could go there 's I think we can di discuss everything . First of all this I added , I knew from sort of basically this has to be there right ?  professor b: Oh are you gonna go there or not ? Yeah , so one i grad e: Given given   not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just professor b: Right , true . And I 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that grad e: And  ? So Go - there in the first place or not is definitely  one of the basic ones .  Is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get professor b: Well grad d: Which one ? grad e: what ? grad a: \" Go there \" . professor b: so there is this question about grad e: Here we we actually get just probabilities , professor b: Yeah . professor b: the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know  current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all , grad e:   professor b: right ? And so that a decision would be do we want that so you could two different things you could do , you could have all those values for Go - there or you could have Go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . grad e:  ? grad a:  it seems that you could   it seems that those things would be logically independent like you would wanna have them separate or binary , Go - there and then the the possibilities of how to go there because professor b: OK , that 's let 's start that way . grad a: because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . And so I 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? Everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - A . But when it comes to sort of writing down when you when you do these things is it here ? You sort of have to a write the values this can take . grad e: And here I was really  in some s sometimes I was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because  this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones  for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? So maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . professor b: No  grad e: How can I write here that this is something , a number that cr keeps on changing ? But OK . professor b: You 've s have you seen this before at all Keith , these belief - net things ? grad a: no , but I think I 'm following it . grad e: So here is the the we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions . grad d: Is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? OK , h well  how is it different from user finance ? grad e:  the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he is he cheap , average , or spendy ? grad d: Alright . grad e: And  I didn't come  maybe a user I don't know , I didn't want to write greediness , but grad a: Yeah . So Keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff . professor b: So this is not just a display , this is actually a GUI to a simulator that will if we tell it all the right things we 'll wind up with a functioning belief - net at the other end . grad e: OK , so here was OK , I can think of  people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have a a finer scale moderately cheap , professor b: Doesn't matter . grad d: Well ,  you 've written in you 've written in what  seems to be required like what else is is do you want ? grad e: If that 's permissible then I 'm happy . So here 's here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the  the value of that is gonna have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? It 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net . And if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things . grad e: OK , and so this , oh that grad d: The other thing is that  every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? professor b: Yeah , that 's a good question . grad d:  Well , in Srini 's thing there was this thing there was this  option like proper inferences which suggests that  doesn't happen , automatically . Yeah someone has to track that down , but I but  And and and I think actually  grad e: I just accidentally Oops . professor b: one of the we w items for the  user home base  should be  essentially non - local . I they 're only there for the day and they don't have a place that they 're staying . grad d: Well grad e: Oh just  accidentally erased this , I I just had values here such as   is he s we had in our list we had \" Is he staying in our hotel ? \" , \" Is he staying with friends ? \" , and so forth professor b: Yeah . So my suggestion is we just pick  grad e: Something down here ? professor b: one , you know one  particular one of the  well let 's do the first first one let 's do the one that we sort of already think we did so w that was the of the endpoint ? grad e:   grad d: Is  grad e: Ah , grad d: So it 's true or false ? professor b: No , that 's that 's a grad e: OK . grad c: What 's the difference between mode and endpoint ? grad d: I thought mode , yeah . professor b: although that grad e:  mode was  professor b: Well , that 's grad d: Mode of transportation ? grad e: Yeah . professor b: No , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true . grad e: climb , emerge professor b: No no no , these are ju that 's just a point , grad c:  grad d: Well some of those are subsumed by approach . professor b: this is ju grad c: Would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it ? grad a: The Charles Bridge , you know . You know , you y you go first go the town square grad c: Well I eh grad a: No , if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge and doesn't really matter which way you cross which where you end up at the end but the part the good part is walking over it , so . Anyway so let 's just leave it three with three for now grad e:  -  , mmm . professor b: and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started . grad e: OK , we professor b: You 'll see it you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason I wanna do this . grad e: w well the  user was  definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local professor b: Right . grad e: more likely to view if he 's a tourist  and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross  professor b: We did , but the three things w that that it contributed to this in fact , the other two aren't up there . so one was the ontology grad e: We 'll d what type of building is it ? professor b: Yeah . professor b: OK , so this is w Right , so what w I what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff grad a:  -  professor b: the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes  which were the endpoint decision as seen from the  user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . So each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes  based on the th those three separate considerations grad a:  -  professor b: so if we wanted to do that would have to put in  three intermediate nodes grad e:  we can load it up it you know very simple . grad a: So professor b: and then what you and I have to talk about is , OK if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow  how do they get combined ? But the they 're they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about . grad e: So that 's w w in our  in in Johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . professor b: Oh , it was called mode , so this this is m mode here means the same as endpoint . professor b: OK , why don't we ch can we change that ? grad e: We can just rename that , yeah . You know , but that was actually , yeah unfortunately that was a  kind of an intermediate versio that 's I don't think what we would currently do . grad a: Can I ask about \" slurred \" and \" angry \" as inputs to this ? professor b: That 's a grad a: What why ? grad d: Like they 're either true or false grad e: The prosody ? grad a: OK . grad c: If the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know grad a:   grad d: Therefore grad c: And , you know , possibly  grad a: Less likely to enter . So so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . professor b: So let 's think about this this question of how do we wanna handle so there 're two separate things . One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing Bhaskara , is  can we arrange so that I think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in  from on ontology items . So the let 's take the case of the  this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business  is it something you physically could enter grad a:   So that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set , so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow . professor b: Now grad e: Seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these  things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something  professor b: Right . grad e: if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this , then it 's more likely to be entered . professor b: I  that 's I think that 's completely right and  I think that 's good , right ? So what what that says is that we might be able to  take and in particular so so the ones we talked about were  exhibiting and selling grad e: Accessibility . professor b: no , accessibility meant grad e: If it 's closed one probably won't enter . Or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it , professor b: OK . grad e: Yeah , all all of these if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things professor b: Right . is that you want an intermediate structure which i  is essentially the or of  for this purpose of of  selling , f fixing , or servicing . So that it  that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose  one of these places is quite like the other . Does that seem right ? So we di grad c: Basic you 're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ? professor b: if we Yes . professor b: So if well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three grad e: These three ? professor b: Yeah . grad d: What ex  and so either those is true f or false ? professor b:   well it it i here 's where it gets a little tricky . grad d: So professor b:  from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth . professor b: That that if any of those things is true then it 's the kind of place that you  grad e:  more likely to enter . grad d: So you just wanna have them all pointing to a summary thing ? professor b: You could , yeah . professor b: That 's the p part of the idea , is grad e:  is is that the object type node ? professor b: I d grad e: So are they the is it the kind of object that sells , fixes , or services things ? professor b: Well , o open up object type and let 's see what its values are . professor b: Oh , well OK first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ? grad e: Yeah . grad e: Yeah , I w I was just gonna commercial action inside where people p professor b: Well couldn't I do let 's do commercial  landmark and grad e: And where was the accessible , yeah . professor b: Well accessible I think is different cuz that 's tempor that that varies temporally , grad e: Yeah . grad c: What would a hotel fall under ? professor b: I would call that a service , but but I don't know . grad c: Well  in terms of entity type ? professor b: Say w w well it 's co I would s a a again for this purpose I think it 's commercial . grad d:  what does the underscore - T at the end of each of those things signify ? grad e:  things . grad a: So we 're deriving  this the this feature of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? Couldn't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? professor b: Well you could , that 's a that 's a choice . professor b: So  grad a:  it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else professor b: Yeah , the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision , grad a: and  . professor b: now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway , this i grad a: OK . professor b: at a mental level that 's what we we 're gonna have to sort out . professor b: So , you know what does this look like , what are what are  intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions grad a:   professor b: and what 's the best way to organize this so that  it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff . I 'm just thinking about how people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this and it would probably you wouldn't just sort of remember that they sell stuff and then deduce from that that it must be going on inside or something . grad e: Well I think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , grad a:   grad e: it 's not either or mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site . IE a a castle or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue grad a:    which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint . grad e: Could we just move it like this ? professor b: No no , I don't want the link there at all . professor b: Because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate thing which is  the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based o on the user models , so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions , so let 's make a new node grad e: Yeah . grad c: Just as a suggestion maybe you could \" save as \" to keep your old one nice and clean and so you can mess with this one . The old one was not that not that important , I think but grad c: OK , well , not a big deal then . grad c: Well the Isn't there a \" save as \" inside of java base ? grad e: But I can just take this grad c: OK . This was user something professor b: Well this was grad e: or professor b:  let 's p put it this let 's do endpoint underbar - U . grad e: end point ? professor b: i endpoint , e end poi this is sa grad e: Ah . professor b: let 's say underbar - U , so that 's the endpoint decision  as seen through the grad c: As related from the user model . So let 's let 's actually yeah so lin you can link that up to the grad e: Should I rename this too ? professor b:  yeah , so that , I guess that 's endpoint  grad e:  It 's underscore - E . Or ? Can I ? Where ? What ? professor b: Oh I d eh I don't know . grad c: I think you have to be in move mode before grad e:  - huh . And  maybe th maybe it 's just one who is the user , I don't know , maybe maybe there 's more . grad e: Well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now what was that people with Harry drove the car into the cafe professor b: Never mind . Now but the now so so but then the question is  so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse . grad e: Well let 's should we finish this , professor b: Sure , grad e:  but surely the user interests professor b: OK . grad e: yeah , yeah professor b: Well , maybe , I again , I d well , OK , put em in but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually  grad c: Well is grad e: Here this was one of my problems we have the user interest is a is a vector of five hundred values , so  That 's from the user model , grad d: Oh you mean level of interest ? grad e:  -  , no not levels of interest but things you can be interested in . grad d: Oh I see , grad e: Gothic churches versus Baroque townhouses versus grad d: right . So why is it oh it , so it 's like a vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ? grad e: Yea - n is that grad d: Like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not ? grad e: yeah  I I think grad d: I see . But the other thing you could do is have an and this will give you the flavor of the of what you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , I 'm sorry and the user . professor b: So you could have a k a \" fit \" node and again that would have to be computed by someone else grad e:   professor b: but  so that  grad e: Just as a mental note  professor b: Yeah , that 's all . And and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering ? professor b: Yeah . \" Do I have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the Koelner Dome or do I just have to \" \" time to take a picture of the outside ? \" grad e: Schedule ? professor b: Right . grad c: It seems like everything in a user model a affects professor b: Well that 's what we don't wanna do , see that se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that grad c: Yeah . professor b: an grad c: Cuz if the , and if the user is tired , the user state , grad d: Well grad c: right , it would affect stuff , but I can't see why e anything w everything in the model wouldn't be professor b: Well , but grad d: Right . professor b: Well , that that 's we can't do that , so we we 're gonna have to grad c: Yeah . professor b: but this is a good discussion , we 're gonna have to somehow figure out  some way to encapsulate that  so if there 's some general notion of for example the  relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the  compatibility with his current state , so that 's what you 'd have to do , you 'd have to get it down to something which  was itself relatively compact , so it could be compatibility with his current state which would include his money and his time and and his energy grad c: Yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . grad c: Yeah , but grad d: No but , it 's more than that , like the the more sort of you break it up like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore . That 's tha there 's one technical one grad c: Sh - sh yeah , professor b: and the other is it it gets used grad c: S so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? Subgrouping , basically into mo grad d: Yeah . But it there 's two advantages , one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential  CBT 's , grad e: Bhaskara ? professor b: the other is it can be it presumably can be used for multiple decisions . professor b: So that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u grad d: Right . professor b: not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it 's used in multiple places . professor b: OK , you 've got a signal , a d set of decisions  how do we do this ? grad e: What do I have under user state anyhow cuz I named that already something . grad c: I guess the the question  is It 's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again . professor b: Oh but the thing is that we   we had some things that  grad e: That don't . professor b: that don't grad e: The user interests and the user who who who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke grad c: Sure , but other I thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ? professor b: the right grad c: Seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something .  the that 's the the issue is  would Even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . And anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl  get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible .",
        " grad e: Maybe  if we look at the if we split it up again into sort of  if we look at the  the endpoint again we we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions so you can only enter a place if you are not too tired to do so and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions . professor b: W w but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it 's free cuz you grad e: And so is approaching .  are there are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like ,  never mind , not in the current professor b: No we have to enter the park .  So let me suggest we switch to another one ,  clearly there 's more work to be done on this grad e:   professor b: but I think it 's gonna be more instructive to to think about  other decisions that we need to make in path land . grad c: So you can save this one as and open up the old one , right and and then everything would be clean . professor b: Why , I think it 's worth saving this one but I think I 'd I 'd like to keep this one grad d: Yeah . professor b: cuz I wanna see if if we 're gonna reuse any of this stuff . grad e:  so this might be What next ? professor b: Well you tell me , so in terms of the  planner what 's what 's a good one to do ? grad e: Well let 's th this go there or not I think is a good one . So what makes things more likely that professor b: Well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse . grad e: So professor b: So Keith this is gonna get into your world because  we 're gonna want to know you know , which constructions indicate various of these properties grad a:   professor b: s and so I I don't yet know how to do this , I guess we 're gonna wind up pulling out  discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet . professor b: So that that the Go - there decision will have a node from  discourse , and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for grad e: We we also had discourse features of course for the endpoint . grad e: and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we don't have the discourse model here yet . professor b: Well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth .  This be specific for second year ?  And and we probably will have  something like a discourse for endpoint . grad e:  ? professor b: It 'll have the EVA values if if we have it . OK just for starters and here discourse  professor b: For Go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . grad e:  well , I think  we 're looking at the the little data that we have , so people say how do I get to the castle and this usually means they wanna go there . grad e: however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there . grad e: because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably professor b: Yeah , but that doesn't change the fact that you 're you want these two values . So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either yep , yay , A , or nay . OK ? professor b: And they 'll be a y  , a user Go - there and maybe that 's all , I don't know . grad d: Situation Go - there , because it 's whether it 's open or not . grad d:  the that interacts with the  EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed whereas if they want to  professor b: Right . grad d: so professor b: Right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be   essentially more interesting , so what  Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not grad a:   So yeah , that 's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish professor b: Well i i it can have di various values . grad d: Yeah , see I 'm I 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" Go - there \" is either gonna be true or false . grad a: Also , that node ,  the Go - there s S node would just be fed by separate ones for grad e:   grad a: you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the professor b: Could be . So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that  there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint  decision grad d: I guess the final professor b: maybe the t they 're final re and , I guess the very bottom endpoint decision  to the Go - there node . grad d: Maybe we could  have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go - there S node sort of fed into ? professor b: Could be , yeah . Well the Go - there , actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go - there S That 's right , grad d: Yeah , right . professor b: and again we 'll have to do layout at some point , but something like that .  really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops grad e: I was just gonna professor b:  grad d: Yes . grad e: How long does it take you to to compute  professor b: No it 's much worse than that . It if i loo it it it it it 's not def i it 's not well defined if you 're there are loops , grad d: It things don't converge , yeah . grad e:  R recursive action ? professor b: you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't  OK . grad e:  but this isn't , this is this line is just coming from over here . professor b: Yeah , no it 's not a loop yet , I 'm just saying we we , in no , in grad d: Yeah .  what 's what 's another decision you like ? grad e: OK , these have no parents yet , but I guess that sort of doesn't matter . Right ? professor b: Well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the  the discourse is is a mystery . grad a:  actually professor b: And then also the discourse endpoint , I I guess endpoint sub - D is if you wanna make it consistent . grad a:  actually is this the the right way to have it where  go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of don't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because isn't the ,  professor b: I think so . But that still allows for the possibility of the of the user model affecting our decision about whether a strike is the sort of thing which is going to keep this user away from professor b: Maybe not , a Right . grad a: But  OK I was just thinking I guess maybe I 'm conflating that user node with possible possible asking of the user professor b: Yeah . grad a: you know hey there 's a strike on ,  does that affect whether or not you wanna go or something professor b: Ah . Good point , I don't I don't know how we 're going to t  grad a: or Yeah , so that might not come out of a user model but , you know , directly out of interaction . professor b:  My current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it . professor b: And the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things grad a: OK . professor b: you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wanna go ? grad a: Yeah . professor b: But  if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wanna go ? grad a:   professor b: Alright , but let me let let 's stay with this a minute grad e: But professor b: because I want to do a little bit of organization . The organization is going to be that  the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that  as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed Keith is going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use grad a:   professor b: and Johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard , grad a: Alright . professor b: so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , OK  they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . I j wa I I assume everybody knows that , I just wanna you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , grad a:   professor b: so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes . And now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it isn't by any means  necessarily a simple thing that you want out . So  if there is an and there is mode of transportation grad e: And it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utterance go giving us professor b: Yeah . professor b: Yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide  how much of th where that goes .  it could be those are two separate things , it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates em as which would be my guess that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and stuff like that  you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say I wanna go back there , grad a:   professor b: wow , what does that mean and  grad e:  -  grad a: Now . So grad e: But is th is this picture that 's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - E , sub - D , sub - U and maybe a sub - O \" O \" for \" ontology \"  meta node professor b: I don't know . grad e: could be professor b: This is this is getting into the thing I wanna talk about next , grad e: so this professor b: which is s if that 's true  how do we wanna combine those ? O or when it 's true ? grad e: but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have at most four at the moment  arrows going f to each of the  bottom decisions . grad e: It 's too much ? professor b: Well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big CPT , it 's not s completely impossi  it 's it 's not beyond what the system could solve but it 's probably beyond what we could actually  write down . grad c: is that what that professor b: Yeah ,  it 's and I don't think it 's gonna g e I don't think it 'll get worse than that by the way , so le that 's a that 's a good grad d: Mmm yeah . grad e: But but four didn't we decide that all of these had true or false ? So is it 's four professor b:  for go there , but not f but not for the other one 's three values for endpoint already . grad d: Yeah ,  you need actually three to the five because  well  if if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values grad c: Right . grad e:  for endpoint ? No it 's it 's sh professor b: EV - it 's the EVA . grad d: No it still has three , professor b: Since ta they will still have three . professor b: Each so you 're   from each point of view you 're making the same decision . professor b: So from the point of view of the ob of the entity grad e: Want to view that , yeah yeah . grad e: yeah grad d: This and also , the other places where , like for example consider endpoint view , it has inputs coming from user budget , user thrift professor b: Right . S so we 're we 're gonna have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode . And in fact I think it doesn't in the sense that  Read it , you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff I think it isn't like you have two hundred and fifty - six different  ways of of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place . But  What I was gonna suggest next is maybe we wanna work on this a little longer but I do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of  well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place what rule of combination is used there . professor b: how do they affect it ? And belief - nets have their own beliefs about  what are good ways to do that . So is it it 's it 's clearer n clear enough what the issue is , grad d: Right . professor b: right ? So do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this ? grad e: R basically w we just need to sort of in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gonna get this picture sort of  completely messy . professor b: Well , here he here 's one of the things that that I th you sh you no , I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface but you it would be great if you could actually just display at a given time  all the things that you pick up , you click on \" endpoint \" , OK and everything else fades grad e:   And I does anybody remember the GUI on this ? grad c:  d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make you know N - many belief - nets and then open them every time you wanted to look at a different one grad e:   grad c: vers cuz  grad e: It 's probably pretty easy do it to do it in HTML , just grad c: Yeah , but grad e:  grad d: HTML ? grad e: Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it 's respective , professor b: Yeah the well the b grad d: OK . grad e: but professor b: anyway so  it clear that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram . professor b: Alright , so e we have to figure out some eh eh  basically display hack or something to do this because anyway I I let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations which is what are the  influences A , A , and B how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but  grad c: I don't , yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support something like that . Yeah , I  , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to  start modifying it for our purposes . Yeah , and  I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but  we have to know what we want first . OK , so why don't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what what the choices might be for these ? grad d: So Ah , sorry . So  recall the basic problem which is that  you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . Right ? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . So what  helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like  basically we wanna just take a combination of we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know ,  sorta weighted combination . So the problem is to specify the  so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So  that 's what we want , we want for example P of  let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example  E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X  hat or something ,  the co like all of them ? Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something right ? professor b: Yep . professor b: Alright , so  Is that  I yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on . professor b: It 's it 's cl e is is it clear what he wants to compute ? grad a:   So Basically  what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number grad a:   What we wanna do is find some principled way of  saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to  add up to one , right ? grad a:  . So what  I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the  we essentially take  averages , right ? So for example here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is  two out of four and probability of V is one out of four . Right ? So that 's step that 's the  yeah that 's the that 's the basic  thing . grad d: Is that all OK ? grad e: And that one outcome , that 's professor b: What ? grad e: it 's X X - one voted for A X - two voted for V grad a:   professor b: S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption , grad e: That 's the outcome . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the  the actual the  verbal content of what the person said , like what  what might be  somehow more  important than the  grad c: X - one matters more i than X - two or grad d: Right . Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by  W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four grad a:  . grad d: right ? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each  X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . So they can be for example , you know you you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say . And  grad c: So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case  we would still compute the average ? grad d: You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be  grad c: OK , so so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be  W one times grad a: Point three . grad c: or A or let 's see , one full quarter times point one grad d: Not one quarter , grad a: No . grad d: so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . So the next possibility is that  we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that  in certain situations one of the experts is more  reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \" , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . So what 's going on is that  this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the  thing . grad a: So so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . grad c: So H passes a vector on to the next node ? grad d: It could . grad c: It could ? A vector of the weights as the se grad d: Yeah , it could grad c: oh . grad d: Sorry ? grad a: Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ? grad c: Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems grad d: Right , so  the way you desc grad c: W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK . grad a:  Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK .  It it just seems that like without that that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if if  X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know ,  that seems like that 'd be weird , grad d: Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also . grad c: Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they they could either be hand coded or learned or OK . grad c: So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations .  Well ,  to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? Well  we need data with people intentions , right ? grad a: Right , right . But what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ? grad a: Like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ?   grad d: Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we  , how do we have data about something like   endpoint sub - E , or endpoint sub  you know s S ? grad c: Well , basically you would say , based on in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was , grad d: Mmm . I don't think , well you have a can you bring up the function thing ?  w where is the thing that allows you to sort of grad c: That 's on the added variable , isn't it ? grad d: Oh function properties , is that it ?  , I guess not . And  it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to  just write up little things that allow you to  create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's Right . Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here . By the way   just talking about  about that general end of things  is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , what kind of questions are being given being asked ? Cuz OK . I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know ,   w the figure I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's  that 's a whole lot of constructions and  you know ,  one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so ,  I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready .  , I I I I was  I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so Well , it will inspire me "

Yeah , I I I avoided that as long as I could for you guys , grad f: growl . grad d: Oh yeah , how di how d exactly did , that paper lead to anti - lock brakes ? grad f: Oh , I could tell you had a rough day , man ! grad d: Nah . grad c: Oh yeah , Liz suggested we could start off by  , doing the digits all at the same time . professor e: e grad a: Really ? Do we have to like , synchronize ? professor e: Well , I think you 're supposed to OK . grad f: Are you being silly ? grad d: Oh wait do we have t professor e: Everybody 's got different digits , grad c: Yep . professor e: right ? grad d: Yeah , do we have to time them at the same time or just overlapping grad f:  . grad a: And any rate ? professor e: e yeah , the grad f: Alright . professor e: Well , they they have s they have the close talking microphones for each of us , grad a: Yeah , that 's true . grad a: Are we gonna start all our meetings out that way from now on ? professor e: No . grad d: Are we to r Just to make sure I know what 's going on , we 're talking about Robert 's thesis proposal today ? Is that grad c: We could . grad d: Is professor e: Well , you you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do . grad c: Not not rehearse , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great . I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it grad a: I haven't looked at it grad c: because grad a: yet , grad c: but you could always send me comments per electronic mail grad a: but I will . grad c: the It basically says , well \" this is construal \" , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules how things are construed , and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what grad a:  . grad c:  ? grad d: OK , we can we can we can pass pass my ,  we can pass my extra copy around . grad d: Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it , grad f: Alrigh grad a: OK . grad c: actually this is the the newest version after your comments , grad f: OK . grad c: and professor e: Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . grad d: Oh , maybe the version I didn't have that I mine the w did the one you sent on the email have the professor e: Yeah . grad c: if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , up - to - d grad a: Oh . grad c: And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or grad a:   grad c: readability grad f: There 's only one \" S \" in \" interesting \" . grad c:  ? grad f: There 's only one \" S \" in \" interesting \" . And y  , email any time , but most usefully before grad d: The twenty - first I 'm assuming . grad f: That 's grad d: What , today 's the twenty - first ? grad f: Well , better hurry up then ! grad d: Oh , man ! grad a: Before the twenty - ninth , grad c: The twenty - ninth . grad c: That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to sell him this idea . grad c: OK ? Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML , about what we have done here and so of course , I 'm I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and  , then I 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning The Cave Forty - Five is a is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time . grad c: they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ?  , which is probably not , the case in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , SmartKom stuff , that we did , everth grad f: Oh , you 've got the parser done . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about  , actually I have an example , probably . grad c: But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer , grad f: Oh , OK . grad c: the you can observe that all the time , they 're trying to match their prosody onto the machine . grad c: Yeah , you have to grad a: Wh grad f: The system breaking .  , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , point out that it 's basically the same .  , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , some first , observations . Then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz ,  how to get there , what actually is happening there today , and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit as much as I can about the NTL story . I I wa I do wanna ,  I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and then , talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy . And , Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it , so from but I have the paper , I can make a resume of that , and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think . So X - schemas , then , I would like to do talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net . Should I mention the fact that , we 're also actually started going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ? professor e: You certainly can .  I y I you know , I don't know grad a: You might just wanna like , tack that on , as a comment , to something . professor e: Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking grad c: Yeah . professor e: and , you know , the yeah , yeah and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that grad c:   professor e: which , actually , i i even on your five - layer slide , you you 've got an old one that that leaves that off . grad c: But , you know , it would But I don't think I I am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter .  , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know , it would be nice to tell people how what 's happening there , plus how the , language learning stuff works , professor e: OK , so , so anyway , I I agree that 's not central . professor e: What you might wanna do is , and may not , but you might wanna this is rip off a bunch of the slides on the anal there the there we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , and , how the construction and simulation that ho that whole th grad c: Yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide , grad a: OK , right . grad c: so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy , grad a: OK , I can give you a more recent if you want grad c: one of Nancy 's st grad a: well , that might have enough . grad c: I yeah , but I also have stuff you trash you left over , professor e: OK . professor e: You could get it out of there , or some grad a: Which I can even email you then , you know , like there probably was a little few changes , not a big deal . Sorry grad c: Well , I I don't feel bad about it at all grad a: No , you shouldn't . grad c:  on the the , you 're that 's see , that 's you . grad c:  I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so . grad a: It 's it 's certainly related , grad c: Because , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig . Would professor e: Yeah , it 's different , this is the , DNA building , or someth the double helix building . professor e: The yeah it was it turns out that if if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things , and grad d: Wait , they 're building a building in the shape of DNA , grad a: What ? grad d: is that what you said ? professor e: Roughly , yeah . grad f: Oh ! Oh boy ! grad a: O professor e: Including cr cross - bridges , grad a: What ? professor e: and grad a: Oh my god ! grad f: That 's brilliant ! Hhh . professor e: You d you really now I I spent the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story which is ,  grad a: Of what grad d: Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research , grad a: the building ? grad d: you know ? professor e: Right . grad c: Well , the the offices are actually a little the , think of  , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in in the glass half - dome . grad c: But I th professor e: So , yeah , I think that 's that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , a lot of the this is interacting with , people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig and the the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . grad f: You might want to , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , you had a few , misspells in your slides , there . grad f: unless there 's a person called \" Jackendorf \" , grad a: On that one ? professor e: No , no , no . grad a: I 'll probably I c might have I 'll probably have comments for you separately , not important . professor e: So I did note i i it looks like the , metaphor didn't get in yet . grad c: it did , there is a reference to Srini professor e: Well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place Oh , did you put in something about , grad a: Metonymy and metaphor here , right ? professor e: the individual , we 'd talked about putting in something about people had ,  Oh yeah , OK . professor e: But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , you should , unless you put it in the text , and I don't think it 's there yet , about we talked about is the , scalability that you get by , combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . professor e: OK , so where where is it , cuz I 'll have to take a look . grad c: but I I did not focus on that aspect but ,  Ehhh , it 's just underneath , that reference to metaphor . grad c: But that 's really grad a: That 's not about that , is it ? grad c: Yeah . professor e: No , it it it s says it but it doesn't say it doesn't it d it d grad c: Why . professor e: Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , because it 's actually important , which is , that , the constructions , that , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , are , in a way , quite general but cover only base cases . And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level , it should com  , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work . professor e: And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then  , compose with all of the constructions . professor e: And it to the extent that that 's true then then it 's a big win over anything that exists . grad d: So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context - free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them . So that , you know , for example , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff you can do the same grammar . But , the trick is that the the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . Well , \" trouble \" isn't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container . So that 's that 's where this , grad d: So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule . So 's it 's it it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could . That is , there are physical containers , there are physical paths , there you know , et cetera . grad c: But \" walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , \" and \" walked into the cafe and broke his nose , \" that 's sort of professor e: Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous .",
        " professor e: a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as as a obstacle , grad f:  - huh . professor e: But it does say that , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle . professor e: And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading . grad d: You con you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so I thought , \" Why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ? \"  , oh ,  grad f: He slipped on the wet floor . grad c: You don't find that usage , I checked for it in the Brown national corpus . grad c: The \" walk into it \" never really means , w as in walked smack professor e: But \" run into \" does . grad c: Yeah , but , y y if you find \" walked smacked into the cafe \" or \" slammed into the wall \" professor e: Yeah , no , but \" run into \" does . professor e: Because you will find \" run into , \"  , grad d: Cars run into telephone poles all the time . grad a: Yeah , \" run into \" might even be more impact sense than , you know , container sense . professor e: But Like , \" run into an old friend \" , it probably needs its own construction .  , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else grad a:   professor e: and maybe it is , but , there are idioms and my guess is that 's one of them , but ,  I don't know . grad f: Sudden surprising contact , professor e: Yeah , but it 's it 's it 's it 's Right . It 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial professor e: Well , this is this motivated but yeah grad f: Yeah . professor e: oh yeah , mo for sure , motivated , but then you can't parse on motivated . grad a: There 's there 's lots of things you could make T - shirts out of , but , this has gotten  wh We don't need the words to that . grad a: What ? Oh , no no no no no no no no no , we 're not going there . professor e: anything else you want to ask us about the thesis proposal , you got grad c: Well , professor e: We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it . grad c: Well there actually the i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this , from our domain . grad a:  wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff , grad c: How grad a: as well as , mappings ? grad c: w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something professor e: Right right r grad c: and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the to the domain . professor e: OK , f let 's let 's suppose you use \" in \" and \" on \" . professor e: So \" in the bus \" and \" on the bus , \"  , that 's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms . grad c: I had two hours w with George on this , so it , professor e: OK , what did he say . Oh , h that 's grad c: \" On the bus \" is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on on that path and th w  it 's he there 's a platform notion , professor e: Yeah , I I believe all that , it 's just grad c: right ? \" he 's on the standing on the bus waving to me . grad c: But th the regular as we speak \" J Johno was on the bus to New York , \" professor e: Yeah . grad c: he 's that 's , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something , professor e: Yeah . grad c: where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , professor e: Yeah . professor e: like \" under the bus , \" or something , where grad c: But it 's it 's unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say . grad c: And there 's a lot of \" out of \" analysis , so , professor e: Right . grad c: could we capture that with a different construal of grad a: Yeah , it 's a little it 's ,  we 've thought about it before ,  t  to use the examples in other papers , and it 's it 's a little complicated . Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of there 's resource , grad f: Out of out of film , in particular . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource . grad f: yeah , grad a: It 's a little bit grad f: but and plus the fact that there 's also s  , can you say , like , \" The film ran out \" you know , or , maybe you could say something like \" The film is out \" grad a: Yeah , is film the trajector ? grad f: so like the the film went away from where it should be , namely with you , or something , right ? You know . The the film the film is gone , right ?  , I never really knew what was going on ,  I I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that that \" I 'm out of film \" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that , grad a: It 's weird . professor e:  b but the difference grad c: Is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it . professor e: But ,  grad f:  ! professor e: Yeah , so so nob so no one has in in of the , professional linguists , grad a:  . grad a: There was ? Who ? professor e: Well , there I thought or there was a paper on it . professor e: Huh ? grad f: There was one on on \" out \" or \" out of \" ? professor e: There was a Well , it may be just \" out \" . professor e: I think there was \" over \" but there was also a paper on \" out \" . grad f: Yeah , Lind - Susan Lindner , grad a: Oh , yeah , you 're right . grad f: right ? The the \" the syrup spread out \" ? professor e: Yeah , and all that sort of stuff . And undoubtably there 's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics , professor e: OK . So ,  grad a: It 's not one of the y it 's more straightforward ones forward ones to defend , so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes grad c:   grad a: th these are you 're addressing like , computational linguists , professor e: OK . Or are you ? grad c: There 's gonna be four computational linguists , grad a: OK . But more emphasis on the computational ? Or emphasis on the linguist ? grad c: computer it 's More there 's going to be the just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists . I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes grad c: Oh , the thesis ! grad a: Oh , I meant this , professor e: it 's just for one guy . grad c: That 's that 's computa should be very computational , grad a: you know , like OK . grad a: You know , it 's an obvious one grad f: Totally weird stuff . grad c:  the the old bakery example might be nice , grad a: but ,  grad c: \" Is there a bakery around here \" . grad a: Around ? grad c: No , it 's the bakery itself grad a: Oh . grad c: is it a building ?  , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ? grad a: Oh , oh yeah . The question is d do you wanna do you wanna construe do you wanna constr - strue grad f: Sh grad d: It 's a speech - act . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that that i for example , if y grad a: Yeah . But the other is , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or , grad f:   professor e: pfff you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery grad f: Yeah . professor e: But  , those are interesting examples but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples . grad a: So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that grad f: Yeah . professor e: So let 's so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . So let 's first do a So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the Though , the one you have isn't quite grad a: You mean the s You mean \" the steak wants to pay \" ? professor e: N no not that one , that 's that 's a the sort of background . grad c: How old is it ? How much does it cost ? grad d: Oh . grad a: To go in , that 's like grad f: Two hundred million dollars . grad a: Like , \" it \" doesn't refer to \" thing , \" it refers to acti you know , j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist you could think of it that way , but . grad f: Well , shoot , isn't that  , that 's what grad c: Well , my argument here is it 's it 's it 's the same thing as \" Plato 's on the top shelf , \" grad f: figuring that out is what this is about . grad c: I 'm con you know , th that you can refer to a book of Plato by using \" Plato , \" grad a: Yeah . No no , I I 'm agreeing that this is a good ,  grad c: and you can refer back to it , and so you can Castles have as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say \" Where is the castle , how much does it cost ? \"  . grad c: So , You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so , grad a:  . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of \" where \" in the tourist 's domain ?  . professor e: So you know it 's you you can sometimes use \" where \" f for \" when \" grad f: O professor e: in the sense of , you know , where wh where where was , \" where was Heidelberg , in the Thirty Years ' War ? \" Or something . grad f: Like what side were they on , grad a: What ? professor e: Yeah .  , grad a: Ah ! Or like its developmental state or something like that , you could I guess you could get that . grad f: there 's also things like  , s  , I guess I could ask something like \" Where can I find out about blah - blah - blah \" in a sort of doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , just give me a phone number professor e: Yeah . grad f: and I 'll call them or something like that ? professor e: You know , \" Where could I learn its opening hours , \" or something . professor e: So we 're thinking about , or we could also think about ,  grad c: Well , I I I professor e: How about \" I 'm in a hurry \" ? grad a: State . professor e: It i But it 's a state and the the issue is , is that it may be just a usage , grad f:  ? professor e: you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , I don't know . grad a: I 'm really into professor e: Ah ! How about I I I you know , \" I 'm in I 'm in a state of exhaustion \" ? grad a: Do you really say that ? professor e: or something like that , which a tourist w Huh ? grad a: Would you really say that ? professor e: A st  , well , you can certainly say , you know , \" I 'm in overload . grad a: Yeah , I was gonna say , like grad d:  professor e: Oh , you can do that ? Really ? Of course that 's that that 's definitely a ,  grad f: Fixed . grad a: There 're too there 're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't like  \" I 'm out of sorts now ! \" professor e: Right . grad a: Like \" I 'm in trouble ! \" grad c: Well I when ,  just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec professor e: Yeah . grad c: So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build professor e: Right .  , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know , ev something that puts on exhibits , so forth . grad a: Why don't you want to use any of those ? grad c:  ? grad a: So y you don't wanna use one that 's grad c: Yeah , well No , but this that 's what I have , you know , started doing . professor e: The castle the that old castle one is sort of grad c: Metonymy , polysemy . grad c: But I think the argument should be  , can be made that , you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical , professor e: Yeah . grad c: construal still is , you know , completely , key in terms of finding out any of these things , so ,  . So that 's that 's that 's a that 's a reasonable point , that it in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy . grad c: We ,  I with a I looked with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy . grad c: But OK this is just something we 'll we 'll see , professor e: Right . I guess if anybody has additional suggestions , grad c:  maybe the \" where is something \" question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request . grad c: So , if we 're not talk about the lexic grad a: Location versus what ? grad c: instruction . grad a: Oh , I thought that was definitely treated as an example of construal . grad a: Right ? grad c: Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , that 's sort of one level higher . grad c: Also it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example , professor e: We grad c: so , even temporal references are just in the spatial domain are rare . professor e: What was this p instead of wh what you know how was this painted , what color was this painted , was this alleyway open . grad c: We c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth . grad d: For some reason when you said \" feedback electronically \" I thought of that you ever see the Simpsons where they 're like the family 's got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying ? grad a: Yeah "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "grad e: Hello ? professor a: So everybody everybody 's on ? phd d: Today 's professor a: Yeah . professor a: eh e and  I guess Chuck you weren't there either , so the  phd b: I was there . professor a: Oh you were there ? phd b: With Hynek ? professor a: Yeah . professor a: What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ? phd c: So we had professor a: I forget . phd c: So the fact that there there is no  low - pass filtering before the downsampling . phd c: There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not  the best w m professor a: Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . So we discussed about this , about the  professor a: Was there any conclusion about that ? phd c:  \" try it \" . So again this is th this is the downsampling  of the  the feature vector stream phd c:  . professor a: and  Yeah I guess the the  LDA filters they were doing do have   let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so  the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? phd c: We don't have yet professor a: Oh OK . And the third point  was the  , yeah , the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay professor a: Yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , \" we can try it but \" professor a:  - huh . professor a: Try try what ? phd c: So try to   take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's  , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot .  and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it , professor a: Right . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,  the the mean normalization and Yeah . phd c: And this was this LDA  tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his  TRAPS , so . phd c: Yeah , professor a:  I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides phd c:  . professor a:  I was talking with Hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much . And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you phd c:   professor a: and they were sort of waiting for you and and and  we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had hadn't thought of that .  it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue phd c: Yeah . Well professor a: in in  the other phd c: Yeah I don't know what happened really , but professor a: Yeah . Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem and they told us \" well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network \" but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and professor a: Then they couldn't . Well maybe we should just   you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this machines are busy and you 're busy phd c: Yeah . professor a: Let 's let 's , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that  there there will be  in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly   do something about noise phd c:   professor a: in addition to the  other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that it sounded like   things looked very promising up there in terms of  I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something and in addition to They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? phd c: Yeah , yeah . phd c: And phd d: Yeah , I modified it well , modifying I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . and we have some the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . phd d: and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't professor a: When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ? phd d: No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have phd c: Yeah . So  I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on . grad f: Oh  Well  I haven't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today professor a:   grad f:  and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for  running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . grad f:  I also  haven't got the code yet , I haven't asked Hynek for for the for his code yet . Cuz I looked at  Avendano 's thesis and I don't really understand what he 's doing yet but it it it sounded like  the channel normalization part  of his thesis  was done in a a bit of I don't know what the word is , a a bit of a rough way  it sounded like he  he he it it wasn't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation but I I 'm not sure if it 's what I 'd wanna use so I have to I have to read it more , I don't really understand what he 's doing yet . Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again , phd d: It 's my phd c: Oh yeah ? phd d: I know this is mine here . The  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment  of sorts between the distant grad f:  I I 'm ho Right . grad f: I I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Yeah actually  he should  I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing  a different cancellation . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings . So  this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close close - miked  cases  we 'd like to be able to have  other sounds from other people and so forth removed from So when someone isn't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be So what they 're talking about doing is using ec  echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but  just   taking the input from other mikes and using   a  an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that  other speech .  what was it , there was there was some some some point where eh  Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else  which was in the background and it was not it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike . phd b: Yeah that was actually my I was wearing the I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , professor a: Oh you it was you I was Yeah . phd b: and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to  work on that . And  I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning  I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning . So continuing to  extend phd b: What about the stuff that  Mirjam has been doing ? And and S Shawn , yeah . professor a: But that 's   all that 's is a a certainly relevant  study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . professor a:  what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found finding useful phd c:  . professor a:  for phd b: And their their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that but   so  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that ? Yeah . professor a: There 's those that  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on  what \" good features \" are and phd b: What does what did  Larry Saul use for it was the sonorant  detector , right ? How did he H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ?   professor a: And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from . So  , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft \" AND - OR \" or you do something , you know , more complicated  and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then  doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ? This is the phd b:  ! professor a: And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . professor a: Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements . You could what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things professor a: Yeah . phd b:  ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that people have done studies like that w way way back right ?  I can't remember where  Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ?  , researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . professor a: Do you mean eh but you  Mar phd c: Well he was the guy the guy that was using professor a: you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ? phd b: Mark Randolph . phd c: Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or ? phd b: I can't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know I just remember it had to do with you know  positional parameters phd c: What Yeah . So the only the only  hesitation I had about it since ,  I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them . professor a: I don't know how complicated it is to go from there What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it and it 's e but it I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas  if you did something instead that like  having some manual annotation by  you know , linguistics students , this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before phd b:   professor a: but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .  the other thing you could do is boot trying to to  get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from  the   the data itself there , but I I 'm not sure phd b: Could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering ? professor a: Guess you could , yeah . So anyway that 's that 's  that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .  in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at , it 's gonna be hidden variable because we 're not gonna get everybody sitting in these meetings to wear the pellets and  . phd b: So you 're talking about using that data to get  instead of using canonical mappings of phones . phd b: So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the the true mappings are for each phone ? grad e:   So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that  we 're looking at different ways that we can combine  different kinds of of rep front - end representations  in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from  multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one  articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other methods we have , since  , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that that it it  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on  a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than  just assuming that you should train e e every detector  with equal strength towards  it being this phone or that phone . It 's a soft \" AND \" , I guess but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he \" OR 's \" across the different soft \" OR 's \" across the different  multi - band channels . And  the weight yeah , the target for the training of the \" AND \" \" AND ' ed \" things is something that 's kept  as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is is  taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that phd b: So he doesn't have professor a: which means that it 's it 's  i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to   train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band . You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure . professor a: And we don't We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting . phd b: So he doesn't have to have truth marks or Ho grad e: F right , and  he doesn't have to have hard labels . professor a: Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant . But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up  what he doesn't depend on as truth is grad e: Right . professor a:  I guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? grad e: Right . professor a: Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . professor a: then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision . And   we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything  with with  equal strength . professor a: And  because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had  enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But  this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you don't necessarily want to train everything up towards the phd b: So where did he get his  his tar his  high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? grad e: From  canonical mappings  at first phd b: OK . grad e: and then it 's unclear  eh phd b: Using TIMIT ? or using grad e: using TIMIT phd b:  - huh .  we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,  so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's it 's not I think it s doesn't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands . professor a: Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's  setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band . Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target   embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times  f the forward  do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .  what 's next ? phd b: I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . You 're playing ? phd b: I  Huh ? professor a: You 're playing ? phd b: Yes , I 'm playing .  so I wanted to do this experiment to see   what happens if we try to  improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this  I think I sent around last week a this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where I would take the  the original  the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then  optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then  do the same thing for the ICSI - OGI front - end . professor a: What which test set was this ? phd b: This is that I looked at ? professor a:   phd b: So as far as I 've gotten is I 've  been able to go through from beginning to end the  full HTK system for the Italian data and got the same results that  that  Stephane had . So  I started looking to and now I 'm I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wanna know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to  to improve it . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use the same number of states for all of the models professor a:   phd b: and so I went on - line and I  found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits professor a:   phd b: and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits .  you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a an  system is that you use  three states per phone and  so then the the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use  models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . And so  their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five which  , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . So my guess  And then if you I I printed out a confusion matrix   for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that you know , if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really  have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states ,  you 've got you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've gotta train in each case , professor a:   phd b: but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . phd b: So it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's because you have so many states , you just don't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So  I 'm going to try to  create more word - specific   prototype H M Ms to start training from . professor a: Yeah , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word , phd b:   phd b: Yeah so I 'll I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gonna try is to just  you know create  models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . phd b: And as part of that  I wanted to see sort of how the  how these models were coming out , you know , what w when we train up  th you know , the model for \" one \" , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the  what do the transition probabilities look like in the self - loops , look like in in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an  just by looking at the transition matrix professor a:   phd b: and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gonna sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , professor a:   I d I did quickly , I did the silence model and and  that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digits . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I I haven't calculated that for that one yet , but  . So they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . professor a: Are the SP 's optional ?  skip them ? phd b: I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . phd b: So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's it 's not gonna hurt a whole lot professor a: I see . phd b: and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own  It doesn't require its own training data , professor a:   phd b: So it , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but  i So I wanna play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wanna compare that in the the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . professor a: Yeah , I think that  , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . professor a: Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z phd b: Yeah . professor a: The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? phd b:   professor a: And  phd b: And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th  the the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , you wouldn't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . But you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . professor a: I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was  where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . professor a:  that 's another parameter , right ? that that maybe , you know ,  you really want three or nine or phd b: Yeah , yeah . Well one thing  , if I if if I start  reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models that 's gonna reduce the total number of Gaussians . professor a: how much better can you make it ? And  since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation phd b:   professor a: if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . I really wasn't even gonna play with that part of the system yet , professor a:  -  , OK . phd b: I was just gonna change the the t professor a: Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . So  what 's  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and phd c: Yeah , I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and retry the MSG and things like that . I think that after all of this   confusion settles down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has  been done by our group of people but  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that . phd b: Does anybody know how to  run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? grad e: I I think  Mike tried it phd b: Yeah ? grad e: and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . phd c: What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? grad e: What 's that ?  , Octave ? phd c: Yeah . phd c: And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or ? grad e:  i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that Matlab went to these like  you can have cells and you can you can  implement object - oriented type things with Matlab .  Octave doesn't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab  four point something or . phd b: If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff grad e: The basic stuff , right "

Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "marketing: Where are are all the other presentations ? industrial designer: I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be marketing: The conceptual or industrial designer: yeah I think so . Because I see only my own presentation user interface: industrial designer: No no no , can you go back one ? marketing: yeah . industrial designer:  'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it . industrial designer: 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the user interface: marketing: Ah , project manager: Ah . marketing: I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but project manager: You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . industrial designer: Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it .  we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to  f the remote control has to support . project manager: Yes ? industrial designer: Who wants to start ? marketing: Me first again or project manager: Yeah sure . So  the developments I will address them project manager: marketing: oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours .  Well the first aspect  was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . user interface: marketing:  nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours user interface: Yeah . Yeah you're just the user interface  ? user interface: It's better than than my  drawing . And I used  possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design .  I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you  what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking  type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours  , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not  solid straight lines anymore . user interface: project manager: industrial designer: There's a lot of options that we have to discuss .  we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . industrial designer:  the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . project manager: industrial designer: Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the project manager: marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know .  I wasn't able to finish my  personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . industrial designer: Well we have all kinds of hard  materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium .  we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . industrial designer: Electronics ? Yeah , maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement  for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . I first  chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . user interface: Or combine  both with a with one  project manager:  I think you can only fit one  source of energy on the industrial designer: Yeah maybe we marketing: I guess we can only choose one . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . I always chuck my  remote control around , so marketing: Yeah , just playing with it project manager: Yeah . It can be done , you can't harm it , project manager: S yeah it's safe . industrial designer: You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . marketing: So double curved is like this , this , this , or industrial designer: No it means curved in two dimensions . So  w single curved ?  let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . So  Yeah  yeah that's one thing  which I'm not sure  of how to implement it  into the remote control . project manager: Well the visual representation is not there with speech industrial designer: Design ? user interface: No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu  for functions and project manager: but you can Yeah . user interface: But do  j do we  do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? project manager: Both . Everybody says it so that's what's  yeah  Yeah in the in the last  meeting we  we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will  light up and then you can only  change the yeah the options . project manager: user interface: you have to  delete this but this is the the the simple  layout . user interface:  display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface:  project manager: You did read the minutes I wrote ? user interface: What ? A little bit I think but not not everything w industrial designer: I project manager: Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . user interface: But But this is the the basic  design  for the for the m yeah for the buttons . And  if there are older people they wanted more  yeah more  luxurous so that's an a also an option . Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ?  energy source , chip type , case type . industrial designer: Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and  and f audio function . industrial designer: I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , marketing: Kinetic . industrial designer: to be able to m project manager:  I didn't get any info on this . industrial designer: That's gonna be difficult huh ? marketing: The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? project manager: I have total here . project manager: Yeah the interface , maybe can user interface:  it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options  yeah .  do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . marketing: If you go to your homepage or something , you should industrial designer: Yeah I'm going there now . marketing: I got my fresh and fyoo fruity  picture  also  over there , so project manager: Ah you didn't draw it yourself . industrial designer: S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form  yeah serves the function , you know . industrial designer: where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And user interface: But it has also to it it has also to be  luxurous  for for yeah rich people . industrial designer: Yeah but that's that's the the problem  yeah the dilemma actually , project manager: Distinction . industrial designer: 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . industrial designer: Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , user interface: The colour Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it  make the colours with LEDs  beneath the the buttons . user interface: If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . industrial designer: To customise it and so  kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: and people who want something , you know , different , or more  design , they can go for one colour project manager: Different . marketing: industrial designer: Just give me the thing that it's inside there project manager: Yeah but this this the is for the . industrial designer: A compromise between what ? project manager:  instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . marketing: Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? project manager: Yeah that would be an option . industrial designer: And I I'm I'm thinking  you know  a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . user interface: Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . user interface: If you have  it have it in your hand , you you you are not only  yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . Something to shoot at your television industrial designer: Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , project manager: industrial designer: That would be a nice way to use it but  , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . marketing: Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have project manager: To switch from buttons to interface  . industrial designer: How about marketing: Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but industrial designer: Yeah I understand what you mean . marketing: That's  that's industrial designer: How about we do a  a pop-up screen , like the laptop . marketing: Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or industrial designer: And then if you want project manager:  so you have a the the side view . marketing:  maybe it's too much project manager: make this industrial designer: No  like project manager: . industrial designer: Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . user interface: But you you want industrial designer: F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? user interface: okay . industrial designer: So w w project manager: No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . project manager: and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto   automatically . Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your user interface: That's but it's it's not industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . marketing: An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of  thin rubber layer or something like that . industrial designer: That actually will offer some extra protection for the project manager: Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . project manager: What kind of industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th project manager: Harder . marketing: Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . project manager: industrial designer: That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f user interface: But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . user interface: But that's that's very expensive  industrial designer: Like like you drew here . user interface: We we could make some some rubber  some rubber  yeah mouse , with which you can change  industrial designer:  project manager: Oh yeah . marketing: we have to make industrial designer: Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . marketing: Yeah we we better so choose one industrial designer: And also the screen , you cannot mould it . marketing: But that's the kind of the idea , industrial designer: And then you can marketing: so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , industrial designer: You can place the screen here , which can come . marketing: yeah , you can use the button option project manager: So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? industrial designer: And but then I w I would marketing: Spongey . marketing: Spongey can be reached by means of industrial designer: Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , user interface: . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? industrial designer: I  y eah that's what  . industrial designer: or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? user interface: industrial designer: I dunno . project manager: Yeah that's user interface: marketing:  bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: so it's better to have  some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary  colours . industrial designer: Yeah we could make marketing: I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft green or something ? project manager: Orange or something . marketing: Or and then user interface: Or blue ? Dark blue or marketing: Oh yeah yeah , dark blue industrial designer: We should use marketing: and then and then very bright ,  a yellow banana , an orange ,  a green apple , stuff like that , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah but the primary colours w we can  create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you make it  just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , project manager: user interface: also for the for the more  yeah for the people . project manager: Y marketing: So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . industrial designer: Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , marketing: industrial designer: the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that  people lose their  remote controls often . marketing: Yeah ? industrial designer: So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or marketing: How do you mean ? project manager: Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . project manager: Well I think it's a bit too much but user interface: Maybe a industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is  pretty high . user interface: And which which colour should  should I give the the display ?  project manager: Who ? user interface: Or marketing: the the colour of the background of the display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty  sixty six five thousand  colour , so yeah too expensive . J industrial designer: As long as you loo use  high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . user interface: maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? industrial designer: So that people with  with marketing: White backlight , and dark . Or is it  too expensive ? marketing: But maybe  they have to they have to have some colour right ? project manager: It's difficult . industrial designer: But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? project manager: Yeah you can industrial designer: Like the pictures I showed you guys . user interface: It's it's not industrial designer: The green ? project manager: Why ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? project manager: They have LEDs but they have a colour . marketing: How do you mean ? project manager:  they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . Yeah I I was think about a red  red LEDs and blue LEDs and project manager: 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background marketing: No that's that's too busy I guess . project manager: So you can't change the colour so marketing: You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . industrial designer: what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with  one coloured LED behind it . industrial designer: as the colour the And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , marketing: industrial designer: but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . project manager: Okay with  Don't mean to discourage you but  basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . project manager: Yeah  about user interface: marketing: So wh how should I do that ? project manager: Yeah I don't know . marketing: because you are going to design it on this board right ? project manager: Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . industrial designer: So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? industrial designer: Alright . user interface: Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: So if you'll rather draw in paint or something industrial designer: Current colour ? marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah 'cause I have to  focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . And you have to think  how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . industrial designer: So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . industrial designer: so we kind of want the girlish marketing: project manager: That's included . Excuse me ? marketing: Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't  , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . industrial designer: How do we   marketing: Erase ? industrial designer: or insert text ? project manager: I dunno . industrial designer:  I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather  a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your project manager: Jesus . industrial designer: 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and user interface: The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . marketing: I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but industrial designer: Exactly but the  but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . user interface: Yeah the display , industrial designer:  don't you think ? user interface: we yeah we can put a display . industrial designer: So the display we will put in here , the basic  functions in here , where it's most reachable . user interface: industrial designer: What do don't have to draw it exactly do we ? user interface: No it's it's  it's okay . industrial designer: So this is gonna be from the marketing: I is it if if this is from the side industrial designer:  from user interface: From the marketing: woah . marketing: So then it's like this , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ? user interface: Yeah I'm I'm industrial designer: The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . user interface: May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . user interface: Because here marketing: It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . user interface: But why why do we need  the flipping  industrial designer: you can adjust the angle to which it flips . industrial designer: Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that user interface: marketing: user interface: Yeah . marketing: user interface:  the the shape is okay but yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping  mechanism . It's it's for for for more trendy  marketing: Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then user interface: Because we have enough space . marketing: Yeah there the middle Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? user interface: Yeah and then h we sh  . user interface: marketing: Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . user interface: Yeah , then it's marketing: So there's a layer of rubber on the side . project manager: marketing: So no flipping but just user interface: No flipping or project manager: No flipping ? marketing: no . user interface: you wanted the flipping so industrial designer: Yeah I guess but   most votes count right ? user interface: But if you if you If you drop it it it just breaks . user interface: And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . user interface: But there are more marketing:  they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their  remote  control . user interface: Okay wi industrial designer: Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . project manager: I don't see any power cables here so industrial designer: Let's see . But do we want  options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different project manager: industrial designer: right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons "

So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection , and , you you put up there data format , professor a:  . professor d: and other tasks during data collection , professor a: So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get professor d: and professor a: what can you add to it to get , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ? Like grad g: especially for querying . postdoc h: Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , i  , if he I ,  if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? grad g: Landay . postdoc h: La - Landay ? So he has , these , tsk note - taking things , professor a:   postdoc h: then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit . professor a: Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or  , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah . grad g: But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow , postdoc h:   And so , you know phd f: the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor . I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up professor a: So grad g: pretty easily . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things . So , if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful . professor d: I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at the front where we each said who we were . professor a: But anyway , shall we do the roll call ? professor d: No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So , yeah , I 'm Morgan , and where am I ? I 'm on channel three . postdoc h: Should we have used pseudo - names ? Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . professor d: I 'm Rocky Raccoon on channel phd e: Let me , turn that off . grad g: And , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z phd e: Oh . phd e: PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left . grad g: Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table , and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow . postdoc h: I have a question on protocol in these meetings , which is when you say \" Jimlet \" and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the Jimlet  , the box that contains the professor d: Well , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know . professor d: we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?  , do we have s people write summaries ? Everybody or one person ? And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ? Is that phd f: There 's there 're sub - problems in that , in that where or when do you actually ask them about that ? professor a: Right . phd f: that was One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then . phd f: But there 's a problem with that in that if you 're not If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question . professor d: There 's there 's another problem grad g: And professor d: which is , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder . And , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group and and , they were fine with it . But if we 'd said , \" OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , the summar \" grad g: Well , I asked them to and none of them did . grad g: So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting postdoc h:   grad g: So I didn't track them down and say \" please do th do it now \" . professor d: I I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random , professor a: Right . professor d: as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing . grad g: I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say \" that 's important , that might be a query \" . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , there are certain key words like , you know , \" action item \" and things like that , which could be used in , t to some degree finding the structure . phd e: Although professor a: W postdoc h: And and I also , was thinking , with reference to the n  , note - taking , the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later . And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards , I think they should be recorded instead of written because I think that , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary . professor a: How about this idea ? That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker . professor a: And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ? postdoc h: Yeah . grad g: that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ? phd e: Well . But , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . phd b: Actually And so grad g: James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me . professor d: Well , I think that we  , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings professor a: Well professor d: and send them off to IBM and get a bunch of transcriptions even if they 're slightly flawed grad g: Yep . professor d: And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least . So , if you could sense just when people are writing , and you tell them not to doodle , or try not to be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when . But I bet that 's that will allow you to go into the sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . phd b: you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . phd b: It may not be kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important . phd b: And that wouldn't take any extra postdoc h: That 's a nice idea . phd b: Or someone could just pu you could just put your hand on the pad professor d: It professor c:   It 's professor d: That 's a good idea but that doesn't Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ? professor a: Well , what it does phd b: Well , then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about . phd b: And grad g: y professor a: I I think it 's an interesting thing . I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se , but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say \" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? \" phd b: Yeah . professor d: That that 's what  , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , \" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? \" , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking . phd e: Well , see , there are th professor a: I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , when  , when did so - and - so s talk about blah . phd b: At least you can find the locations where there are maybe keywords professor d: Maybe . grad g: i this would tell you what the hit is , phd b: and grad g: not what the query is . grad g: And so you could you can generate a query from the hits , professor a: Right . grad g: but phd b: We don't even know what  , if you want to find out what any user will use , that might be true for one domain and one user , professor d:   professor d: Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that phd b:  . professor d: because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface and he 's looking at the query in in i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries . So he 's just sort of going \" where where do I where do I start ? \" professor a: w Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there , professor d: OK . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings . professor a: So \" action item \" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about . professor a: the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying \" here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? \" grad g: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary . professor a: Well grad g: But , I think it would give professor a: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary , grad g:   So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries . phd e: But th there is this ,  There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think \" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? \" And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you professor a:   phd e: And that 's kind of what this kind of , complete data capture is kind of nicest for . phd e: Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded . So ,  And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur . phd e: But  , it 's difficult to sort of say \" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? \" Those aren't the kind of things that come up . postdoc h: I also think that w if if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the of the meeting , then you might get something like y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection , you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , \" we discussed types of na data collection \" . If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it even if you don't have a direct route to that . postdoc h: I think that grad g: That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take . I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . phd b: No , but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note - taker grad g: But they phd b: And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on , and they can use it for their research .  , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system , grad g:   But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , professor d:   Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it . grad g: And so the question is \" is there such a person ? \" And I think right now , the answer is \" no \" . professor a: Well professor d: I 've b been thinking grad g: We 'll just have to see . professor d: I 've been thinking about it a little bit here about the  , th this , e  I think that the now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , is actually a reasonable , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at . It 's it 's not ideal , but we you know , we we have to get started someplace . So I was I was just thinking about , suppose we wanted to get w We have this collection of meeting . So now we have five hours of meetings and , you ask me , \" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? \"  , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go \" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting , I remember that , what was the part that \" And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries , professor d:   professor a:  phd b: So how does the summary get generated ? professor a: Well , i i ? phd b: I 'm not against the idea of a summary , grad g: By hand . phd b: but I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it professor a: Or , d o phd b: and how because the summary will drive the queries . professor a: What I I think , you know , in most meetings , phd b: So professor a: this one being different , but in most meetings that I attend , there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes , frequently on a laptop  , you can just make it be on a laptop , phd b:   professor a: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition . postdoc h: I I I think that , there 's we 're using \" summary \" in two different ways . postdoc h: And what I originally thought was , if you asked someone \" what was the meeting about ? \" phd b: OK . postdoc h: And then they would say \" well , we talked about this and then we talked about that , and so - and - so talked about \" And then you 'd have , like I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing because writing takes time and you get irrelevant other things that u take time , that professor a:   postdoc h: Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting , you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception . And , you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting , professor d:   professor d: A postdoc h: So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , professor a: OK . postdoc h: no longer than two minutes , professor d: Adam , you can postdoc h: from multiple people . professor d: but but , my impression was that , pretty much , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w  , with a laptop grad g: Never . Does anyone ? phd b: Dan ? professor d: I grad g: Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes , phd e: Yeah . Most of the meetings we have are four or five people grad g: That 's true are four or five people . professor d: and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . professor a: So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion . grad g: The IRAM meeting , they they take notes every professor d: Do they ? grad g: There 's  a person with a laptop at each meeting . phd b: I don't know how , but for instance , the outline is sort of up here and that 's what people are seeing . phd e: We sh we should grad g: I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video , postdoc h: I agree . phd e: f u I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera grad g: Yeah , different phd b: y phd e: just to take pictures of who 's there , where the microphones are , and then we could also put in what 's on the board . grad g: But don't you think that 's Don't you think that But postdoc h: I agree .  , I I just think  , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables . phd e: Not not as part of the not as a part of the data that you have to recover . phd e: Just just in terms of phd b: We should just Like archiving it or storing it . postdoc h: It 's i because discourse is about things , phd b: Because someone postdoc h: and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable . phd b: someone later might be able to take these and say \" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there phd e: So phd b: and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and \" and just postdoc h: Yes . professor d: Li postdoc h: Like you said , three snapshots professor d: L L L postdoc h: and professor d: Liz , you postdoc h: Just to archive . professor d: u  , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , subcommittee meeting or whatever phd e: Actually professor d: on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the ,  that workshop we were at that , Mark Liberman was was having . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that . But I 'm just saying first of all there 's a whole bunch of fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . And there 's also I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman in this kind of in storing these images in any data we collect professor d:   phd b: And professor d: I think you  , that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .",
        " professor d: And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it . professor d: So ,  grad g: But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it , and get all the standards , and to do anything with it . So we 're gonna So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do , whatever 's reasonable for us . phd b: I think even doing something very crude professor d: But having phd b: Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time . phd b: And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine . So if you can find some really , you know , low , perplexity , grad g: Low fidelity . And if it 's simple as  , as simple as just the digital phd b: Otherwise you 'd you lose it . professor d: Well , minimally , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people , postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so ,  grad g: Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier professor d: Yeah . grad g: But phd b: Also CMU has been doing this and they were the most vocal at this meeting , Alex Waibel 's group . And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time professor d:   phd b: and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room . So I think we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't collect it at all . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded . grad g: So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say \" I won't participate \" . phd b: Or you could put a paper bag over everybody 's head grad g:  phd b: and not look at each other and not look at boards , and just all be sitting talking . phd b: That would be an interes Bu postdoc h: Well professor d: Great idea . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards , phd b: Yeah . postdoc h: sp spatial organization And you could anonymize the faces for that matter . You know , this is grad g: But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work . postdoc h: We can talk about the grad g: To set it up and then anonymize it ? postdoc h: It 's just one snapshot . phd b: No , it wa n not ,  professor a: No , no , no , no . Maybe we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it , phd f: Did they store it digitally , or ? postdoc h: but phd b:   I think they just phd f: or just put it on videotape ? phd b: I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Well , I think for  , for our purposes we probably will d phd b: I 'm not sure . professor d: we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think . postdoc h: Th The thing is , if it 's easy to collect it it th then I think it 's a wise thing to do because once it 's gone it 's gone . And phd b: I 'm just The community If LDC collects this data u  , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect , there will probably be some video data in there . phd b: And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , easier made easier if you had the video . professor d: I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing . professor d: As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , and and will include all that . professor d: professor a: e professor d: I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing . But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , subsets of that . Like for a meeting like this , at least , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards , phd b: Of the board . phd b: Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board . professor d: a and know the position of the people phd b: That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . phd b: otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .  , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording . grad g: except in postdoc h: s grad g: er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost .  , I just think that the grad g: The point is that we 're not saving it anyway . postdoc h: Well professor a: What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ? I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board , is in the record . postdoc h: Well professor a: Well , that 's why that 's why I 'm saying that I think the note - taking would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking , in which case , that 's a useful thing to have  , we  , we don't need to require it . professor a: so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications . professor d: So So , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody from from today ? OK . professor d: So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection . professor d: And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries and are we gonna do anything about that . professor a: So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ? professor d: Yeah . professor a: So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it , unless you think that the CrossPads are gonna n I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not . professor d: I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff . professor d: So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . professor d: So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero , professor a: Nothing . professor d: and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou professor a: OK . phd b: I think it 'd be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept . grad g: And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me . I think it it it will again depend on Landay , and if he has a student who 's interested , and how much infrastructure we 'll need . grad g: but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it . professor d: I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot in one sense or another . That if if people have something in front of them phd b: I 'd be sort of cool . So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ? grad g: Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting . professor d: So who who does this summarization ? postdoc h: Yeah , I 'm thinking that grad g: People in the meeting . grad g: You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go , postdoc h:  - huh . phd e: People with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other . phd b: Well , then you should try them a few weeks later postdoc h: How fascinating . phd b: and They have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain grad g: And see score them ? phd e: That 's right . phd b: and wasn't phd e: If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently . professor a: But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it , professor d: Ru grad g: I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though . professor a: because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . grad g: Maybe e Is email easier ? postdoc h: Well , I think if grad g: I when you first said do do it , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up postdoc h:   postdoc h: Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is , and th and closest to the meeting time too , cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave . But , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay . professor a: But , you know , if you get even one postdoc h: w professor d: Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , postdoc h: I would s Yeah . professor d: that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . postdoc h: And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be  , phd e: Yeah . postdoc h: Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed , phd e: Right . postdoc h: just phd f: So I have a question about queries , grad g: God , that 's bugging me . phd f: which is , grad g: Can we turn that light off ? postdoc h: You turn phd f:  grad g: If can we turn that just that that let professor d: The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . grad g: Yeah , there 's a phd b: Oh , it is it is like OK . professor a: That and y Too much caffeine and really tired , grad g: Too much caffeine . phd f: the question I had about queries was , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ? Are are we gonna try and o grad g: We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ? phd f: Yeah . phd f: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?  , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself , professor d: Mmm . phd f: n phd b: Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? professor d: Yeah . phd b: They 're the expert phd e: Mari ? professor a: Yeah ? phd e: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up . Is someone picking you up ? professor a: what 's our schedule ? professor d: Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz . professor a: Let 's see , you and I need dis  , no , we did the Liz talk . professor a: We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart . So , grad g: And what ? professor a:  professor d: I 'm at your disposal . professor a: what what 's the plan for this discussion ? We should professor d: I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ? grad g: At least . professor a: So , I think phd b: It 's interesting that he 's got , like , this discussion free professor d: Well , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on . professor d: And professor a: e e why don't you say five - thirty ? I don't phd e: OK , five - thirty . grad g: Well , in answer to \" is it Landay 's problem ? \" , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff . professor d: Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things but it can't be , yeah , very deep . u I I actually think that that , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .  , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area , and the people are talking about and and ,  phd b: But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . phd f: Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem . phd f: Right ? Of how to how to generate queries from a phd b: How to do this from the summary . phd b: So what you want to h to do is , people who were there , who later see , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . phd b: and , like , make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer , or or a deeper Yeah . phd b: You postdoc h: I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be \" what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? \" Becau - in terms of like informativeness , phd b: That 's a good one . postdoc h: it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact . professor a: But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting . postdoc h: Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about . postdoc h: So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary . But with the \" what 's the most interesting thing you learned ? \"  , so the fact that , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting phd b: Going to see the kids . So , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings professor a:   professor c: Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them ? grad g: As many are willing to do it . Cuz you 'll get cuz you 'll get very different answers from everybody , right ? professor c: and then Yeah . phd e: So grad g: Well , maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we 've already done  , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . professor a: But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned , grad g: Mmm . postdoc h: And that I think it would pick up the micro - structure , the some some of the little things that would be hidden . professor d: Boy , I I don't know how we get at this postdoc h: That would be interesting . professor c: Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something grad g: Or want to get up and leave . professor c: and then you go around the room and they say \" yeah , me too , I agree . professor c: So phd e: On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones , right ? professor d: Well phd e: They might say \" oh , I was gonna say that one but now I have to think of something else \" . grad g: Well , you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it . We 'll  , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say .  , It seemed The kind of , interest that I had in this thing initially was , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later , professor a:   So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else professor a: Right . professor d: in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even . So it 's it 's that you 're trying to find You 're you 've now You weren't interested Say I I said \" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person \" . professor d: But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm \" well what is what was that part that that that , Mari was saying ? \" grad g: Yeah , like Jim Bass says \" add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf \" professor a:  professor d: Yeah . professor d: And then I 'm trying to fi  , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff . professor a: Well , I That 's hard to generate professor d: So , I don't I don't know . phd f: Do we professor a: and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times  , make you know , think to myself \" this is interesting , professor d:   professor a: So , things that I think are interesting , I would be , wanting to do a query about . And also , I like the idea of going around the room , because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it . That that might get at some of what I was I was concerned about , being interested in something later that w  , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't , but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up . grad g: But But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . grad g: Yeah , I I think you can't get at all of it , professor d: Yeah . phd f: The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know , introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ? professor d:   But postdoc h: Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying \" important \" and we 're saying \" interesting \" . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that  , postdoc h:   professor d: W phd f: does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ? professor d: Well , irreversible . phd f: That 's that 's professor d: I I  , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system postdoc h: Yeah . professor d: so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later , even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and ,  and ask the questions that they actually want to know . If you know , if  , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . postdoc h: I will say that that I I chose \" interesting \" because I think it includes also \" important \" in some cases . postdoc h: Well , and and also i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate .",
        " You know , I think inter \" interesting \" is is non - threatening in professor a: OK - OK . professor a: In the interest of , grad g: Importance ? postdoc h: Yeah . professor a: No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here , and also moving on to action items and other things , let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important , that we at least decided on . CrossPads we were going to try , if Landay can get the ,  get them to to you guys , and see if they 're interesting . professor a: getting just , digital pictures a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .  , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting , postdoc h: k professor a: and that way you 'll get more variety . \" And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary . professor a: OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ? That well , that we want to do ? postdoc h:   grad g: Yeah , that 's like n I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then . postdoc h: And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database . phd e: there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries they really want to ask at some point . phd e: And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down . grad g: Give them a reward , a dollar a query ? phd e: Yeah , really . So professor d: Well , and again , if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system , say in a year , then  , so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to postdoc h: Yeah .  , the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ? grad g: Well , we 're gonna phd b: So you need to have some sort of if you start working with queries , some way of identifying what the you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement on this issue of all the people who ha phd e:  . phd b: In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level . phd b: It But it may well grad g: But professor d: Because  , b because it depends on , what our goal is . grad g: Really ? professor d: If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish , we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . professor d: And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , phd e: Yeah . grad g: Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings . phd e: Well just imagine if professor d: But but just phd e: Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , professor d: Yeah . w Just \" what would you like to know ? \" phd e: but grad g: Yep . postdoc h: I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries which is indicator phrases like \" action item \" , professor a: OK . postdoc h: Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , phd b: Well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you . phd b: So , in general , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this . Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , \" other than your action item \" , you know , whatever . phd e: Well postdoc h: But but the action item would be a way to get , maybe an additional query . Well , but you know , but you could get again @ @ professor a: Well , we 're piloting . professor a: or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed and then we will hav professor d: We we had  , phd e: Yeah . professor d: somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , from the description things ? professor a: I got Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them . professor d: And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed . What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , requirements . professor a: people are supposed to send me U R for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover . We professor a:  ? phd e: we need to look at our web page professor a: And and you also need to look at your web page phd e: and make one that 's that 's p professor a: and clean it up by mid - July . And so ,  professor a: How about if I just c  , Right now all I want I personally only want text data . I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . professor d: Wh postdoc h: You could email to both of us , just  , if you wanted to . postdoc h: I don't think either of us would mind recei professor a: OK . postdoc h: but but in any case I 'd be happy to send you the professor a: And your email is ? professor d: i postdoc h: Edwards at ICSI . professor a: And then professor d: In in our phone call , before , we we ,  It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , And ,  and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , that will grad g: Oh , is this IBM ? professor d: Yeah . postdoc h: Yeah , using foot pedals professor d: Yeah , foot foot pedals postdoc h: and professor d: and grad g: so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ? professor d: See , that 's a good question . professor d: probably about like you did , grad g: Mix ? professor d: and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well . And that 'll go back to IBM and they 'll they 'll ,  they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that . professor d: We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff grad g: So we 'll give them all sixteen channels professor d: and grad g: and they 'll do whatever they want with it . phd b: But you also should probably give them the mixed You know , equal sound - level professor d: Yeah . professor d: It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed . phd f: But w phd b: I phd f: It 's not professor a: Right . phd b: You should that may be all that they want to send off to their transcribers . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did . I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL , the on - line , data that Adam set up , The URL so they can click on an utterance and hear it . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have , cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up postdoc h: Good . grad g: And then p possibly postdoc h: I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . grad g: Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information . We were gonna grad g: Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . professor a: That 's postdoc h: Well ,  professor a: W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work phd e: Well  , yeah . So , what n important thing professor a: but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data , postdoc h: Well , it c phd e: Right . professor d: So a key thing will be that you we tell you postdoc h: Great . phd f: and \" professor d: We also had the ,  that we were s  , that you were gonna get us the eight - hundred number professor a: Oh , yeah . professor d: and we 're all gonna we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be good slash bad , depending on how you define it , users . professor c: Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users . Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , professor a: Yeah . Or , like if you have a professor c: who know that you shouldn't hyper - articulate , for instance , and things like that . professor a: Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you , professor c: So . e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations . professor d: My mother would have a very interesting conversation with it grad g: He would never use it . So I have the professor d: We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends , w e e e they 're you know , they 're p m If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , major communications between Dan and UW folks phd e: Yeah .  , professor a: I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August . professor d: as to phd e: we should talk about it , but postdoc h: Mmm . professor a: So , you know , if professor d: But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know .  , he he s  , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust professor a: We don't know . professor d: and and so we don't know , professor a: i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , professor d: i e professor a: but a at least it 's worth trying .  , and I will email these notes  , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff , although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads . professor d: and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have grad g:   professor a: Oh ! professor d: some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can play with them for a language model . phd e: Yeah , that was  , that was What he was saying was this he this thing that , Jason had been working on finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . But it 's p it might be phd e: so professor a: But but that 's actually what I wanna do . grad g: Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant . If I don't get something grad g: Who ? Landay or Jason ? professor a: Landay . professor a: you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers or I could I could use ,  I could use your web pages . You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor professor d: Yeah , why search for them ? professor a: Yeah ! professor d: They 're we know where they are . professor d: There 's there 's some , Carnegie Mellon stuff , right ? On on meeting recording , grad g: Yep . professor a: So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox , professor d: and phd b: And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , professor d: And Xerox . phd b: smart rooms , grad g: the \" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand \" is a good one . J There 's th That 's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera , professor a:   phd b: because of all these classroom grad g: Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of . postdoc h: Can I ask , one thing ? It relates to data data collection and I and I 'd and we mentioned earlier today , this question of  , so , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , are lessened . But I wonder if  , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , u w we would c  , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever . postdoc h: Now , you know , it 's true , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . phd f: Adam ! postdoc h: But , i i  , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ? professor d:  . phd e: turn off professor a: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys , postdoc h: OK . Just want to be sure there 's enough data to professor a: phd b: They 're still gonna overlap , postdoc h: OK , good . phd b: but Mark and others have said that there 's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic and also the political Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap . professor d: Wasn - but w I think we were saying before also that the natural language group here had less overlap . postdoc h: because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to . postdoc h: Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired . But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed . So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people postdoc h: Time . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . professor a: Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever . Well , I just as as as a contributary eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , \" wait till each person is finished before you say something \" . professor a: Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , unintrusive as possi postdoc h:   I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u  , you know , as much data as we can . Did they discuss any of that in the the meeting they had with L Liberman ? phd b:   professor d: What phd b: And there was a big division , professor d: What what do they phd b: so Liberman and others were interested in a lot of found data . phd b: So there 's lots of recordings that They 're not close - talk mike , professor d: Yeah . phd b: but And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings .  , and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings . And , I guess we just left it as @ @ that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it , professor d:   Is that is that going to be publicly available , phd b: As far as I know , they h have not . grad g: It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ? phd b: I 'm not sure .  , if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved . grad g: Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field , phd b: I think you need to talk to Waibel and grad g: intelligent - room sorts of things . phd b: But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations . Well , once we send out postdoc h: Yeah , I think professor d: we still haven't sent out the first note saying \" hey , this list exists \" . But but , once we do that professor a: Is that an action item ? professor d: Yeah . We should at least check that everybody here ? grad g: I think everyone here is on the list . grad g: I I added a few people who didn't who I knew had to be on it even though they didn't tell me . grad g: You are on it , aren't you ? postdoc h: Yeah , I am . So \" found data \" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ? phd b: What they mean is stuff they don't have to fund to collect , postdoc h: It sounds like such a t phd b: and especially good postdoc h: Yeah , OK . It 's things occur without any You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes , but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever . Of course it 's not \" found \" in the sense that at the time it was collected for the purpose . phd b: But what he means is that You know , Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , postdoc h: That 's interesting . phd e: We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ? professor a: Oh . phd b: Rrrh ! grad g: Now , I was already thinking about it , so professor d: Oh ! Good man . phd b: I grad g: So , I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ? Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that . postdoc h: Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things which is that , I I found this discussion very , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting . And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought was worthwhile . grad g: Did you take pictures of the boards ? phd e: Not that I postdoc h: Yeah .  , I will take pictures of them , but postdoc h: That 's a good point . phd f: I 'm gonna pass because I can't  , of the Jane took my answer . But I will say  , I will actually  , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , realizing that we could take minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , in this project . professor d: Well , being more management lately than than research , I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics and not any of the facts . phd e: How are we gonna find that in the data ? grad g: Well , if we had people wearing the wireless mikes all the time phd e: Oh , yeah . grad g: Yeah , I think phd f: Well , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . phd e: How happy were they ? professor d: I 'd probably search for something like that . postdoc h:  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ? professor d: Now these we turn off "

        "We've received apologies for absence from Janet Finch-Saunders, and also from Dawn Bowden, and I'd like to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, who is substituting for Dawn Bowden. We'll move on, then, to our evidence session for our inquiry on school improvement and raising standards. I'd like to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Steve Davies, director of education. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so we'll go straight into questions, if that's okay. If I can just start by asking you: to what extent is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development still involved in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey? kirsty williams am: First of all, can I thank the committee for their invitation this morning, and their interest in this particular area?\u00a0As you will be aware, on coming into office, the director and I agreed to ask the OECD to do a rapid review of the state of Welsh education at the beginning of this Assembly term. I was very clear in the national mission\u00a0that I would invite the OECD back to review our progress against that mission, and that has happened in the tail end of last year, and the OECD will publish their latest report on Welsh education next month now, in March. So, the expectation is that the report will be published on 23 March, and my intention is to make a statement to the Chamber on 24 March. Actually, the continuing relationship with OECD is about self-evaluation of the entirety of the system and Welsh Government. We don't want to accept our own orthodoxy and just be in a bubble where we are constantly listening to ourselves and those people who might want to agree with us or tell us what we want to hear. That's a risk for Ministers and for Government, because we want them to give an honest evaluation of where we are, but that's a really important tool for me, to ensure that we're constantly testing ourselves. The nature of that review is that the OECD were able to talk to whoever they felt it was important to talk to, so that included practitioners on the ground, elements of the middle tier, as well as Welsh Government. And I know, Chair\u2014I hope you'll be pleased to hear this\u2014that the reports of this committee have formed parts of their review, looking at how the Senedd itself has contributed to and has held the Government to account. Can I ask about the powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013, to ask you to tell us about the use of those powers either by Welsh Government or by local authorities, and how effective you feel that legislation has been? kirsty williams am: Okay. Well, as you'll be aware, local authorities have quite extensive powers of intervention in schools if they feel that is necessary. If I'm honest, I think there's a mixed picture, with some local authorities using those powers not on a regular basis, but obviously demonstrating a willingness to use those powers. Since that legislation came into being, there have been a number of reasons, because of course a local authority has to give a reason for using those powers of intervention. They usually focus on standards, but sometimes they focus on a breakdown in governance arrangements, perhaps, or a failure or a breakdown in financial management. And the types of interventions that have been used have included, in some cases, appointing additional governors to governing bodies, or suspending a school's delegated budget so the local authority takes on, then, financial control of that particular school, or sometimes applying to the Welsh Government to entirely replace a governing body and establish an intervention board. So, if I can give you an example of where that's been used and has been successful, in Flintshire. They applied to Welsh Government for two interim executive boards, in Sir Richard Gwyn Catholic High School and in Ysgol Trefonnen. The IEBs were put in place and both of those schools, which had been in special measures, moved quite rapidly, actually, out of special measures. Perhaps the most recent example of this is one that the Chair will know very well in her own constituency of Torfaen, in Cwmbran High School, where Torfaen has intervened in that case. My expectation always is that local authorities should be the first port of call, and I would encourage\u2014and we always encourage\u2014local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and to use those powers. Can I ask, then, about the national evaluation and improvement resource and how significant a role that will play in the raising of school standards, and how you feel it's evolved since it was first conceived? kirsty williams am: So, this brings us back to the principle of self-evaluation and something, if we're honest, we've not been very good at. If you look at a number of chief inspectors' reports into the Welsh education system, self-evaluation has always been identified as something that is missing or underdeveloped in our system to date, hence, then, the work to establish not a new approach, but a more robust approach to self-evaluation. We've done that in conjunction, again, with the OECD, middle tier and practitioners. It's really important, throughout the entirety of our reform journey that that's done in co-construction, because we want this resource to be usable in schools. So, it's all very well having a conceptual idea and people outside the classroom working on it, but if it's of no practical use to a school leadership team, then we won't see the impact. We're in the testing phase at the moment and having it evaluated itself, with a view to introducing that resource across the system at the start of the new academic year, in September 2020. I truly believe that, if we're to make progress in Welsh education, we have to develop the skills within our system to have robust self-evaluation. So, it's not left to an individual school to come up with a system; it's right the way across the system. My hope would be that those principles could then be applied to local education authorities, to regional school improvement services and Welsh Government as part of a whole-system approach to self-evaluation. steve davies: So, they have played a critical role and, as we know, as the Minister has said in the past, she may introduce policy and practice, but if Estyn are part of it then schools, usually, because they recognise that it will be part of the inspection process\u2014it gives it greater push and support around it. kirsty williams am: And I think, if I just say as well, that the external perception of what that's about is really important. It's not a test of school readiness for reform, it is a genuine attempt for a school to evaluate their strengths, their weaknesses and where they need to go next. And because of the word 'toolkit'\u2014the feedback was that it gave the impression of a checklist, 'Just do this and check list'. So, it'll be called the national evaluation and improvement resource, rather than the toolkit, because, as I said, the feedback was that 'toolkit' gave the impression of a checklist exercise, and it's got to be about more than that if it's going to be meaningful. lynne neagle am: Okay.\u00a0Before I bring Suzy in, can I just welcome Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, who is joining us via video-conference in north Wales? Morning, Si\u00e2n. suzy davies am: Yes, the resource, thank you\u2014about whether there were any conflicting ideas in the process of development that made it quite difficult to zone in on something that school leadership teams, in particular, could rely on. Were there differences of opinion on what this should look like? kirsty williams am: Not that I'm aware of from the practitioners that I've spoken to who have been part of that. The head of Gladestry has been involved in this process, and she said that she'd really enjoyed the process of working alongside Estyn and the OECD as a school leader to be able to shape it. suzy davies am: I'm not suggesting that there has been; I'm just interested as to how it had worked, that's all. steve davies: Chair, I think, inevitably, when you bring stakeholders together, they're not going to be in total agreement as to how it's going to work, and I think initially one of the challenges was having Estyn there as part of the facilitation group. There are always some concerns that, actually, it's coming from a to inspect, oral, judgmental tick box. So, we had some early day challenges where we had to convince\u2014and, ultimately, Estyn convinced them\u2014that they were there to help and support as opposed to to inspect, and that the model that was developed, as the Minister said, was not going to be a tick box, 'You are good at this part of self-evaluation', it was to build the skillsets up. You know, four years into the job, what I've reflected on as well is there is this sometimes a feeling out there that the Minister says all the right stuff, but you're not actually going to do it, so, when you talk about a new approach to doing things, you're not actually serious about it. So, trying to build that confidence that we are serious about developing a new system around self-improvement, which is different from accountability\u2014sometimes, the practitioners are like, 'Oh, yes, we've heard it all before but it never actually happens.' And I think that's been a part of the constant\u2014not pressure, but the responsibility on Welsh Government is in following through. So, we said that we were going to do this in the national mission, and we are going to do it. I'm really proud that there or thereabouts, a few months either way, we've actually kept to the timetable as outlined in the national mission, and that helps build confidence within the sector that we are committed to that programme and we're going to do what we say we're going to do. lynne neagle am: And a final question from me: how effective do you think the investment in school standards has been in this Assembly term, as opposed to the approach taken in the last Assembly term, where there was the protection put in place for core school budgets? kirsty williams am: Well, I think, first of all, it's important that, whilst this additional resource is specifically targeted at school standards, that is only a part of a much wider education budget, a budget that\u2014you know\u2014is incredibly complex. And so it is really challenging to be able to draw straight lines\u2014you know, 'We did this and it's resulted in that'\u2014given that we're looking at the entirety of school funding here. What's been really important is that, if you drill down into what that money has been spent on, 50 per cent of it has been directed towards professional learning in one form or another to support our teaching professionals. I've said it time and time again: an education system cannot exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out to work with them and teach them. Therefore, that investment in staff and investment in the professional learning of our staff and support for them I think is making a difference already but, importantly, will continue to make a difference. But I think it is really challenging to be able to say, 'Well, we spent this bit of money and it definitely led to that', because it's such a complex picture. And, again, what we do know from international best practice, what do we know that works in driving up standards, and then how can we align the money that we've got to supporting that? And, as I said, 50 per cent of that money has gone directly to simply supporting the professional learning of those who work with our children. We're going to talk now a bit about schools causing concern with questions from Huw Irranca-Davies. If I can, just first of all, zoom in on the way in which we actually decide which schools need what support. So, we've got the school categorisation system, which we're familiar with. We've also got Estyn inspection reports, then we've got other intelligence, including local intelligence on the ground. How do you decide from that? How is it decided what schools need support, need challenge? How do we do that? kirsty williams am: Well, you're right: what we have is a variety of ways in which we can identify schools that need support, or need to be challenged on their practice. So, our school improvement service\u2014it's a risk-based approach, so they can evaluate where they need to put their time, effort and resource. Sometimes, it's used by other people for other things, but that is not its primary purpose; its primary purpose there is not one of accountability, it is one of identifying risk and aligning that then to the support that is available. That is our method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they do. The elements that go into making that judgment around the levels of support have changed, and, of course, the Estyn inspection regime is also changing. huw irranca-davies am: And you've made, with feedback over the last few years, adjustments to the way that the categorisation system works. Are you content with where it is now, or do you see more adjustments being made? Have you got things in front of you that you're getting feedback on saying 'Well, we need to tweak this again a little bit'? kirsty williams am: So, that system has evolved over time. Initially, on coming into office, when I first came in, it was purely driven by data, and it was also done in quartiles. So, there was a certain number of schools that had to be in the bottom, which drove practitioners mad. They were like 'Ah, every year, there's going to be some of us that have to be in the bottom quartile', because of the way in which it was arranged, which seemed very unfair to them. It's not just purely driven on data now; there are other judgments\u2014the professional judgments of our challenge advisers are taken into account. And I would expect that situation to continue to evolve to align itself to our curriculum reform, and our changes in self-evaluation. I expect that that system will continue to evolve and change, so that it complements and assists in the reform journey as other parts of the system change. I think, for any impartial reader of the way that the trends have been going on this, there is some good news within that, in that, certainly, those schools that might have been identified as have been okay but coasting along, seem to be moving up the categories, although we still do have that\u2014. Well, it's what the system is there to do, it's to identify those schools that do need that additional support. And I like your analogy of a triage system\u2014'You're fit; keep on doing what you're doing and do it well; you need more support, we'll put the support in.' But, can I turn to those schools that are causing significant concern, and how we identify them? The Estyn chief inspector's conclusions at the end of the 2017-18 report that these schools are not being identified early enough\u2014there's a need to do something urgently about these concerns, particularly in secondary schools. Have we addressed that? Are you content that we've addressed that concern? Was he right? kirsty williams am: No, the chief inspector is absolutely right\u2014absolutely right. In some ways, when a school goes into special measures, in a way, that's a failure of the system, because that should have been identified sooner. huw irranca-davies am: So just to ask, bearing in mind the earlier discussion we were having, how is it that we don't identify those schools? kirsty williams am: That's it\u2014you're quite right. Undoubtedly, what categorisation has done is led to a greater understanding, I think, on behalf of local education authorities' and school improvement services' knowledge about their schools. But we are not there yet in terms of necessarily, then, moving those schools more quickly, once they've been identified as needing the highest level of support to see improvement. So you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve\u2014more and more and more of our primary schools are in a green rating, which is very satisfying to me. But we have got more of an issue with secondary schools, and we have a particular issue with the same schools being identified in that level of categorisation. So even though we've identified them as needing that extra help, they are not moving at pace away from that system. The first is, we are, again, looking at different sets of data that can give us even earlier warning systems that things are going wrong in a school\u2014and perhaps Steve will explain later. For instance, staff sickness, and carefully monitoring staff sickness, because there is a direct correlation between high levels of staff sickness in a school and what is going on in the school. And we have a new multi-agency approach, working with those schools to try and move them more forward. And that multi-agency panel includes the school itself, the local authority, the regional consortia school improvement staff, Estyn and Welsh Government\u2014as a multi-agency panel to support improvement in that school. So, for instance, what would normally happen, Estyn would come in, Estyn would make a judgment on the school\u2014requiring special measures or urgent improvement\u2014and Estyn would go away. They'd go away for six months, and then they'd come back in six months, and they'd make another judgment, 'No, still not good enough', and disappear for six months. We're saying\u2014Estyn and the Welsh Government have agreed that's not the best approach; Estyn need to be part of the solution, rather than just coming and making a judgment. Actually, we've had local authorities coming to us and saying, 'Can we put more schools in? Rather than just having two of our high schools, can we engage more in this project and this pilot?' It's being evaluated by Cardiff Metropolitan University and Swansea University, so we're having some academic overview to see, actually, does this approach work, can we evidence it\u2014that it actually makes a difference? And it's actually\u2014I'd like to claim all the credit for it, but it's actually not dissimilar to something that's happening in Scotland as well. But we knew that carrying on doing the same old thing clearly wasn't moving these schools, we needed a new approach, and this is what we're doing at the moment. Steve, I don't know\u2014 steve davies: I think your important point is about, 'What about the schools that are sliding in that direction?' And it's bringing together what we know from Estyn, but also, critically, local authorities have knowledge of their schools, and so do consortia. So, the Minister gave the example of staff sickness\u2014not always a trigger, but it's one of those. If you look at movement of pupils out of a school, you can look at complaints, you can look at, actually, emerging increased use of HR resources that a school pulls on a local authority. The point the Minister made about Estyn as well is, historically, when they go into special measures, Estyn, at the end of that week, call in, historically, either the region or the local authority, they will feed back to one of them, and then they go away. But, as the Minister said, we want to keep a very clear distinction between the accountability and the transparency to the public, to parents, with the very detailed collective work of that multi-agency group to actually make that difference over time. Does that deal with the issue of the schools that have been identified in those categories of requiring significant improvement and requiring special measures? Are those the ones that will be identified now, or is that above and beyond that again? kirsty williams am: Well, those are the ones that are primarily at the forefront of our minds, but this way of sharing data better, to step in earlier, is part of our attempt to address what the chief inspector says about stepping in early\u2014not waiting until a school gets into special measures and a formal judgment from Estyn of that, but actually using that intelligence to get support in there earlier. The three elements that that multi-agency approach look at are: what are the fundamentals that need addressing in this school? What is the capacity of the school itself to be able to address those fundamentals? And, what extra support needs to go into that senior management team and the governing body to get those fundamentals addressed? And actually, what does sustainable improvement look like? Because, again, one of the issues, sometimes, that happens is, a school goes into a category with Estyn, there's a big push and a big, 'We must do something' and the school comes out, but actually, that improvement is not sustainable. It's the low-hanging fruit; it's the easy wins that have been achieved, but actually, perhaps some of the fundamental challenges underlying in that school haven't been addressed in that process. So, this is about what will sustainable improvement look like in six months, what's it going to look like in 12 months and what's it going to look like in 18 months. So, actually, a more strategic, longer term approach to real change in a school rather than, perhaps, some of the easy-to-fix items that make a school as if it's doing better, but we really haven't tackled some of the underlying problems that make that school vulnerable to slipping back.",
        " Does that make sense? lynne neagle am: I've got a couple of supplementaries on\u2014. Sorry? kirsty williams am: Does that make sense? lynne neagle am: Yes. We've got a couple of supplementaries on this, first from Suzy and then from Si\u00e2n. Obviously, I'm pleased to hear that this work is being done, but I'm wondering\u2014. What strikes me, in the recent past, at least, particularly as we've got the usual suspects in this category\u2014. I've got to ask myself why it is that councils have been reluctant, perhaps, to step in with these schools earlier, particularly as they've got consortia or middle-tier support as well. Has there been a deficit in that space that has meant that councils don't feel equipped to step in? I just don't really get it why they've been reluctant to step in so far. If they've been nervous about doing it, because they don't feel that they've got the tools to do it, then I think that's pretty important, because as you were saying, we were talking about fundamentals; surely, councils have been able to deal with fundamentals, and more importantly, consortia up until now. Because, obviously, we're asking these players to give us evidence at some point, so perhaps I'd like to challenge them on how come we're here now. I see our job as corralling the collective effort, and I think, for too long in the system, there has been a lack of co-ordination. So, this is about bringing and corralling a collective effort to address this, going forward, in more sustainable way. And I think it does come back to this issue around self-evaluation and a willingness to be open, honest and upfront about some of the challenges that we've got. It's not easy, is it? It's not easy to accept or to acknowledge sometimes when things are\u2014 suzy davies am: That they don't know how to do this. kirsty williams am: Well, that they're going badly, or perhaps they don't know exactly how to make the difference. So this approach, as I said, is a new way of trying to coral that collective effort across the board. But, I don't know if Steve\u2014because you've done other roles in the system, so perhaps you've got a different insight. There are others that we're working with, and yes, at its best, it's done as a joint exercise where they use their regional school improvement service to help in the identification that there is a need for this.\u00a0They take advice as to what the action is, whether it is, as the Minister said, in the more significant areas, a board, or whether a warning notice comes in terms of standards or finance. So, we're working with them and we're working with the Welsh Local Government Association to share that practice. An example of that work is: we have done a development training session for cabinet members for education, and scrutiny leads for education across Wales, and all 22 local authorities came to that and engaged with that. That was partly about self-improvement, but it was also about where significant issues arise, you have to constructively confront them. And that comes with what the region knows, and increasingly, we're looking to have it consistently across 22 local authorities, so they are collecting all the additional data that we referred to earlier, so they can legitimately hold a mirror up and say, 'This is a real concern that we have. We're not punishing you, but we're registering the seriousness, and we want you to address it.' And we're making progress. I believe it's genuinely more consistent now, but I'd be lying if I said that there was consistency across all 22 local authorities. sian gwenllian am: Because you are moving to a more sophisticated approach in terms of identifying problems sooner, and so can offer the support earlier, is it time to think about moving away from the system of categorisation entirely? That is, has the categorisation system reached the end of its usefulness, and is the multi-agency approach, this more sophisticated approach, a better way, ultimately, of being able to assist schools in moving forward? kirsty williams am: I think, Si\u00e2n, as I said earlier, the categorisation system has evolved over time, and my expectation is that it will continue to evolve, because it has to be consistent with our overall approach to school improvement and raising standards. I expect OECD will have feedback for us on this important part of our system, and we'll wait to see exactly what they say about it, but as I said in answer to Huw Irranca-Davies earlier, I haven't got a closed mind; we've demonstrated over the last four years our willingness to change the system to make it a smarter system, and we will continue to keep that under review, as we move forward. If I could just go back briefly, it doesn't sound like a very exciting thing, does it, when we say we've been doing work with the WLGA, with cabinet members, but also scrutiny, because that's a really important part of the jigsaw as well, is actually local government scrutiny of the performance of your education portfolio holder and the leadership of your council. So this is about trying to up the ante on all sides, so that those issues around 'What are you doing in your local authority to use the powers that you have?' You know, sometimes, making sure that everybody in that authority\u2014those in power and those who are there to hold those in power to account\u2014have the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to do that appropriately. We've talked a lot about early identification; getting in there and then managing the improvement, this triage approach there, and then getting some grip of it, as well, in doing all of that. I won't touch on the primary schools, but let's just look at secondary schools\u201411 per cent of secondary schools inspected in the last two academic years judged as unsatisfactory, needing urgent improvement. There will always be secondary schools and primary schools that hit moments of crisis for one reason or another, but 11 per cent to me, and to any layperson, would seem unreasonably high. What is a level that you would be content with of having schools in red category in Wales? kirsty williams am: You're right. Schools will need different levels of support at different points, and sometimes, it's not because of a crisis. So, for instance, in my region, we do have an increase in the number of schools in the amber category. That's because we've seen in that particular region a number of headteachers retire because they've reached retirement age, and there are new headteachers. Nothing else has changed in that school, but the simple fact that you have a new leader, sometimes in those cases it might be their first headship. That means that that school is going to need a little bit of extra support, so it isn't always just a crisis that needs extra support, there are just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it. But you're absolutely right\u2014we have a particular challenge in the secondary sector where we have not been able to move individual schools forward at pace. And 11 per cent is not acceptable to me, Huw, which is why we have introduced this new pilot to address those schools where, persistently, we have concerns about their ability to move forward. If we'd have carried on doing the same thing, I suspect we would have just carried on getting the same result\u2014hence the need for a new approach to those schools that are causing concern. steve davies: Very briefly, the things we talked about earlier was how we measure the performance of schools, particularly at GCSEs, with a narrow focus. As was said earlier, some of these are the same groups\u2014they trip in and then they don't come out. Our belief is, from research, that they concentrate on squeezing the pips to get the grades up in some small areas for a period of time, and you can do that by targeting and immersing them. Estyn can tick the box to say your grades have got better, but we haven't handled the serious underpinning issues\u2014leadership, teaching and learning, and bringing those together. As the Minister said, what does sustainable improvement look like in six, 12, 18 months? It isn't just, as important as they are, getting those exam grades up a bit. And if they're all agreed as the indicators at the outset, we're more likely\u2014. So it's multi-agency; it's not a little activity, it's a major strategy. In 2016, your election manifesto very clearly said that you wanted to abolish regional consortia\u2014three words in it. Why haven't you done it? kirsty williams am: Because, given that you're such a keen student of my manifesto, you'll also know that\u2014 hefin david am: It was only three words. kirsty williams am: The Liberal Democrat manifesto also said that we supported major local government reform and a major reduction in the number of local government units. I have to say genuinely, my experience over the last four years has proven to me the value of regional working, and in the absence of significant local government reform, I think it's absolutely vital that we have scale in school improvement services\u2014scale that I don't think can be delivered across 22 individual local authorities. kirsty williams am: I think if there was significant local government reform and we could demonstrate that those units had such a scale that they could perform the functions of regional consortia, then I think it would be inevitable that any education Minister would look to see whether there was an opportunity to change structures. But in the absence of that, Hefin, I have been absolutely convinced whilst doing this job that you need larger units to be able to carry out successful school improvement work, and I think it would be reckless to advocate the system going back to school improvement being organised in 22 different ways. Do you think that the work of the four consortia has been consistent and effective? kirsty williams am: The school improvement services? hefin david am: The four consortia. kirsty williams am: I think, as with individual local education authorities, there are some regional consortia services that have performed really highly\u2014and that's not me saying that, that's Estyn, but gives us assurance around that\u2014and there are others that need to improve. I think the consortia themselves would admit that they, since their establishment, have found new ways of working. Increasingly, over recent years, we have seen those consortia working together on a national approach, but delivered on a regional basis. But we are constantly looking for optimum delivery from those particular organisations, but as I said, I think it would be absolutely reckless to go back to a situation where school improvement services were being delivered individually on 22 different bases. I'm happy to accept that you've changed your opinion there; that's no problem at all. But with regard to the four consortia, and we'll take Education through Regional Working as an example, it does things differently to the other three. Is that a cause for concern, or do you think that's entirely appropriate? kirsty williams am: Well, ERW does things differently, but then so does the Education Achievement Service. What I'm interested in is not necessarily how they are constituted and organised, I'm interested in the effectiveness of that organisation to deliver for children and for teachers. ERW has got particular challenges, and we continue to work with those in ERW to address those, but increasingly, as I said, what we are seeing the regional consortia do is develop a national approach to school improvement services but deliver that on a regional basis so that there is greater consistency in terms of delivery. hefin david am: Are you happy that, within the ERW area, local authorities employ their own improvement advisers, rather than doing it in the way that the others do? kirsty williams am: We have discussed this at length with them. My preference would be for school improvement officers to be employed in the centre, and we continue to have those discussions, but what's really important to understand is that the regional consortia are not a beast of the Government; they are a beast of the local authorities that have worked together to create a school improvement service that meets their needs. So we can't impose that solution, and we continue to discuss with ERW what is the optimal way, and they continue to discuss with their constituent local authorities about how that should be organised. hefin david am: Are you concerned that Neath Port Talbot have given notice that they want to withdraw from regional working? kirsty williams am: I think it's really disappointing that Neath Port Talbot have published that notice. What's important for me is to understand\u2014not for me, it will be important for Estyn. It will be really important for us to understand how Neath Port Talbot intend to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from ERW, especially at what is a very, very critical time. I would want to know from Neath Port Talbot how they are going to do that without being part of that organisation. And, of course, there's the added complexity that so much of our money is channelled through to schools via the regional consortia. So, I would want to understand from Neath Port Talbot how they're going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who are receiving their education in Neath Port Talbot are not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision. hefin david am: Do you feel that it's your role to intervene in that area and instruct Neath Port Talbot and ERW as to how they should resolve this issue? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said, I would be seeking assurances\u2014 hefin david am: What does that mean, though, 'seeking assurances'? kirsty williams am: Well, Neath Port Talbot would need to demonstrate to me how they're going to address these issues. If they're not part of ERW and their schools and their children are not going to be in receipt of the support from ERW, as I said, especially at this critical time, how are they intending to do that? I haven't seen those plans, but if they were to push forward and follow through on the notice, I would want to see them and I suspect Estyn would want to see them also. hefin david am: Okay, just last issue on that: you're just waiting to see what Neath Port Talbot do next, then. kirsty williams am: Well, we have written to Neath Port Talbot to ask them to demonstrate to us, if they were to pull out of ERW, how they're going to meet their functions. hefin david am: Steve, did you want to say something? steve davies: Obviously\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that point. Is that the current document? Are there plans to change or update it, or is that exactly where we stand? kirsty williams am: So, that is the current model. Some specific recommendations were put forward about additional services that could be organised on a regional basis; primarily, that is a specialist human resources resource. We know that, because of austerity in some local authorities, HR departments have been really stretched. So, a proposal was put forward to include specialist HR and governor support as part of the regional model. However, I must say, having presented that evidence, some of our local authorities, even though there wasn't a national agreement to put that into the national model, have pooled their resources, and those services are being delivered and supported on a regional basis. So, for instance, the Education Achievement Service now provide specialist HR resource, and EAS and Central South provide governor support. So, although we weren't successful in persuading local government to adopt a new national model, local authorities in those areas saw the value of moving that way. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, and perhaps I'll put this to Steve Davies, everything the Minister just said, and also the line in the document\u2014 'The implementation of this model will change over time'\u2014 is it time to go back to that document and review it from a procedural point of view? steve davies: I don't think it's necessarily timely to go back and have a complete review of it. But, certainly, we are in ongoing discussions with the Welsh Local Government Association, both in terms of work with local authorities, and the type of intervention in schools. As the Minister touched on earlier, there is some work to get consistency across the current area, particularly, as we just mentioned, in relation to ERW work. I think what is emerging, as the Minister said, is that there are two regions who have already made this shift to pool services. I think the two other regions are seeing and will see the benefits of that, and instead of forcing it through, we'd expect that to evolve. hefin david am: And Professor Dylan Jones's strategic delivery group seems to have had quite a warm welcome in the sector. I'm very grateful to Dylan for his hard work and his skill in chairing that group, and I think it's been welcomed by all, so that we can get that clarity and consistency about the roles and responsibilities of the individual partners and players in the middle tier. hefin david am: And when will the work be completed, and what will the outcomes be? kirsty williams am: Well, the group is currently engaging with Steve and other officials on agreeing a plan, but also, crucially, that plan is there to support the successful implementation of the curriculum, so that we're very clear about the roles and responsibilities in the middle tier in this crucial phase following the publication. The history of devolution is full of fantastic documents, and, shall I say, patchy implementation.\u00a0The work that has gone into that curriculum is too important for implementation to be left to chance. hefin david am: Yes, but I'm thinking that the strategic delivery is reviewing the role of the middle tier. So, you know, what do we expect to see from it, notwithstanding the kind of softly, softly approach that you've already talked about? steve davies: It was set up, actually, about 18 months ago\u2014just under. It was set up to build collective\u00a0efficacy, because what people out there are seeing is that there's a confusion of roles, in what the regions are doing, and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel. So, they've been looking at who is doing what for the last 18 months, and exploring and making some changes themselves. It's not just what they do with Government or what they do with each other; it's just happened that it's timely, because one of the key bits of feedback we believe we will get from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is we have had co-construction, we'd had collective effort, but we need to do more, particularly within the middle tier. This is not controlled by Government, it is arm's length from Government, and it's not their job to get it ready for the new curriculum\u2014that's a key part of it. It does feed back in to the Minister but there's no formal mechanism by which they have to report. What I'm about to say, I say it even though I'm a big localist: it all seems to be heading in one direction of a national service. Is the strategic group even thinking in these terms, obviously building in local accountability? But it'll just make it so much easier in terms of accountability and consistency to monitor what the middle tier does, if it's a national service, like the National Adoption Service. Local delivery, national service\u2014is it heading in that direction? kirsty williams am: That's not the intention of setting the group up. As Steve just said, I receive feedback from Dylan, because I meet Dylan in this particular capacity on a planned basis. He is there to give me advice on the middle tier, and to give me advice on what he thinks Welsh Government needs to do. sian gwenllian am: What I was going to raise has been answered already, that is that, from what I can see, the work that Professor Dylan Jones is doing has evolved somewhat. I felt that, originally, the idea was to look at the middle tier in terms of any kind of duplication that was happening, and where it was possible to tighten up the people going into schools from different directions. But it appears that it has evolved to be something that's much more than that, and that it is placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system. Is there a risk for them to lose focus in that sense? kirsty williams am: No, not at all. I think they are very, very clear around establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other, as to what they can expect from their partners in the middle tier. And absolutely, it is about making sure that there isn't duplication, that people aren't second-guessing each other's work, and there are clear demarcations about who does what in the system, and, as I said, knowing that you can rely on your colleague in the middle tier to do the bit that they are responsible for. We've got a lot of areas to cover so we are going to have to pick up our pace a bit. sian gwenllian am: Thinking about you as a Minister trying to see what the long-term trends are with regard to raising standards and improving educational attainment, is that difficult, because the performance measures have changed, haven't they?",
        " We can't compare like-for-like now, because of the changes that have been made in the way that performance is measured. So, to begin with, is that a challenge, to see whether progress has been made? And secondly, what evidence do you as Minister use to look at the long-term trends? kirsty williams am: The first thing to say, with regard to changes to performance measures\u2014you're right that change to those does make it, in some cases, more difficult to look at trends over a period of time. If we change a performance measure, it is done to ensure that it is in the best interests of learners. I understand that, for researchers and for opposition Members, even for Ministers, it would be simpler to have the same set of measures over a period of time. But if we know that those things are driving behaviours that are unhelpful to children, and not in the best interests of children, then we have to change them, even thought that then does create challenges in different areas. With regard to what do we look at, there are a number of ways that we gain data and look at data in the system: everything from the categorisation system we spoke of earlier, and trends in categorisation; we look at Estyn reports; we continue to look at examination results. But we're trying to develop a broader range of data and statistics that give us a whole picture of the education performance, rather than narrowing down on one simple indicator that tells you one thing but doesn't tell you everything. But I don't know, Steve, if there's anything further that you'd like to add. steve davies: It's going back to what the Member raised earlier, in terms of the range of things that you look at\u2014things that can make a difference. So, when Estyn review schools, or we're looking to develop national frameworks for things like mental health and well-being, which look to the practice that enables raising standards, it's collecting that information, both at a national level, through the annual review of Estyn, as well as our engagement with regions and local authorities. And, inevitably, we will use the Programme for International Student Assessment, and any other external assessments that come through organisations like the OECD. And even where we've changed the performance measures, we still have, at national level, the ongoing data. So, if you looked at level 2 plus, we believe it is important that children get five good GCSEs\u2014for higher education and for employment. So, we've not lost sight of those at a national level\u2014we're not using them as a narrow set of performance measures for individual schools. kirsty williams am: So, if we look at\u2014level 2 plus is a good example. We know that a relentless focus on that single measure, as a way of judging the system, leads to a set of behaviours in schools. It narrows the focus onto a certain part of the cohort, it narrows the curriculum, when we know that children\u2014 sian gwenllian am: I'm not challenging the fact that you've changed the performance measures\u2014I understand that, and having a broader way of looking is better in the long run. I'm just saying, because there's been this change, it makes it more of a challenge\u2014whilst accepting why you've made the changes, but it does present more of a challenge, presumably, because you have to look at more indicators, and take evidence from different places. But those changes are being made for the right reasons, as I said, whether that be at level 2 plus. I understand why perhaps a performance measure around English was introduced, but the effect of that was that significant numbers of children\u2014and, it must be said, usually children who are entitled to free school meals\u2014were suddenly not sitting English literature GCSE. We've changed that performance measure, and guess what? Last year, we saw a significant increase in the number of children that were sitting English literature GCSE. For standards of literacy and oracy, I think studying literature is really, really important, before we even get into the joy of introducing children to the written word and the love of reading. Yes, it causes challenges, but we're making those changes because we believe that they are in the best interest of children, and that has to trump ease of comparison. sian gwenllian am: Why have you decided to ask the consortia, Estyn and so on not to report on local data or regional level data? How do we then come to conclusions about what is working if it isn't presented on a local authority and regional basis? kirsty williams am: Well, I think the thing to say about the communications from\u00a0Welsh Government, Estyn, and the WLGA is it's not about not communicating the data, it's about challenging people on how that data should be used. So, the data is still available, but it's a challenge to them about how to use that data. So, for instance, when we're presenting data that compares local authority to local authority, you could have a local authority that says, 'There we go, I'm above the national average. I don't need to worry about the education in my local authority, because I'm above the average, or I'm better than my neighbour.' That doesn't necessarily mean that everything is right in your local education authority. So, actually, it's not about hiding data; it's about how you use the data appropriately. And sometimes, how we were presenting data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of their system. So, it's about how you use data, and that's what the communication from Welsh Government and the WLGA and Estyn was about: think very carefully about this data and what it's telling you about your system, and don't be lulled into a false sense of security that you may be doing brilliantly. Or, perhaps, looking at your data, you may think, 'Oh, my goodness me, we're not doing very well at all', but, actually, more careful consideration of that might show that your school's impact on those children is really, really a positive one. If anything, it's about more data and, crucially for me, it's about more intelligent use and interrogation of that data, about truly what it's telling you about your system. So, doesn't that contradict what you've been telling the consortia and everyone else? kirsty williams am: No, not at all. As I said, we're not in the business of trying to hide data\u2014I believe absolutely in full transparency. And in terms of level 2 data, I think I'm not moving away from the point that I think it's really important that more and more children get five really good GCSEs. steve davies: Can I, very briefly\u2014? We didn't just send a letter out collectively. We've now carried out training jointly with WLGA and Estyn on how to use that data. So, it's not just looking where your LA is; it's also not looking at whether your school's better than average for the authority. And it is well received, and it should broaden the approach of scrutiny committees to beyond what historically was, if I'm honest, looking at the league table for their authority or looking at the league table of local authorities. It's not that they shouldn't be looking at that, but they need to dig much, much deeper underneath it. I'm going to appeal for brief questions and brief answers so that we can cover the rest of the questions. What are they telling you about the success you've had in trying to avoid the bad behaviour?\u00a0Short answers. [Laughter.] I think it's inevitable: whatever kind of measures we put in place, people will look to maximise their success in those measures, and I don't think we'll ever come up with a system where those measures are absolutely perfect. What's really important to me is that we're really, really, really challenging schools to look at the performance of all of their children, rather than just at a very, very narrow cohort around those C/D boundaries, which we knew was detrimental, potentially, to more able and talented children and really pushing those Bs to As and those As to A*s, and children for whom actually just getting in to school on a daily basis is an achievement, and the school has done well to provide that. So, our new capped 9 makes sure that there is breadth across a range of subjects, rather than just focusing on a narrower and narrower bunch of subject opportunities for children, and our new third-third-third system enables schools to really look at their performance. So if their capped 9 score is high, what's driving that? Is it because the bottom third of the cohort is doing really well, and the impact on those children is above and beyond what could be expected, but actually, you're not doing very well for your more able and talented; you're not pushing them on? Alternatively, maybe your capped 9 score is because your MAT children are doing incredibly well, but actually, you're not really making the progress for the middle tier of those children. It allows us to have a greater focus on the performance of our FSM children\u2014where they really are within that system. And crucially for me, it looks at the impact for every child, because every child has to matter in the system, and what we had before was a narrowing of curriculum choice and a narrowing on a certain cohort of children. suzy davies am: So are the permanent measures likely to be pretty similar to what you've got now? Because the research\u2014I don't know if the research is complete yet. When will you be publishing the new permanent evaluation? kirsty williams am: Sue, you're right: they're interim measures at the moment, and we will need to make sure that the performance measures are aligned to the new curriculum. Because Wales's review of qualifications potentially has an impact on what those finally will look like, so that work is ongoing at the moment, and unless Steve can tell me off the top of his head when we expect that to be completed by, I will send you a note. It's what's wrapped around those interim measures that I touched on earlier: the other evidence that we bring to bear about the effectiveness of a school, but we do want to say to schools that on the whole, broadly speaking, the interim measures will carry on for two, three years. suzy davies am: Okay, and the reason I asked that is right at the beginning of this session, the Minister said to the Chair that this \u00a3100 million that's going into school improvements will be going into things that work. We need some evidence that the interim measures are going to work as well, so when are they going to be evaluated? steve davies: Well, we've only just used them for one year. steve davies: We've signalled that they're only going to be in place for three years. We are carrying out our own review of the impact of those and that's been built in, but I expect the OECD report\u2014because it is an extensive report\u2014to give us feedback on how those things are working now, and some steer, as they did with the last report, as to the direction we would want to go into. kirsty williams am: And what I'm also interested in is those performance management measures around schools. Yes, they're about outcomes for children, but actually are about a broader suite of behaviours within that school, so, yes, qualifications and grades are an important part of a performance measure, but actually, I have other expectations of schools, above and beyond simply qualifications. And so, we would want our permanent set of performance measures to look at a wider set of behaviours within a school, and I think because\u2014. Exams are important\u2014of course they are, qualifications are important\u2014but the way in which those schools achieve those results are also important. lynne neagle am: Would you anticipate that including well-being, then? suzy davies am: In a whole-school approach. kirsty williams am: I absolutely\u2014and we need to find a way\u00a0of how we can truly measure that. Sometimes, children's well-being is influenced by lots of things outside the control of a school. So, I don't want schools to be held accountable for things that they have no control over, because of the circumstances in which a child may be living. But, absolutely: well-being and how the culture of the school addresses well-being is really important to me. suzy davies am: How useful is PISA for you in helping school improvement? I know that it's not always the thing that you enjoy watching or looking out for. But, genuinely, how useful is it? kirsty williams am: It is one of a range of tools that we need to look at. PISA is one thing where there is a level of consistency, so it will continue to be, I think, an important part of how we test how our system is doing. suzy davies am: We know that you are a little bit encouraged, but we are not out of the woods yet. How confident are you that we are on track for meeting these targets that were set before your time, or do you think that having those targets is helpful? Is it setting up aspirations that are incapable of being met within a period of time? kirsty williams am: Well, those long-term targets of a score around 500 are part of 'Our National Mission', and we have to keep the pressure on to strive. If we look at reading scores for girls, we are almost there, but that just demonstrates what a journey we've got with our boys to address. For me, one of the ways in which we will reach those targets and achieve them is further progress on our more able and talented children. Although we are now performing at an OECD average, I will be the first person to admit that, although we have seen an improvement in the higher level skills of our more able and talented children, we do not perform at an OECD average with regard to those level 6 and level 5 scores. That's one of the reasons why we have introduced a more able and talented budget to support that, and our Seren programme, which is delivering fantastic results post-16. That's why we're introducing the principles of Seren earlier into children's careers, bringing it down from year 9 upwards, to be able to drive improvements. So, I think that that's the area that we are particularly keen to work on: making sure that more of our children perform at the OECD average at level 5 and level 6. We are working with southern Ireland, who have consistently done well with reading scores, to look to see what lessons we can learn to press on with there with reading. Does that mean that the focus will then drift slightly from maths, where there has been some success; and drift from science, where the encouragement of more people to take GCSE science has reduced the number of high-level passes? kirsty williams am: First, we have to have a system that is capable of doing all of those of things at the same time. We can't accept a system that says, 'Well, we can do a bit over here, but that means we have to\u2014.' We have to have a system, Suzy, that can drive improvements at all levels. As I've said, it's far from perfect, and we've got more work to do, but we have to deliver across all three domains, as we did last time. It was a travesty that there were children who never had the opportunity to sit a science GCSE. We don't have to make assumptions about the nature of many, many, many of those children. We have seen a significant increase in the number of children who are having the opportunity to sit GCSE science and who are passing GCSE science. One of the reasons that I suspect we have ended up with poor science scores is because of the previous policy around science entries and science qualifications. Again, one of the reasons that we have changed it isn't just solely because we need to do better in PISA, but I think that by changing it, we will see an impact on PISA. sian gwenllian am: I just want to discuss an issue that I know is important to you, namely closing the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not eligible for free school meals. We are not where we need to be in terms of the performance, not only of our children on free school meals, but the performance of our looked-after children, and the performance of some children from some ethnic minority groups. So, we will continue to look to support those learners in a variety of ways, again looking to amend our practice on the basis of evidence that is given to us from our experts who are there to advise us. There has been some progress in some areas, but it is not where I would want it to be. sian gwenllian am: But, this is despite the fact that there is \u00a3475 million that has been invested in the pupil development grant, for this exact purpose of closing the attainment gap. kirsty williams am: Well, I think that, as I said, I am not shying away from any assumption or declaration that we need to do better. If we go back to look at what PISA has said about our performance, the PISA results show that pupils in Wales are relatively more able to overcome the disadvantage of their background than is the average in OECD countries. If we look at pupils who are eligible for free school meals, they do score below their better-off counterparts in PISA by some 34 points. It's difficult to make comparisons because of all the reasons we have talked about, but if we look back to 2006 and we look at the very basic level of qualifications, which is a level 1 qualification, we have seen a jump from 9.4 per cent of children in 2006 achieving a level 1 qualification to over 18 per cent. We need to get this right for those children, the moment that they come into a nursery and the moment that they start their formal education at the age of 5. Providing catch-up, of course, we need to do for those kids; we can't throw those year 10s and year 11s to the wind. sian gwenllian am: But I'm sure that that is a disappointment to you, because it has been a personal priority for you as well. In terms of minority ethnic learners, while there are some groups within that category who are achieving, there is underachievement happening here as well, isn't there? It's not consistent across the minority ethnic group. Is that something that you will be focusing upon? kirsty williams am: Yes, and that's why we have committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant to local authorities of some \u00a310 million, to support education of our minority ethnic children. We need a much more sophisticated conversation about what is really going on in attainment across minority ethnic groups so that we can best target that resource and have a conversation about what the differences are. If we look at black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals, they perform almost at the national average for all children\u2014not FSM children; the national average for all children. So, there is a really complex picture here, and I really welcome a debate about acknowledging the various levels of performance of BAME children, and where the gaps in performance lie. I'm committed to continuing to support educational opportunities, and that's why have ring-fenced the minority ethnic achievement grant. lynne neagle am: Si\u00e2n, this will need to be the last question, I'm afraid. sian gwenllian am: Sorry? lynne neagle am: This is going to have to be the last question. In terms of looked-after children, which is one of the groups where attainment isn't where we would like it to be, there was some improvement in 2016 at key stage 4, but it has been disappointing. Do we know what's been happening in 2019? kirsty williams am: The 2019 data will be published next month, and there has been significant activity. You are right: in recent years, the data have been poor and not where we would want it to be. That's why we have had a reformed approach to PDG LAC; the employment of PDG LAC co-ordinators across the regions. We've identified new resource in the new financial year to test new approaches, so, for instance, virtual school approaches, where we know, in other systems, that has worked. But, we expect the next set of data around the performance of this particular group of learners in March. We have come to the end of our time, so can I thank you, Minister, and your official for attending this morning? We have had a wide-ranging and very detailed discussion that will be very useful for the committee. As usual, you will be sent a transcript following the meeting to check for accuracy, but thank you again, both of you, for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from ERW providing additional information following the evidence session on 16 January. Paper to note 2 is a letter from Central South Consortium, similarly providing additional information following the evidence session. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales regarding children's rights in Wales, following up on some additional information there. Paper to note 4 is a letter from Qualifications Wales, providing additional information following the annual report scrutiny session in January. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "phd a: Why is it so cold in here ? professor b: so , we haven't sent around the agenda . So , i  , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? postdoc g: I c I could talk about the meeting .  phd a: Well , I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed , but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker . professor b: OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now . You were gonna starting to say something ? postdoc g: Well , you you , already know about the meeting that 's coming up and I don't know if if this is appropriate for this . phd e: What meeting ? professor b: We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week postdoc g: OK . professor b: I think phd e: Who 's coming ? professor b: John Fiscus postdoc g: An - anything else , strike anybody ? phd a: we started running recognition on one conversation but it 's the r isn't working yet . phd e: Wha phd a: the main thing would be if anyone has , knowledge about ways to , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition , that would be helpful to know about . professor b: Yeah , so ,  phd e: What about , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? phd c: Yeah , we 're working more on it but , it 's not finished . postdoc g: I had thought under my topic that I would mention the , four items that I I , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting , which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans . professor b: Alright , why don't we start off with this , u u I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . So the one issue was that the the , lapel mike , isn't as good as you would like . Right ? phd a: Ri -  , professor b: Is that is that basically the point ? phd a: yeah , the And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,  or and even on prosody , which Don is gonna be working on soon , it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . phd a: So And I also talked to Mari this morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that . And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too . Right , so one th grad h: Well , so professor b: well one thing I was gonna say was that , i we could get more , of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of radio channels we have because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order . grad h: So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . grad h: And then just sort of about , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth . phd a: But we have more than one type of professor b: How am I d phd a: for instance , you 're phd c: Yeah . phd a: But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , as much as possible that would be really helpful . professor b: Well ,  it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , phd d: Yeah . professor b: so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of if this microphone seems OK to people , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . grad h: Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , some of the Jimlets aren't working . grad h: And so , w  , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working . phd e: Can we get these , wireless ? grad h: So professor b: No , but my point is phd a: But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting . professor b: R r right grad h: I I 'm not sure I 'm follow . Say that again ? professor b: Right now , we 've got , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard . professor b: Also what we 've talked before about getting another , radio , grad h: Right . professor b: So ,  so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do , but have them all be the same mike . I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , more uniformity , phd a: Right . phd a: Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n  , professor b: Yeah . phd e: Is it because You you 're saying the for dialogue purposes , so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? Is that what you mean ? phd a: Well Jane would know more about the transcribers . postdoc g: a couple times , so , yeah , the transcribers notice And in fact there 're some where ,  ugh well ,  there 's it 's the double thing . postdoc g: And he 's always they always they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's Adam 's channel is .  , \" Baaah ! \" phd a: Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w postdoc g: Yeah , but  it 's not just that , it 's also you know you professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: It 's also like n no breathing , no You know , it 's like it 's it 's  , professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view grad h: Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . professor b: When we 're doing grad h: Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . professor b: Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about and that grad h: Yep . postdoc g: And there was some talk about , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to grad h: Yep . So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible . grad h: And , you know , we 're researchers , so we all have big heads . OK , so , Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I 've spoken with , u u a lot of people here , not everyone .  , and , he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in , seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans , which I 'll mention in a second , and also , he was interested in the pre - segmentation and then he 's also interested in the transcription conventions . postdoc g: And ,  So , it seems to me in terms of like , i i it wou You know , OK . So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room and how it how the recordings are done , and that kind of thing . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , handle multi - channel recording . grad h: Oh , I should 've I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . I I , @ @ didn't didn't see it , yesterday but I 'm going to see it today . And , that 's that will enable us to do nice  , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments . In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that that continues to be , a terrific asset to the to the transcribers . What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , there 's some speech in . I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies ,  normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels . phd c: And so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's there 's speech in addition to to the thing we we did now which is just , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . So I 'm I 'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file postdoc g: This is good . phd c: but I 'm I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in in different channels . postdoc g: Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID potentially . professor b: something I guess I didn't put in the list but , on that , same day later on in or maybe it 's No , actually it 's this week , Dave Gelbart and I will be , visiting with John Canny who i you know , is a CS professor , postdoc g: Oh . You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things phd e: That would be cool . professor b: or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want phd d: Yeah . professor b: but they might wanna just , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them  , I also had a discussion So , w  , we 'll be over over there talking with him , after class on Friday . I had a , discussion today with , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , a German , scientist who 's got a fair sized group doing a range of things . But but , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , head models and microphone things . And so , he 's he and possibly a student , there w there 's , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , may come here , in the fall for , sort of a five month , sabbatical . phd e: That that reminds me , I had a a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here , either using , you know , the the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes , phd d:   phd e: and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , professor b: Right . phd e: And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who professor b: A little bit , phd e: and professor b: he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of phd d: Yeah , yeah . professor b: e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side , grad h:   professor b: if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a phd d: Yeah . professor b: if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . And if if someone 's talking on on on , one side or the other , it goes the other way . professor b: And then , it it it even looks different if th t if the two two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle . Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that  , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than your guys 's mikes . phd e: So if you just looked at grad h: Oh , that 's another cl cue , phd d: Yeah . phd e: yeah , looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . professor b: Yeah , well you have to the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and and and are probably the key . phd a: You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting . postdoc g: Can I ask one thing ?  , so , Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , microphone arrays . postdoc g: is there  b And I also want to say , his he can't stay all day . He needs to  , leave for  , from here to make a two forty - five flight grad h: Oh , so just morning . postdoc g: So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that ,  that , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . professor b: Probably not but I I 'll I 'll I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved . professor b: he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , or he might have no interest whatsoever . grad h: Is he involved in Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project . NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software . Is is he the one working on that ? professor b: Well that 's what they 're starting up . professor b: well I think they 've instrumented a room but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet . They don't have the phd e: Are they going to do video as well ? grad h:  . grad h: Oh , cuz what what I had read was , they had a  very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . professor b: All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . professor b: And one one notable difference u u actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not , but one one , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes . The reason I didn't go for that here was because , the focus , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was  , in impromptu situations . And we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it . professor b: And so , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , one or more other people i  , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be . And therefore it would not it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just phd e: So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? professor b: No . So there 's there 's  , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this . professor b: So , the ,  the big arrays , places , like  , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places , they have , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . professor b: And it 's and , in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff , but it d it d we ended up not doing it . grad h: And then they have little ones too professor b: And then they had the little ones , yeah . grad h: but  but they don't have our block of wood , right ? professor b: Yeah , our block of wood is unique . professor b: But the But the No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something phd a:   professor b: and and ,  So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . professor b: so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do .  , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask . Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask \"  , are you recording video ? \" phd a: Right , professor b: right ? phd a: right . professor b: And and the acoustic people will always say , \" well are you doing , array microphones ? \" So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .  , I know that having an array of  , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones . But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off  , channels when you 're later on ?  , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ? grad h: It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . professor b: Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the postdoc g: OK . professor b: But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction . grad h: That 's right ,  if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it , phd a: Right . That would be fine , phd e: So to save that data you You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? grad h: Buy more disk space . professor b: But then , you know , there 's it there 's phd e: What you save , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah professor b: There 's I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . grad h: Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . professor b: Right ? phd a: it seems professor b: So phd e: Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . phd a: it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this , just getting the data , because there 's a number of sites like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , but they 'll be recording with video and they 'll be You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , and just have this other information available . So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure and then , I don't know , save it out or have whoever 's interested save that data out , transfer it there , it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . grad h: You mean to to actually get a microphone array and do that ? phd a: Well , if Even if we 're not grad h: And video and phd a: I 'm not sure about video . That 's sort of an video has a little different nature since right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .  , but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then grad h: Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . professor b: See the problem is it it took , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes . And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily and , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort . professor b: But , e I think for  , how we 're gonna decide For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .  , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes .",
        " phd a: Well if there 's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these f those professor b: Yeah . phd a: So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data , who 's interested , and even if ICSI it itself isn't .  , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ? I don't know . phd a:  it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of grad h: And y it 'd certainly gets skew . phd a: once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data . I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , grad h: Just professor b: but the real issue is that , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . professor b: which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , phd a: I see . But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours which might be useful for for them . phd a: Right ,  at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts , professor b: And then we can offer up the room , phd a: and Right . professor b: Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . phd a: But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two , professor b: Well I thi phd a: so professor b: yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do . phd e: Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ?  professor b: Right , so we have we phd e:  grad h: Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , that you have an infrastructure problem , you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it . Internally , but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video . So it 's just postdoc g: Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video . There 's the fact that then  , if i I I 've heard comments about this before , \" why don't you just put on a video camera ? \" But you know , it 's sort of like saying , \"  , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things , but , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . \"  , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in . professor b: So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . postdoc g: I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ? grad h: Oh ! Probably not . postdoc g: A permission form ? grad h: Has Don have you s did you si I thought you did actually . grad h: Didn't you read a digit string ? phd e: You were here at a meeting before . postdoc g: Did you sign a form ? grad f: Did I ? I don't know . professor b: Yeah , we we postdoc g: But I just grad f: Can I verbally consent ? postdoc g: you know . You 're on recor you 're being recorded postdoc g: o grad f: Yeah . phd a: and professor b: we don't we don't perform electro - shock during these meetings , grad f: I don't care . phd e: How big is the data set ? postdoc g: Oh , it 's what  is one meeting . I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of of when to stop transcribing this one or So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose , and and and so phd e:  - huh . postdoc g: And , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases . So , you know , that means you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on  , right now all eight of them have differe  , additional data sets . postdoc g: And , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the ,  the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . But , just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .  , these still , when they 're finished , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . OK , now I wanted to mention the , teleconference I had with , Jonathan Fiscus . postdoc g: He , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been , looking , spending a lot of time with I 'm not quite sure the connection , but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system . But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach . postdoc g: So what he wants me to do and what we what we will do and  , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System . And they do have some sort of software , at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS and that he wants to experiment with taking our data and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . I I I explained to him in in detail the , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript . And , you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately and and the focus on reliability . He 's he 's very  , independently he asked , \" well what about reliability ? \" So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing . OK ,  phd a: Sorry , can you explain what the ATLAS I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system . postdoc g: Well , you know , at this point I think  , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this . But , there there is a way of viewing  , whenever you have coding categories , and you 're dealing with  , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , choices that you could use for each each of them . grad h: Is is Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ? I don't remember the acronym . The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . grad h: And that 's basically what I based the format that I did I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . phd e: Is this the project that 's sort of , between , NIST and and , a couple of other places ? postdoc g:   And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this , this , tree structure , annotated tree diagram thing . postdoc g: So ,  and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all . And , \" oh , and how 'd you handle this ? \" And I said , \" well , you know , this way \" and And and we had a really nice conversation .  , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury . I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , transcription . And what he said was that , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information . And , that 's ,  You know , I need to get back to him and and , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific , phd a:  . phd e: The p the people postdoc g: but I just haven't had time yet . phd e: The the folks that they 're , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters postdoc g: Sorry , what ? Yes . phd e: or postdoc g: Apparently Well , I get the sense they 're kind of like that . Like it 's like a pool of of somewhat  , secretarial I don't think that they 're court reporters . Like medical transcriptionist type people grad h: Nu - it 's mostly it 's for their speech recognition products , phd e: But aren't they 're postdoc g: Yep . grad h: Well they they do send it out but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . grad h: So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . postdoc g: Up to now it 's been monologues , as far my understood . postdoc g: Brian himself downloaded So So , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded  , cuz , you know , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do . postdoc g: And then what he 's going to do is check it , a before they go be beyond the first one . professor b: So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go phd e: OK . grad h: Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them . phd e: Well if you 're tran if you got that channel right there postdoc g: d  , in my case phd c: Yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah . phd a: I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files . phd a: there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . phd e: Yeah , that 's phd a: it sort of depends where you are in postdoc g: And especially since a lot of these phd d: Yeah . grad h: And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways . postdoc g: Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly grad h: So . postdoc g: unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix . In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel , grad h: Right . postdoc g: Yeah , well phd a: Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ? grad h: Right . phd a: In other words , if postdoc g: Well , I have to ask him . postdoc g: But but the ,  I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people , and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of So , you know , one of these people was was transcribing the , networks group talk and she said , \" I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , \" \" but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the that 's the convention and I just \" Cuz you know , if you don't know grad h: Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that . grad h: The networks group meetings are all phd e: Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? Why not just do it all ourselves ? professor b: it 's historical .  , some point ago we thought that  , it \" boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that \" , phd c:  - huh . phd d: No , just professor b: you know , like we just did , and , here 's , a a , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . professor b: And it still might be a good thing phd e: I 'm just wondering now phd a: Actu yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of professor b: but phd e: Well , I 'm I 'm wondering now if it 's grad h: Well we can talk about more details later . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , you know , have some more discussions with them . It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . grad h: So , Liz , with with the SRI recognizer , can it make use of some time marks ? phd a: OK , so this is a , grad h: I I guess I don't know what that means . phd a: and actually I should say this is what Don has b  , he 's already been really helpful in , chopping up these So so first of all you  , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .  , but second of all ,  in general because some of these channels , I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are have a lot of cross - ta sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .  , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition , especially forced alignment . So , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed which we did have some problems with , and Thilo , I think told me why this was , but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning , so the SRI re phd c: No , th Yeah . They they were not switching them but what they were they were adjusting them , phd a: and they They were not phd c: so . phd a: So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments . phd a: So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , cuts that you made on the mixed signal . Right ? phd a: the problem is if we have no time marks , then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . And so grad h: Oh , I see , phd a: if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , you know , par paragraph of of talk , grad h: it 's for the length . phd a: And , I think with phd e: Well you would need to like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , right ? phd a: No , we used the fact that So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this , whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , grad h: It 's already chunked . And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . That 's great , cuz the recognizer can grad h: it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also . phd a: Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think . phd a: Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to . phd e: Why not do a a a forced alignment ? grad h: That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . phd a: If you do a forced alignment on something really grad h: Got  six sixty minutes of phd a: well even if you do it on something really long you need to know you can always chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , chop . postdoc g: Now wasn't I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment , phd a: So postdoc g: after they grad h: Yeah , but professor b: I I think that they are , grad h: We 'll have to talk to Brian . professor b: yeah , I 'm sure they will and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it . professor b: it sounds like Liz has some concerns phd a: Maybe they have some you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers professor b: and phd a: I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . postdoc g: I just you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing . But the it is true that the segments I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you but the segments that in your first meeting are great . phd a: Right , cuz postdoc g: Well , I I was thinking it would be fun to to  , if if you wouldn't mind , to give us a pre - segmentation . postdoc g: maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that  , the first transcribed meeting , the one that I transcribed . phd c: I 'm sure I have some postdoc g: Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ? grad h: February sixteenth I think . phd c: but but that 's the one where we 're , trai training on , so that 's a little bit grad h: Oh . phd c: It 's a little bit at odd to postdoc g: Oh , darn . phd a: And actually as you get transcripts just , for new meetings , we can try postdoc g:  - huh . So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of  , parameters f on the recognizer , postdoc g:   phd a: The first meeting had I think just four people , phd c: Four speakers , yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you . I guess the other thing , I I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , I know you and I talked about this a little bit , there was an issue of , suppose we get in the , I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , where we we , we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were we 're the we 're still a bit slow on feeding at that point we 've caught up and the the the , the weak link is is recording meetings . OK , two questions come , is you know what how how do we  , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? And the other one is , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? So , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was grad h: We had spoken with them about it . postdoc g: And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , Dave finishes the and maybe it 's already finished the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .  , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . It 's just a matter of , you know , providing So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the  , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment . professor b: One one was  , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings , postdoc g: Yeah . The types of overlaps professor b: types of overlaps , and so forth that that someone could do . And the third one is is , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have which is that , if ,  if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . For instance , marking in some overlapping potentially overlapping fashion , the value of , ar articulatory features . professor b: You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth .",
        "  , as opposed to doing phonetic  , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , grad h:  professor b: and , assuming , articulatory feature values for those those things . postdoc g: Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels , wouldn't it ?  , I would think that that , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . professor b: but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone postdoc g:   grad h: Yeah , but but just saying what the professor b: because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here postdoc g: Yeah , I 'm sure . professor b: and and and it 's so I phd e: You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom - up . Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , phd e:   professor b: and  , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to postdoc g: That 's nice . professor b: some sort of categories but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just \" click , you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound \" and so on . phd a: So this is like gestural  , these g professor b: Yeah , something like that . professor b: actually if we get into that it might be good to , haul John Ohala into this phd a: Right . phd a: But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data , postdoc g: Excellent . phd a: like so that you can do far field studies of those gestures or  , or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ? Or ? professor b: No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally . And then you have i and then and then it 's natural in all senses , phd e: Just a source of data ? phd a: I see . professor b: in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know , one might have , and you have the close mikes , and you have people talking naturally . And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , phd a:  - huh . professor b: right ? So so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , phd d: Yeah . professor b: if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus  , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , censored choices , we don't have the video , we don't and so forth , but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . professor b: And , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . professor b: people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT and ,  w due to its markings , and then the Switchboard transcription thing , well I think has been very useful for a lot of people . professor b: So phd a: I guess I wanted to , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings . phd a: I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , \" well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow professor b: Yeah . Go to their meeting tomorrow and see if we can try , to convince them postdoc g:   professor b: Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , phd a: because they have And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here professor b: right ? postdoc g:    phd e: You mean in terms of the topic topics ? phd a: Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things and , just dialogue - wise , professor b:   And then the other thing is , I don't know if this is at all useful , but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch , professor b: Yes . grad h: You mean non - ICSI ? phd a: non - ICSI , non - academic , grad h: Yeah , I guess you you can try phd a: you know , like government people , grad h: but phd a: I don't know .  , it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches grad h: Well , tha I think that 's her point . phd a: Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings postdoc g: Yeah . phd e: Does does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? postdoc g:   grad h: And I think , if we could get phd a: So I actually wrote to him and he answered , \" great , that sounds really interesting \" . grad h: But , it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording phd a: So grad h: so u I didn't have to do it each time . phd a: and I was thinking professor b: He - he 's supposed he 's supposed to be trained to do it .  , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging , grad h: It 's not that hard . phd a: disfluency tagging , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling . So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , \" well \" , and that \" well \" is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .  , and things like that , th postdoc g: Of course some of that can be li done lexically . phd a: A lot of it can be done postdoc g: And I also they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already . phd a: I think there 's a second pass and I don't really know what would exist in it . But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not , postdoc g:   postdoc g: I wanted to whi while we 're  , so , to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data ,  I have two questions . One of them is , Jerry Feldman 's group , they they , are they I know that they recorded one meeting . professor b: I think there 's we should go beyond , ICSI but , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group but even there he hadn't What he 'd said \" no \" to was for the main meeting . phd e: Well , and and the other thing too is when they originally said \" no \" they didn't know about this post - editing capability thing . professor b: there 's there 's , the networks group , I don't Do they still meeting regularly or ? grad h: Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not but they are no longer recording . professor b: But  , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore or ? grad h: ugh , what was his name ? professor b: i i postdoc g: Joe Sokol ? grad h: Yeah . professor b: OK , so they 're down to three or four people grad h: They and they stopped Yeah . postdoc g: We might be able to get the administration grad h: Well he was sort of my contact , so I just need to find out who 's running it now . phd a: Yeah , it One thing that would be nice postdoc g: I don't know phd a: and this it sounds bizarre but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion , like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that . Some group , \" yes , we must \" grad h: Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? phd a: Well , you know , something phd c: Yeah . grad f: Yeah , I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to phd a:  professor b: Yeah , with with with potential use from the defense department . phd a: No , but maybe stu student , groups or , film - makers , or som Something a little bit colorful . Yeah , th there 's a problem there in terms of , the  commercial value of of st  , postdoc g: Yeah , of course there is this problem though , that if we give them the chance to excise later we e might end up with like five minutes out of a f of m one hour phd d: Film - maker . phd a: And I don't mean that they 're angry phd d: Is postdoc g: of Yes . phd a: but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat . So if anyone has ideas , I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing . postdoc g: Well there was this K P F A grad h: No that 's postdoc g: but OK . phd a: Or postdoc g: And I had one other one other aspect of this which is , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar  y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers . phd e: Did he mean ,  did he mean and non - British ? grad h: Well phd c: The all native . phd e: He said British was OK ? postdoc g: But but Sure , sure , sure . professor b: Why ? grad h: British is English ? phd c:  postdoc g: Yeah . professor b: Well , I don't I don't I don't think if he didn't say that postdoc g: Native speaking . grad h: So , why would he care ? phd e: Knowing the application phd a: That 's professor b: I remember wh I I remember a study phd a: I was thinking , knowing the , n National Institute of Standards , it is all professor b: I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on this was in Wall Street Journal days or something , they trained on American English and then they tested on , different native speakers from different areas . professor b: it was Swiss w Yeah , so it 's so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want ,  American English , postdoc g: All America , OK . It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of postdoc g: I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way , aren't they ?  , I sort of feel like they have professor b: I think so , grad h: Maybe . grad h: And maybe there are a few of with us where it was professor b: Yeah . grad h: you know , Dan wasn't there and before Jose started coming , professor b: Yeah . professor b: So , what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? phd d: Yeah . phd a: Exactly , that 's what I was professor b: You 'd think like they would be phd d: A film - maker . phd a: something where there there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing . phd a: Yeah , we could phd e: A any department that calls itself science phd d: Department . phd d: Computer sci grad h: That postdoc g: We could get Julia Child . phd a: I 'm I 'm actually serious grad h: That 's phd a: because , you know , we have the set up here grad h: Got a ticket . grad f: I know grad h: I could phd a: Not not professor b: Put a little ad up saying , \" come here and argue \" . grad h: and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . grad h: But when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff , so . phd a: Or people who are really h professor b: They could have a discussion about te grad f: I grad h: We should probably bleep that out . grad f: I heard that at Cal Tech they have a special room someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out that you can go to and like throw things and break things . professor b: Yeah , now that is not actually what we grad f: So we can like post a grad h: Th - that 's not what we want . grad f: No , not to that extent phd a: Well , far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall . professor b: Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . postdoc g: It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the grad h: There was a dorm room at Tech that , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , the floor with mattresses . professor b: What did we mean by that ? Remember @ @ ? grad h: Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . phd a: Well I think that that was just sort of I I already asked Thilo professor b: Oh , you already did that . phd a: but that , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , people who are doing any kind of post - processing , whether it 's to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition .  , so , i is that Who else is work I guess Dan Ellis and you phd c: Dan , yeah . professor b: he 's he 's interested in in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . professor b: Which  grad h: I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes , professor b:  ? grad h: but who knows ? professor b: Well , let 's w i isn't that what what you want phd a: I don't know . I 'm bad professor b: t No , so No , i w wha what you what you want when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . professor b: And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by ,  by any room acoustics or is it just  , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? phd a: It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear professor b:  phd a: but I 'm not an expert . grad h: e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , room acoustic phd a: That that may be true . phd a: But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods grad h: Yeah . grad h: So I I think it 's just , phd a: Oh , I don't know . phd a: All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , techniques . phd e: So the problem is like , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people and that 's causing problems ? phd a: R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K because the t no one transcribed any words there and we throw it out . phd a: But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time , so you get some speech and then a \"  -  \" , and some more speech , so that whole thing is one chunk . And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , that 's where it 's a big problem . postdoc g: You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well , the encoding of the phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: And and he also , he was phd a: The energy , phd d: Yeah , phd a: right . postdoc g: I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events . Because , eh , it 's possible , eh , eh , in a simp sample view , to , nnn , to compare with c with the segment , the the kind of assessment what happened with the the different parameters . And only with a different bands of color for the , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ . phd d: I I I see that , eh , you are considering now , eh , a very sophisticated , eh , ehm , eh , @ @ set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si symbols to to transcribe . No ? Because , before , you you are talking about the the possibility to include in the Transcriber program eh , a set of symbols , of graphic symbol to t to mark the different situations during the transcription postdoc g: Oh , I w  - huh . No ? postdoc g: Well , you 're saying So , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and and and slam the door and stuff ? phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: Or some other kind of thing ? phd d: No ? To to mark postdoc g: Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much . The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c  , time things . postdoc g: But I I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you phd a:  . postdoc g: which is that it sounded to me , Liz , as though you and , maybe I didn't q understand this , but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together . postdoc g: And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker , phd a:   postdoc g: and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer . Is that right ? phd a: Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , postdoc g:   phd a: because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . phd a: And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .  , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio , postdoc g:   phd a: which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel , or to have very to have closer , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech that gets transcribed in it , or both . So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good . And then the issue of like global processing of some signal and then , you know , before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that . You can ,   The problem is just that the acoustic when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , you you 'll get , a  an alignment with the wrong duration pattern or it phd e: Oh , so that 's the problem , is the the signal - to - noise ratio . It 's not the fact that you have like  , what he did is allow you to have , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations . phd a: Right , things things near the boundaries where if you got your alignment wrong phd e:   It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word . So , yeah , bottom bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , detecting energies , phd d: Yeah . professor b: O K ,  tea has started out there I suggest we c run through our digits and , postdoc g: OK "

        "industrial designer: How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? project manager:  well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . user interface: You have the same message of  Windows cannot  marketing: user interface: sen oh stand-by . user interface: project manager:  I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it .  Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here  in the role of Industrial Designer . project manager:  we're going to do    a little tool training  for the tools we are going to use  during  the meetings we are going to have here .  then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,  and we will have a discussion .  is there any room for a little presentation ?  maybe during the discussion  section ? project manager: There is ? Yeah , there is . user interface: project manager:  okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop ,  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Those are kind of easy    goals ,  and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop .  we will discuss  later on more ideas about  how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .  we are going to use a a pred a project method  during  this development ,  which consists of three different design stages .  the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,  all of these stages   mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then  meet to discuss our   the the the progressions , yes . project manager:  the first stage , the functional design  we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will  make a specific  specification of that .  the second is the technical functional design ,  what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .  to  presentate , to show us  a file you'll need to  place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . project manager: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the  to the end .  you can insert a new  slide or or white-board   file  by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . user interface: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? project manager: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .  to  oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents  should be in the project documents folder if you want to  discuss it with us .  as a little training  I will ask Ruud first to draw   your own animal on a new slide  with  a different colour and a different line width than the one  now selected . marketing: project manager:  Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , industrial designer: Well , I'll give it a try . user interface: project manager: Okay , so  you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .  user interface: industrial designer: marketing: project manager: we  we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold  , if there is market  interest ,  in in more than one country . And  the production costs should not be more than  twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by  w w during the development ,  because  , well , those are important numbers . industrial designer: Yes ,  I have some technical  issues which I would like to present to you  before we start the discussion , because  there might be some  project manager: Limitations . I would like to think about  the implementation of  of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with  ideas ,  I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but  there might be some impossibilities .  and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . industrial designer: I have some  initial ideas about some things  which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming  discussion . user interface: And for a cell phone ? industrial designer: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . We're not  living in the  nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not  project manager: industrial designer: is not really  hot  technical stuff anymore . user interface: But Yeah , but the infrared , it's  , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . user interface: But all the T_V_s are  equipped with infrared , so industrial designer: But it's cost-effective . user interface: Or you shou sh use a industrial designer: So marketing: user interface: you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . So that's just my role , I'll just  give you  everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what  the product should be and how it should look , project manager: Yeah . project manager: Okay , so the the main por  the main points you are  telling us are focus on the inter  operability , industrial designer: Yes , project manager: and industrial designer: so one thing  one remote control should  control one or more  pieces of equipment , project manager: Okay , and and  industrial designer: and the way of communicating with these equipments .  there are other things like  how to make it trendy , which is I think   most  Ru  Ruud's  role . project manager: H how do you think the remote should  function for the user ? user interface: Well , I had a few  things in mind .  well , the interoperability , just like  Sebastian said ,  the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different   Yeah  , what is it , devices ? project manager: Yep . user interface:  so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in  a store . user interface: It's not for  for  for  Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager: Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , user interface: right ? project manager: not we're we're it's not a user interface: Yeah , I do I don't know that . industrial designer: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? project manager: No . industrial designer: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad  public , so it should fit to every device . project manager:  Ruud , y do you agree ? marketing: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . user interface:  Well , the techni fu technical function  what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . user interface: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task  as an  as an  device .  but furthermore industrial designer: And you you see  the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Or are there any o other controls ? user interface: Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or industrial designer: Are there only any other cont Well , user interface: But industrial designer: I I've seen these remote controls with  this little stick  which you can move forward , sidewords . And  it's very easy for a user to to switch user interface: They're very vu vulnerable . industrial designer: to to switch b  between  channels or  change  between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player .  point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should  maybe  be restriction to that . project manager:  industrial designer:  is that  are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device  the range is very limited . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer: user interface: but if you want to  get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one  speaker , then maybe the range should be  industrial designer: project manager: Okay , gentlemen ,   just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting industrial designer: Okay . user interface:  You should able to feel the buttons without  it mis  you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface  for feeling should be  good to understand . user interface: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al  in dark too . user interface: So when it's dark project manager: user interface: Those are two really  user interface project manager:  I'll write down glow in the dark . industrial designer: Do do you project manager:  do you have anything already w  ab idea about how the market  will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take  in account when developing such a product ? marketing:  I think most most things have already been said , like  control multiple devices . project manager: Because ? marketing:  well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? industrial designer:  well yes , I had ,  about three minutes ago , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: but I've seem to forget them forgot them . industrial designer:   would it be nice for a user to have display on this  remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Well , maybe I  but it it can be quite simple , industrial designer: I I don't know . project manager: Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . project manager: Yeah , industrial designer: Well , that's more project manager: twelve Euro fifty , yeah . I think the the financial part of this project  implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . project manager: So  maybe we could  for example  only light the buttons that are   applicable at that moment or user interface: But  Necessary , yeah . user interface: 'Cause I think Bluetooth  industrial designer: It's use  a lot of  project manager: Well does it ? user interface: Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .  industrial designer: Well , cell phones have  integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work  quite okay . user interface: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .  next meeting starts in thirty minutes and  , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it "

        "project manager: How do we sta wa how do we start ? Does anybody know ? marketing: Oh , another one . project manager: I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . project manager: So is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . project manager: Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . So are we supposed to bring the little things for the project manager: Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip marketing: project manager: do you have a belt ? industrial designer:  . So my favourite animal project manager: Yeah , what's your favourite animal ? industrial designer: 'Kay  marketing: Ah . project manager: 'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal . project manager: Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ? industrial designer: Okay . project manager: And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? user interface: Aesthetic yep , sure . Can I just draw the face ? project manager:  yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . project manager: Okay , do y do you wanna do some write marketing: Why ? project manager: you wanna just write some words about it ? marketing: Because  cuddly . And they can feel when a human's got problems so project manager: Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . project manager: but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little marketing: industrial designer: Oh that's a project manager: no user interface: industrial designer: user interface: A prairie dog ? project manager: no  user interface: Oh a squirrel ? project manager: That's exactly what it is . project manager: Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . user interface: So I think before we close  , we are expected  the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . user interface: Yeah , I think we're  before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for project manager: Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or user interface: Yeah . project manager: I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but user interface: Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . industrial designer: Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? marketing: Yeah . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and marketing: Medium . Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , you want you want one remote that maybe can work  all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , project manager: Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . user interface: but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . project manager: 'Cause I I  I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , marketing: project manager: but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . industrial designer: But how do we know how much  , how much do we have per how much ? marketing: Twelve fifty . industrial designer: So do we have to be realistic within the budget or project manager: Well at the moment we could , wa  we industrial designer: Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . marketing: Guess project manager: 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . marketing: Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? Like so you have one in like  industrial designer: Yeah . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and  into one basically . industrial designer:  have  one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one  a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . user interface: I'm not sure if that's like industrial designer: Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button . user interface: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . industrial designer: No , but you would slide it into  someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but user interface: Oh . project manager: F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . user interface: I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have .  so  we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , be able to operate project manager: Yeah . project manager: I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that  we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . project manager: What do you reckon ? See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be  project manager: I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . user interface: have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , project manager: Yeah . user interface:  simple to use , and looks decent and project manager: May w you know , maybe even marketing: But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? project manager: Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people marketing:  if it's if it's just like project manager: or so people that  b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for user interface: Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , project manager: Yeah . Yeah , rathe rather than focus on project manager: Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should user interface: Y Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r user interface: Yeah .  obviously everyone we're  you know  sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's user interface: Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . industrial designer: marketing: I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . project manager: Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah . user interface: Yeah , that's true what you were saying ,  it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not  not usable when you don't want it to be usable . marketing: project manager: so we've got some ideas , we've got  user interface: I guess that's good good for now . marketing: W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? project manager: Industrial Designer  which is marketing: Ah ri okay . project manager: that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . project manager: Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so ,  whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . Har how it works an project manager: And in marketing industrial designer: Bu marketing: These are requirement specification . marketing: So what the user requires project manager: Yeah , what industrial designer: Do you think our two kind of overlap , because marketing: in a remote . project manager: You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together . project manager: You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: So , do we take these off ? industrial designer: I don't {disfmarker}"

        " we will start with the  Manager Expert wi who will talk about  user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . marketing: Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted  into  what users want in this remote control . Oh that's okay , it's jus marketing:  so first of all we what we did is we  conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects .  we put them in a in our  usability laboratory and got them to , you know ,  play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire  to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . So basically  the major things we found out was that  basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .  they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we  did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .  they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ .  and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we  tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that  are on remote controls .  so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics  based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .  and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , while the user's watching T_V_ . industrial designer: project manager: marketing:  the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button ,  which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , all the other , all the other  buttons , such as ch  audio and picture selection  configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour .  we also asked users  which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,  note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance .  and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that  w the audio and picture settings were very  weren't very important to them  , and they used them very infrequently a as well . And fifty percent of the users said that  what frustrates them is losing the remote control  somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .  they also said that it  it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface .  and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and  cause u repetitive strain injury . We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition  is a useful feature to have on a remote control . project manager: marketing:  basically our findings are that  amongst a younger age groups  the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . industrial designer: marketing:  for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . Whereas  the the trend was as users as users  became older and older  they were less likely to want these sort of features in a  in a remote control .  and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics ,  I think we're focusing on the younger younger  target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . project manager: So ,  maybe now we can talk about a user interface and  about the technical function of this device . So  Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? industrial designer: Well , okay , yeah . marketing: Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , industrial designer: marketing: so it's industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . Okay , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for  , for sending some commands by some waves to  another device to to tell different commands  with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .  first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits  making interface with  keyboard and  r reading  keyboard and reading the keyboard  commands . And then there should be  an electronic circuit making  electronic signals according to these commands and  finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making  making  waves to transmit through the air and   this air this  wave  will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to  r to realise the command . Okay ,  about what I found about  different  these different blocks are  , usually there are two different methods  to for designing a remote control . This is  this can be   the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . And  also as  I understood , and  I think it was a part of  Bob ,   presentation , people prefer to have  to have  the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having  some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the  on the remote control . And  personal preferences ,     certainly a remote control with  working with radio waves is  preferred because  you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . marketing: Do you think radio waves  will interfere with other appliances in the home ? user interface: I don't think so , because  we can make  we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . project manager: So can we use any any frequency ? industrial designer: Yeah , it should be okay . project manager: We have the right to use any frequency ? user interface:  no but as I know , there is a range for  for this  f for for  for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our  transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . And what happen with  radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ? user interface:  for this I'm not  I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting  p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it project manager: Okay . A kind of identification , user interface: Yeah , identification code inside the industrial designer: Yeah f  I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . So industrial designer: It's  kind of handshaking , when starting to  when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . So industrial designer: So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . A specific  remote control has a specific f industrial designer: Yeah but we we don't have to think  about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made  circuits which we probably bu buy . I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this   in this company .  what  I have to do ? A look at what the other company Okay so  presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because  I didn't work  with these  circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And  I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them .  , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but  so far I I was  looking what what are the blue circuit ,  radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , marketing: So , I know that  the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can  you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , user interface: industrial designer: but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the  infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends  on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , user interface: industrial designer: because the speech rec Yeah ? marketing: Are we  are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? industrial designer: No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , project manager: industrial designer: so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . industrial designer: But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? industrial designer: Yeah , I'm project manager: Or it would be maybe feasible ? industrial designer: Oh . But if we use the L_C_D_  even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and  related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . industrial designer: It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , project manager:  . industrial designer: I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know ,  want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . And  my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view  of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . project manager: Why ? Because it's simpler ? industrial designer: Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . industrial designer: Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . marketing: What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ? project manager: industrial designer: Well , three to three to five . marketing: Or ten times more expensive ? Or industrial designer: N not ten times , marketing: Okay . marketing: because  all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . project manager: Well I , oh industrial designer: Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . project manager: we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . marketing: But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . project manager: So  I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . And  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .  the second thing is  they suggest that that we should  use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and  because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control .  ,  It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is  , we put fashion of in electronics . So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . So ,  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this  on this remote control . industrial designer: Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . project manager: Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? industrial designer: You should probably speak . Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?  those nine plus one or two ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: I think it would be a b industrial designer: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . project manager: On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's marketing: Yeah , I user interface: Yeah . project manager: Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like user interface: Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . project manager:  industrial designer: Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . Maybe we could have key buttons , like  discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and industrial designer: You mean like hierarchical structure . project manager: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . industrial designer: So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you project manager: Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . marketing: We could maybe also c  incorporate Petre's idea of the  slider for the volume , with the channel . industrial designer: So we are still s speaking about the common devices user interface: industrial designer: or we are inviting the new one ? marketing: I think so . project manager: What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . user interface: we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this    ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can industrial designer: On the screen , you mean ? user interface: Yeah . user interface: And then marketing: I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones .  this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ user interface: W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . industrial designer: Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . project manager: So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but user interface: Yeah . marketing: But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . marketing:  there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some project manager: Yeah . marketing: So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . project manager: In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . industrial designer: Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally project manager: It's it's a kind of setting , I think . marketing: well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . project manager: No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer industrial designer: Yes . Well I I  project manager: I I think , no ? industrial designer: marketing: But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute industrial designer: project manager: industrial designer: You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . marketing:  based on our usability studies again ,  pe  people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . marketing: you know , it was nine out of ten industrial designer: Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep  keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , marketing: re relevance . industrial designer: we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: Because , well it's maybe question for you t marketing: I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , user interface: marketing: which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . marketing:  and all the other f functionality is industrial designer: user interface: Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . industrial designer: Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . user interface: industrial designer: Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be project manager: For what ? industrial designer:  power button . marketing: I think it should be a bu industrial designer: If it if it's a button or user interface: Yeah . marketing: S What about things like the clock and  timers ? industrial designer: Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder . Well what w what was the question ? user interface: Clock or marketing: you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display project manager: Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . industrial designer: Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: no ? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ?  , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? user interface:  . project manager: W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . industrial designer: Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , user interface: project manager: industrial designer: well And based on your user interface: marketing: Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . industrial designer: marketing: But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but user interface:  . industrial designer: Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . industrial designer: user interface: And  do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? industrial designer: Yes yes . project manager: I think user interface: I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to  put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . project manager: So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time "

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ?

        "project manager: Hello ,  this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . project manager:  the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but  in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . So ,  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and  I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .  so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from  looking at   some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .  so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel ,  as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .  and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the  is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan ,  we've discovered that this year  fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . marketing:  so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy ,  has lots of technolog tech technology in it . user interface: marketing: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . marketing: So  fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , project manager: Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think  I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it  later .  generally , generally  this remote control   should be should be something , in my opinion ,  the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position   inside the remote control . And  s  I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and  start reading and  learning how to use this  this  remote control . So what I found out that  as I said  I think it's better to put  more frequent    ke  buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . user interface: And maybe  just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And  also f   m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not  consume lots of energy . And my personal p  preference is  , as I said ,  just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used  that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or  number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put  volume change or s ch can  channel change buttons   in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task  he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . And also  I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . For example , a sliding or rolling   d  stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with  thumb . And  I dunno but  I think usage of a speech recogn  r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . industrial designer:  okay , so good news from me   for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as marketing: project manager: industrial designer: Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but project manager: This one , yeah . This this is just  one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just  I just found this , that our company  developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just marketing: Inch . industrial designer: Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . industrial designer: Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .  first thing is  this will be the overall shape , no  I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .  the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can   And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can  supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just  two batteries and solar cells , so .  the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is  seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . Then the graphical card  for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can  we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches .  I have to check what I wanted to  from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des  ov all the device . project manager: Can you fit any  for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . industrial designer: A all these things in in  in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , project manager: Okay . user interface: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . marketing: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , industrial designer: Yeah ? marketing: how big is it in reality ? industrial designer: Well , seven to seven inches . industrial designer: marketing:   have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? project manager: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , industrial designer: Yeah but project manager: I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . industrial designer: To be honest , I was project manager: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . industrial designer: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , no no problem , user interface: industrial designer: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . industrial designer: So marketing: industrial designer: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . marketing: So , what's the size of the device ? industrial designer: Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . marketing: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still industrial designer: Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . marketing: Is it Can you hold that , or ? industrial designer: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . project manager: A sm industrial designer: marketing: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? user interface: industrial designer: W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , project manager: So maybe you can finish your presentation , user interface: project manager: and afterwards we will discuss about all this .  , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .  first I think energy it's a key problem because  it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? industrial designer: Not J  just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_  speech recognition and L_C_D_ , project manager: Okay . project manager: but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery industrial designer: Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . marketing: So if we use s solar cells ,  where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? industrial designer: S  d doesn't need to be sun . industrial designer: Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that  that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . project manager: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . industrial designer: Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? marketing: project manager: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . industrial designer: Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . user interface: project manager: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . industrial designer: project manager:  what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this  a such a a a screen . Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ? user interface:  . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . You can take  some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f  taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So  seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . industrial designer: Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one   How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . industrial designer: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . industrial designer: Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . user interface: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove  keys and just  having  , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . user interface: So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , project manager: Yeah . user interface: because project manager: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . user interface: project manager: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . marketing: So industrial designer: Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me user interface: A smaller s project manager: Yeah okay .  something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and industrial designer: Seven to ten banana . marketing: Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . user interface: marketing:  what other what other fruit and vegetables project manager: But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but marketing: Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: industrial designer: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . Well user interface: project manager: Yeah , and industrial designer: user interface: I think this is not good . project manager: The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite ,  with curves . industrial designer: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . industrial designer: Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit  fatter than than the c c common one . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be   really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . project manager: So we are agree with the banana thing ? industrial designer: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? user interface: Okay . project manager: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . You have other thing to add to this point , or  no ? So ,  about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . You talked about the buttons on the side industrial designer: Like like peeling of the banana you s user interface: Yeah , peeling of the banana . marketing: industrial designer: First layer obviously spo Yeah , project manager: So industrial designer: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . project manager: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? user interface:  project manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . marketing: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , project manager: Yeah . marketing: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and user interface: user interface: Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering  some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in  digital camera . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be  buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and  when  and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . project manager: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . industrial designer: Well is it possible to make it soft ? user interface: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . industrial designer: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? project manager: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .  maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover  sticking to the to the all the stuff like  with magnetic p  magnetic  magnetic  materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're  while while  you are commonly using  buttons on the banana . industrial designer: Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and  how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b  So we need that the that the peeling  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if  the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and industrial designer: It is possible , but , well if it marketing: And a and a banana . industrial designer: I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . project manager: And something we forgot , maybe ,  about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? marketing: user interface: Yes , I think . project manager: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , user interface:  . marketing: user interface: project manager: And  , yeah , I  I think you should work together , s you  Hamed and Peter , to work  in a in a first prototype , and  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together "

        "professor c: So ,  grad f: so I wanted to discuss digits briefly , but that won't take too long . OK , agenda items , we have digits , What else we got ? phd a: New version of the presegmentation . postdoc b: do we wanna say something about the , an update of the , transcript ? phd g: Yeah , why don't you summarize the professor c: Update on transcripts . phd g: And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too . professor c: Filtering for what ? phd g: For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead . postdoc b: It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning . OK well , the , w  as you can see from the numbers on the digits we 're almost done . You know , someone fills out the form and then they 're not at the meeting and so it 's blank . And so , once we 're it 's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data . phd d: So we 'll have a corpus that 's the size of TI - digits ? grad f: And so One particular test set of TI - digits . grad f: So , I I extracted , Ther - there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set . It had been randomized and so on phd d:  grad f: and that 's just what I used to generate the order . professor c: So , I 'm impressed by what we could do , Is take the standard training set for TI - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have ,  for instance , and then test on  this test set . grad f:  professor c: And presumably  it should do reasonably well on that , and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly . professor c: And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better . grad f: so that the reason it 's not just a transcript is that there 're false starts , and misreads , and miscues and things like that . And so I have a set of scripts and X Waves where you just select the portion , hit R , it tells you what the next one should be , and you just look for that . You know , so it it 'll put on the screen , \" The next set is six nine , nine two two \" . And you find that , and , hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format . professor c: So is this grad f: And so the the question is , should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ? Well , some of us . I 've been do I 've done , eight meetings , something like that , just by hand .  professor c: what what do you think ? postdoc b: My feeling is that we discussed this right before coffee and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set , but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them . And also it is contributing to the , c composition of the transcript cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript . grad f: There is there is professor c: So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ? postdoc b:   grad f: There 's one other small bit , which is just entering the information which at s which is at the top of this form , onto the computer , to go along with the where the digits are recorded automatically . grad f: And so it 's just , you know , typing in name , times time , date , and so on .  , which again either they can do , but it is , you know , firing up an editor , or , again , I can do . postdoc b: And , that , you know , I 'm not , that that one I 'm not so sure if it 's into the the , things that , I , wanted to use the hours for , because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on . postdoc b: But that 's really your choice , it 's your phd d: So are these two separate tasks that can happen ? Or do they have to happen at the same time before grad f: No they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time . grad f: So it 's it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it , and then when you start using my scripts , for extracting the times , it adds the times at the bottom of the file . And so , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order . grad f: it 's it 's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double - check , to make sure you 're entering for the right person . Yeah just by way of  , a  , order of magnitude , we 've been working with this Aurora ,  data set . And , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , is about ,  I think the best score was something like five percent , error , per digit . So So the The point there , and this is  car noise  ,  things , but but real real situation , phd d:   professor c: well , \" real \" , the  there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant .  but in a car , instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise . So , that 's that 's an indication ,  that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth , so . More typical numbers like phd d: Although the models weren't , that good , right ?  , the models are pretty crappy ? professor c: You 're right . I think that we could have done better on the models , but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , things in this task , all of the , languages . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard . phd d: How did we do on the TI - digits ? grad f: Well the prosodics are so much different s it 's gonna be , strange . grad f: So I 'm I 'm not sure how much of effect that will have . phd d: H how do phd g: What do you mean , the prosodics ? grad f: just what we were talking about with grouping . That with these , the grouping , there 's no grouping at all , and so it 's just the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end . phd g: So what are they doing in Aurora , are they reading actual phone numbers , grad f: Aurora I don't know . phd g: or , a a digit at a time , or ? professor c: I 'm not sure how phd g: Cuz it 's professor c: no , no  it 's connected it 's connected , digits , phd g: Connected . phd g: So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different . phd d: H How grad f: But in TI - digits , they 're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that , phd g: Right . phd d: do we do on TI - digits ? grad f: so it 's gonna be different . grad f: One and a half percent , two percent , something like that ? professor c: I th no I think we got under a percent , but it was but it 's but  . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random , grad f: OK . professor c: But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent , grad f: Right . grad f: But that  it 's really it 's it 's close - talking mikes , no noise , clean signal , just digits , every everything is good . phd g: It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life , phd d: Pre - prehistory . grad f: OK , so , what I 'll do then is I 'll go ahead and enter , this data . And then , hand off to Jane , and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits . One question I have that that  , we wouldn't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti  , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on . The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , just doing the simple mapping , from , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , isn't right . In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth . But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much . Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that , postdoc b: and that people might articulate more , and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence . phd d: Sort of less predictability , grad f: That it 's just postdoc b:   phd d: and You hafta grad f: It 's a Well Would , this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ? phd g: Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns . phd g: So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference . So , may maybe the thing will be do to take some very small subset ,  not have a big , program , but take a small set , subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits , and look and and just get a feeling for it . postdoc b: H That could could be an interesting design , too , cuz then you 'd have the com the comparison of the , predictable speech versus the less predictable speech professor c: Cuz I don't think anybody is , I at least , I don't know , of anybody , well , I don't know , the answers . postdoc b: and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , non - predictable . phd d: Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , you know , tense lax . grad f: M I think we can get Ohala in to , give us some advice on that . postdoc b: Also I thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features , that professor c: Yeah , but I I I I was , like he said , I was gonna bring John in and ask John what he thought . It should be such that if you , if you , if you had o  , all of the features , determined that you that you were  ch have chosen , that that would tell you , in the steady - state case , the phone . grad f: Even , I guess with vowels that would be pretty hard , wouldn't it ? To identify actually , you know , which one it is ? postdoc b: It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g  ,  that 's I think about articulatory features , I think about , points of articulation , which means , rather than vowels . phd d: Points of articulation ? What do you mean ? postdoc b: So , is it , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal . phd g: Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce . And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling professor c: Right . That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence . And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that , because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones . professor c: Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about , but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones . One you know , one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something , like , \" gonna see you tomorrow \" , grad f: And Or \" gonta \" . phd g: it could be \" going to \" or \" gonna \" or \" gonta s \" you know . And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well . phd g: Because , it 's not , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation . grad f: Well I don't think Morgan 's suggesting that we do that , though . professor c: Yeah , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it . So for instance , you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states , and has   , comes from articulatory gestures to that . But  , grad f: But What I 'm imagining is a score - like notation , where each line is a particular feature . grad f: so you would say , you know , it 's voiced through here , and so you have label here , and you have nas nasal here , and , they they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones . professor c:  this is the kind of reason why I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that  when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , \" can't be done \" . professor c: He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones , and when you actually look at Switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . It , grad f: And in in fact the inter - annotator agreement was not that good , right ? On the harder ones ? professor c: yeah  it was phd g: It depends how you look at it , and I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly , professor c: Yeah . phd g: because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth . phd g: All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced .  , if you 're gonna add the features it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you professor c:   phd g: because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion . phd d: So it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these . phd g: And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow , I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but . professor c: Yeah u I don't disagree with it the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something , i it 's all compromised , right , so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened . But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened . And it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation  lexicon that has three or four , grad f: The word . professor c: this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever , phd d: So it 's like a continuum . phd g: an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere . phd g: So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram , phd d:   phd g: but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say . phd g: And then there are other cases where , nasality , voicing phd d: It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal . grad f: Well the other difference is that the the features , are not synchronous , phd g: Right . phd g: Th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features . grad f: Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system , that the states were features , rather than phones . phd g: And i if you 're Well , we we 've probably have a separate , discussion of ,  of whether you can do that . postdoc b: That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ? grad f: Yeah . postdoc b: I thought professor c: Yeah , so  , what , what where this is , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind , so it should be something broader . But , The but  where I 'm coming from is , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , they , have , a m a multi - band system that is , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to  , estimate , the , value for m for for a particular feature . And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this . And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone and and , you know . But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .  , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week , And and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right . That , that if we , can we should put in , another level of , of description there if we 're gonna get into some of this low - level stuff . phd d: Well , you know ,   if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like , You know , you The the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ? Or do they do that on , Switchboard ? grad f: That 's what I was saying , postdoc b: W Well it seems like you could do both . postdoc b: I was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of Switchboard anyway , in terms of , professor c:   postdoc b:  partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level . phd d: Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions . phd d: You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did , postdoc b:   phd g: it is telephone band , so , the bandwidth might be phd d: It 'd be a complete , set then . So  i we 'll see wha how much we can , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing , phd g: Yeah . phd d: But it it might be good to do what Jane was saying  , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or Steve 's transcriptions or something . grad f: Alright , so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous , but then you could imagine , nudging them here and there . professor c: Well I think what  I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now . But I think that , Steve and the gang are doing , something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment . So  that 's probably the right way to go anyway , is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that , that , you know , tries , to label it all . postdoc b: So in in our case you 'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry , and then ? Or would we professor c: Well , regular dictionary , this is a pretty rich dictionary .",
        " It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it postdoc b: But phd d: Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions . phd g: the problem is when you run , if you run a regular dictionary , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations , phd d: Yeah . phd g: so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation , postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: and so y they they I thought that they were professor c: Is that what they 're doing ? grad f: They are . professor c: Yeah , so I think that i i we also don't have , we 've got a good start on it , but we don't have a really good , meeting , recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet , so . So ,  another way to look at this is to , is to , do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it . professor c: And then , As we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data . postdoc b: And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA . professor c: Yeah postdoc b: They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory . phd d: Are they busy for the next couple years , or ? postdoc b: Well , you know ,  they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us , so  I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it . phd g: It might be grad f:  you 'd you 'd want models for spreading . phd g: I was thinking it might be n phd d: Of the f acoustic features ? grad f: Yeah . phd g: Well it might be neat to do some , phonetic , features on these , nonword words . Are are these kinds of words that people never the \" huh \"s and the \"  \"s and the \" huh \" and the  These k No , I 'm serious . phd g: And some of them are , yeah , \"  - huh \"s , and \"  \"s , and , \"  ! \" \"  \" \" OK \" , \"  \" Grunts , that might be interesting . professor c: new version of , presegmentation ? phd a: oh yeah , I worked a little bit on the on the presegmentation to to get another version which does channel - specific , speech - nonspeech detection . And , what I did is I used some normalized features which , look in into the which is normalized energy , energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the , minimum over the , other . And to to , to , yeah , to normalize also loudness and and modified loudness and things and that those special features actually are in my feature vector . phd a: And , and , therefore to be able to , somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in in the different in each channel . And , eh , I tested it on on three or four meetings and it seems to work , well yeah , fairly well , I I would say . grad f: So I I understand that 's what you were saying about your problem with , minimum . phd a: Yeah yeah , then I I did some some some things like that , postdoc b: Interesting . phd a: as there there are some some problems in , when , in the channel , there they the the speaker doesn't doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all . Then , the , yeah , there are there are some problems with with with n with normalization , and , then , there the system doesn't work at all . So , I 'm I 'm glad that there is the the digit part , where everybody is forced to say something , professor c: Right . And , the thing is I I , then the evaluation of of the system is a little bit hard , as I don't have any references . phd a: Yeah , that 's the one one wh where I do the training on so I can't do the evaluation on So the thing is , can the transcribers perhaps do some , some some meetings in in terms of speech - nonspeech in in the specific channels ? grad f:  . postdoc b: Well , I have phd d: Well won't you have that from their transcriptions ? postdoc b: Well , OK , so , now we need grad f: No , cuz we need is really tight . postdoc b: so , I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing . postdoc b: I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels . postdoc b: And I could And And grad f: Hopefully that 's not the same meeting that we did . postdoc b: So , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts . postdoc b: And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format . postdoc b: And then you have , all these things split across according to channel , and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel , phd a: OK . postdoc b: and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels , phd a: OK . postdoc b: cuz his his interface allows me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels . phd a: so , yeah yeah , that that that 's great , but what would be nice to have some more meetings , not just one meeting to to be sure that that , there is a system , phd d: So , current This week . grad f: Yeah , so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision I think that would be a good idea .  , how how m much time so the meetings vary in length , what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ? phd a: It seems to me that it would be good to have , a few minutes from from different meetings , so . postdoc b: OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ? phd a: Both both . professor c: Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet ,  we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have  , couple examples of . grad e: Even probably with the gains differently will affect it , you mean phd a: not really as professor c: Poten - potentially . phd g: We can try running we haven't done this yet because , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer . phd g: cuz we 're running the evals and I just don't have machine time there . But , once that 's moved over , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . phd g: And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary . Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine , phd a: Yeah . M phd g: but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not . phd a: I I would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for for the system , as I 'm not sure if if it 's really good to compare with with some other automatic , found boundaries . postdoc b: Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ? phd a: Yeah . phd g: but , I would have maybe a transciber , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those . phd g: If they 're horrible it won't help at all , but they might not be horrible . postdoc b: How many minutes would you want from  , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have . phd a: If it 's not the first minute of of the meeting , that that 's OK with me , but , in in the first minute , Often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really , well , for , which which aren't re re really good . What what I 'd quite like , perhaps , is , to have , some five minutes of of of different meetings , so . postdoc b: And , then I wanted to ask you just for my inter information , then , would you , be trai cuz I don't quite unders so , would you be training then , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ? So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , to , providing tighter time bands ? phd a: I I could do a a retraining with that , yeah . phd a: That 's but but I hope that I I don't need to do it . phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , but , for for for those three meetings whi which I which I did , it seems to be , quite well , but , there are some some as I said some problems with the lapel mike , but , perhaps we can do something with with cross - correlations to , to get rid of the of those . Well well what I want to do is to to look into cross - correlations for for removing those , false overlaps . phd g: Are the , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ?  , have you noticed any difference ? phd a: I 'm I 'm not sure , if if there are any wired mikes in those meetings , or , I have have to loo have a look at them but , I 'm I 'm I think there 's no difference between , phd g: So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ? phd a: Yeah . postdoc b: OK , so then , if that 's five minutes per meeting we 've got like twelve minutes , twelve meetings , roughly , that I 'm that I 've been working with , then professor c: Of of of the meetings that you 're working with , how many of them are different , tha phd a: No . professor c: are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ? postdoc b: Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ? professor c: Yeah , speakers . postdoc b: just from what I 've seen , there are some where , you 're present or not present , and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group phd a: Yeah , I know , some of the NSA meetings , yeah . professor c: Do you have any of Jerry 's meetings in your , pack , er , postdoc b: no . professor c: No ? postdoc b: We could ,  you you recorded one last week or so . professor c: and and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think . postdoc b: OK , so if I , OK , included include , OK , then , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour and I could get the transcribers to do that right  , what  is , that would be an hour sampled , and then they 'd transcribe those that hour , right ? That 's what I should do ? professor c: Yeah . So they get it into the multi - channel format and then adjust the timebands so it 's precise . professor c: So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing , postdoc b: Absolutely . postdoc b: Oh gosh , well , last night , I did about half an hour in , three hours , which is not , terrific , professor c: Yeah . postdoc b: but , anyway , it 's an hour and a half per professor c: Yeah . phd a: Do the transcribers actually start wi with , transcribing new meetings , or are they ? postdoc b: Well ,  they 're still working they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting , phd a: OK . postdoc b: but the next , m m I was about to need to assign a new meeting and I was going to take it from one of the new ones , phd a: OK . phd g: So they 're really running out of , data , prett  that 's good . professor c: They 're running out of data unless we s make the decision that we should go over and start , transcribing the other set . postdoc b: And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news . postdoc b: We funded the experiment with ,  also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the , Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through . So , Liz , and and Don , and I met this morning , in the BARCO room , with the lecture hall , professor c: OK . postdoc b: and this afternoon , it drifted into the afternoon , concerning this issue of , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer . And , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data , so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s  , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber , and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that . And , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . And , then , I run it through , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , these units that result , in a a particular channel and a particular timeband , at at that level , vary in length . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean . And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things . postdoc b: And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , with the at that level , are sufficient . And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece - wise , maybe it won't be the whole thing . So , that 's that 's what we were discussing , this morning as far as I Among phd g: Right . postdoc b: also we discussed some adaptational things , phd g: Then lots of postdoc b: so it 's like , phd g: Right . postdoc b:  You know I hadn't , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example , but if someone says , PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from , the transcript what they said , professor c:   It 's like y it 's and so , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase , and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase but that 's OK .  , and also I 'll be , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material . So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth . Or a non - vocal sound like a doors door - slam , and that can be easily done with a , you know , just a one little additional thing in the , in the general format . phd g: Yeah we j we just needed a way to , strip , you know , all the comments , all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .  , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , mouth noise , or , cough . And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like , well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is , grad f: Right . phd g: and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct . And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer , and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these , but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea . And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel , they 're like it 's in the room . phd g: And  , Jane had this nice , idea of having , like an extra ,  couple tiers , grad f: An extra channel . So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel because maybe it was someone else 's breath , or  , so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing . phd g: So a lot of little details , but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that . So the idea is then , Don can take , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer and we can , can run these . So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data . And , you know , start , working on it , postdoc b: And phd g: so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript . I 'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way , will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of , time , dividing things . Just from I dunno how long were you did one ? grad e: I saw a couple , around twenty seconds , and that was just without looking too hard for it , so , I would imagine that there might be some that are longer . postdoc b: Well n One question , e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ? grad e: No . No , but if we 're gonna segment it , like if there 's one speaker in there , that says \" OK \" or something , right in the middle , it 's gonna have a lot of dead time around it , phd g: Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place grad e: so it 's not postdoc b: Yeah . phd g: You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there , and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input . phd a: I I I thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the those mult multi - channel , speech - nonspeech detections , if they would like to . phd g: So that 's probably what will happen , but we 'll try it this way and see . We 'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross - talk , and , noises and things . postdoc b: Oh I wanted to ask one thing , the microphones the new microphones , professor c: Yeah ? K . postdoc b: when do we get ,  ? grad f: they said it would take about a week . phd g: So what happens to our old microphones ? professor c: They go where old microphones go . grad f:  phd g: Do we give them to someone , or ? grad f: Well the only thing we 're gonna have extra , for now , phd g: We don't have more receivers , we just have grad f: Right , we don so the only thing we 'll have extra now is just the lapel . Since , what I decided to do , on Morgan 's suggestion , was just get two , new microphones , and try them out . grad f: Since they 're they 're like two hundred bucks a piece , we won't , at least try them out . phd d: So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ? grad f: Yep . phd d: What 's the , style of the headset ? grad f: It 's , it 's by Crown , and it 's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies , and , when I s when I mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the Sony . grad f: And I checked on the web , and every site I went to , raved about this particular mike . It 's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well , so we 'll see if it 's any good . postdoc b: You said it was used by aerobics instructors ? grad f:  Yep . professor c: For the recor for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown . professor c: I said \" For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown \" . grad f: The P Z Ms are Crown , aren't they ? professor c: Yeah . professor c: So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings . professor c: Oh , yeah , what Which 'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting . grad f: Cuz then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings . phd a: S s grad f: Pause between the lines , remember ? grad e: Excuse me "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  .

        "Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill? kirsty williams am: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses? kirsty williams am: Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future. sian gwenllian am: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required? kirsty williams am: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens. sian gwenllian am: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon. sian gwenllian am: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that? kirsty williams am: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity? kirsty williams am: Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add? huw morris: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014 kirsty williams am: At this stage\u2014 sian gwenllian am: \u2014or are you still thinking about it? kirsty williams am: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward. sian gwenllian am: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation? kirsty williams am: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do? kirsty williams am: Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill? kirsty williams am: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers. lynne neagle am: Okay, Janet? janet finch-saunders am: Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis? kirsty williams am: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight. dawn bowden am: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers? kirsty williams am: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure. hefin david am: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014 kirsty williams am: That's a very HEFCW thing to say. hefin david am: \u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. kirsty williams am: I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out? huw morris: Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014 hefin david am: That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those. huw morris: In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. kirsty williams am: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do. kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising? kirsty williams am: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution.",
        " But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary. hefin david am: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans? kirsty williams am: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation. hefin david am: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you? kirsty williams am: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. hefin david am: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better? kirsty williams am: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements. hefin david am: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused. kirsty williams am: That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better. hefin david am: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others? kirsty williams am: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular? hefin david am: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion? kirsty williams am: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014 hefin david am: I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received. huw morris: If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014 hefin david am: Because that happens at Stage 1. Sorry, can I move on to the next item? lynne neagle am: Oh, you're going on to the next section. hefin david am: Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014 lynne neagle am: Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame? kirsty williams am: As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance? kirsty williams am: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014 kirsty williams am: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself. hefin david am: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated. huw morris: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily. hefin david am: But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales. kirsty williams am: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. hefin david am: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped? kirsty williams am: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself? kirsty williams am: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014 dawn bowden am: Is that the risk review process in\u2014? kirsty williams am: That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be. dawn bowden am: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think? kirsty williams am: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward. dawn bowden am: But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged? huw morris: One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity. lynne neagle am: Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland? kirsty williams am: As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance? kirsty williams am: Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years. sian gwenllian am: So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that? kirsty williams am: Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. huw morris: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. sian gwenllian am: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice? kirsty williams am: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. sian gwenllian am: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us: kirsty williams am: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity. Will the new Bill address these issues? kirsty williams am: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE? huw morris: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities. sian gwenllian am: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this. huw morris: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and for item 1 on 2 October? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "project manager:  after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . user interface: The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . user interface: The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . industrial designer: On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype  they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . industrial designer: So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in .  the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , user interface: Thumb-shaped . industrial designer: and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . And did you determine  the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? user interface: industrial designer: I'd say a single . marketing: Yeah , I think it's a beautiful project manager: It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . project manager: Alright industrial designer: project manager: what's next in our agenda ?  we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney .  so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable  yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . user interface: Feel good meaning what ? marketing: Like does it feel good , like user interface: Physically , project manager: Right . industrial designer: Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . Okay so , we're using the criteria  for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? project manager: Are we going to indi user interface: True or false , easy to use . project manager: I say we individually rate what do you say ? marketing: You guys project manager: Just orally . user interface: industrial designer: I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . project manager: Oh , and ma it's a prototype , marketing: Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . user interface: But then I'm not fashionable , so marketing: Yeah , it's a two . marketing:  user interface: marketing: does it feel good ? project manager: Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . user interface: Does it feel good ? marketing: I feel like industrial designer:  the shape of it actually does  . industrial designer: marketing:  yeah ,  and it does it have voice  the phrase recognition on it ? project manager: Yes . It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , marketing: And there's no way you can represent it on here . marketing: Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? industrial designer: It project manager: Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . marketing: And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , project manager: Right . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so user interface: Yeah I go four . project manager: Alright , and the last criteria is it is it  user interface: Squishy and fruity . project manager: Well , we've covered that with the user interface: It's just trendy , basically . marketing: So  our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and  hopefully we'll sell millions . industrial designer: How did you get that in there ? user interface: marketing: What ? industrial designer: The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit .  it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a industrial designer: Yep . project manager: But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . What do you say ? industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: marketing: Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . project manager: I think  I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically industrial designer: it's . marketing: We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , project manager: right . We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , industrial designer: Yep . marketing: But it's Yeah , project manager: This ? marketing: but i so i industrial designer: Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . marketing: But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . user interface: Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and industrial designer: Push-button . project manager: Right I think she's industrial designer: But we just have push user interface: push-buttons . project manager: I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? marketing: Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . marketing: So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? project manager: I don't know , they might put us well , let's just . user interface: Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? project manager: Two or would it be three ? industrial designer: Let's call it th marketing: Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . project manager: and we're gonna user interface: project manager: button supplements the buttons are no  okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process  and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result .  did we have a lot of room for creativity ? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership ,  teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . Who want who would like to go first ? industrial designer: We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . project manager: And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? marketing: Oh , overall  I thought we did a good job like user interface: marketing: We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . project manager: Right , and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like marketing: And we're a fashion forward technology company . project manager:  what about  the teamwork aspect ? How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? marketing: industrial designer: Yeah .  minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? project manager: Irritating . marketing: And the digital the digital pens user interface: Like it's information project manager: Yeah , digital pens . marketing: Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . project manager: Right , laptops are extremely handy , industrial designer: It was wireless too , so . And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the marketing: And these things whoa . industrial designer: project manager: 'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? marketing:  we are really gonna sell this . project manager: For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . project manager: And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . project manager: If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think  that's not what technology . user interface: Well , that's why I don't like  Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . user interface: Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .  how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . user interface: But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . user interface: I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . marketing: We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf .  the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , user interface: project manager: and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so "

        "What are we talking about today ? phd e: well , first there are perhaps these  Meeting Recorder digits that we tested . professor a: And for one thing that that sure shows the difference between having a lot of  training data or not , phd e: Of data ? Yeah . professor a: the  The best kind of number we have on the English  on near microphone only is is  three or four percent . professor a: And  it 's significantly better than that , using fairly simple front - ends on on the   , with the SRI system . professor a: So I th I think that the  But that 's that 's using  a a pretty huge amount of data , mostly not digits , of course , but but then again Well , yeah . In fact , mostly not digits for the actual training the H M Ms whereas  in this case we 're just using digits for training the H M phd e: Yeah . professor a: Did anybody mention about whether the the SRI system is a is is doing the digits  the wor as a word model or as  a sub s sub - phone states ? phd e: I guess it 's it 's  allophone models , professor a: Yeah . There is one difference Well , the SRI system the result for the SRI system that are represented here are with adaptation . So there is It 's their complete system and including on - line  unsupervised adaptation . phd e: And if you don't use adaptation , the error rate is around fifty percent worse , I think , if I remember . professor a: It 's tha it 's that much , huh ? phd e: Nnn . professor a: But but  what what I think I 'd be interested to do given that , is that we we should  take I guess that somebody 's gonna do this , right ? is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system , right ? phd e: Yeah . Our back - end is is fairly simple but until now , well , the attempts to improve it or have fail Ah , well ,   what Chuck tried to to to do professor a: Yeah , but he 's doing it with the same data , right ?  so to So there 's there 's there 's two things being affected . One is that that , you know , there 's something simple that 's wrong with the back - end . professor a:  I I don't know if he got to the point of playing with the  number of Gaussians yet phd e:   So , yeah , we could retrain some of these tandem on on huge professor a: Well , you could do that , but I 'm saying even with it not with that part not retrained , just just using having the H M Ms much better H M phd e: Ah , yeah . But what would be interesting to see also is what what perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the  recording conditions . Because it 's probably not a problem of noise , because our features are supposed to be robust to noise . phd e: It 's not a problem of channel , because there is  normalization with respect to the channel . What what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ? phd e: The the fact that the result with the tandem and Aurora system are  so much worse . professor a: I  but I 'm I 'm almost certain that it it  , that it has to do with the  amount of training data . professor a: But but having a huge If if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data .  , ordinarily you would say \" well , given that you have enough occurrences of the digits , you can just train with digits rather than with , you know \" phd e:   professor a: But the thing is , if you have a huge in other words , do word models But if you have a huge amount of data then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar  allophones . professor a: So it 's  I I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone , phd e:   Now , some of it could be the fact that  let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the training ? phd e: Yeah . Well , actually we see that the clean train for the Aurora proposals are are better than the multi - train , professor a: It is if Yeah . phd e: Well , o I guess what I meant is that well , let 's say if we if we add enough data to train on the  on the Meeting Recorder digits , I guess we could have better results than this . What I meant is that perhaps we can learn something  from this , what 's what 's wrong  what what is different between TI - digits and these digits and professor a: What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ? phd e: It 's point eight percent , so . professor a: So in the actual TI - digits database we 're getting point eight percent , phd e: Yeah . professor a: and here we 're getting three or four three , let 's see , three for this ? phd e:   Sure , but  ,  point eight percent is something like double  or triple what people have gotten who 've worked very hard at doing that . professor a: And and also , as you point out , there 's adaptation in these numbers also . So if you , you know , put the ad adap take the adaptation off , then it for the English - Near you get something like two percent . professor a: It 's , you know , we used a simple HTK system with a modest amount of data . And this is a a , you know , modern  system  has has a lot of nice points to it . professor a: But to me it just it just meant a practical point that  if we want to publish results on digits that that people pay attention to we probably should  Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get show some nice improvement on something that 's that 's  ,  it seems like too large a number , and   people don't necessarily take it so seriously . So the three point four percent for this  is is  So why is it It 's an interesting question though , still . Why is why is it three point four percent for the d the digits recorded in this environment as opposed to the  point eight percent for for for the original TI - digits database ?  . So ignore ignoring the the the SRI system for a moment , phd e: I I I don't I   professor a: just looking at the TI - di the  tandem system , if we 're getting point eight percent , which , yes , it 's high . It 's , you know , it it 's not awfully high , phd e:   professor a: Right ?  , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise . And  I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over . professor a: It was not  there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all . TI - digit is it 's very , very clean and it 's like studio recording professor a:   But professor a: It 's I think it 's it 's the indication it 's harder .  , they 're much much better , but still you 're getting something like one point three percent for  things that are same data as in T TI - digits the same same text . And  , I 'm sure the same same system would would get , you know , point point three or point four or something on the actual TI - digits . professor a: Which I find sort of interesting cause I think this is closer to   it 's still read . But I still think it 's much closer to to what what people actually face ,  when they 're they 're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone . I don't think   , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , but I don't think that  the  the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their digits . I 'm I 'm I 'm sure they get  , for one thing people do phone up who don't have   Middle America accents and it 's a we we it 's it 's it 's US . professor a: Did we end up giving up on on , any Eurospeech submissions , phd e: But professor a: or ? I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are are submitting something , but  . I I guess e the only thing with these the Meeting Recorder and , well , So , I think , yeah I think we basically gave up . Now , actually for the for the Aur -  phd e: But professor a: we do have stuff for Aurora , right ? Because because we have ano an extra month or something . professor a: and we have We don't we don't have to flood it with papers . Perhaps the point is that we 've been working on is , yeah , we have put the  the good VAD in the system and it really makes a huge difference . I think , yeah , this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not not the best , because with the new VAD , it 's very the results are similar to the France Telecom results and perhaps even better sometimes . The problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it and  , professor a:   phd e: because it it well , this VAD  either some delay and we if we put it on the server side , it doesn't work , because on the server side features you already have LDA applied from the f from the terminal side and so you accumulate the delay so the VAD should be before the LDA which means perhaps on the terminal side and then smaller and professor a: So wha where did this good VAD come from ? phd e: So . So it 's the network trained it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden of hidden units , and  nine input frames compared to the VAD that was in the proposal which has a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs . Yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ? phd e: Yeah . But the abso assumption is that we will be able to make a VAD that 's small and that works fine .  ,  i if if there 's a if if I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk but  if everybody agreed sure let 's use this VAD and take that out of there phd e:   They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and and VAD or frame dropping But they still want to just to give some  requirement for this VAD because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard . But I was thinking that that  s \" Sure , there may be some interaction , phd e: Nnn . professor a: but I don't think we need to be stuck on using our or OGI 's VAD .  I designed a new a new filter because when I designed other filters with shorter delay from the LDA filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds professor a: Right . phd e: and  Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s I think it 's sixty - five . Both should have sixty - five because professor a: You didn't gain anything , right ? phd e: Yeah . phd e: Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of  voiced - unvoiced stuff . phd e: And next week I think we will perhaps try to have  a new system with   MSG stream also see what what happens . phd d: No , I w I begin to play with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision . And we they we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the sq the variance between the  FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time we after the  mel filter bank . So , basically we wa want to look at something like the ex the ex excitation signal and professor a: Right . phd d: The the mix of the two , noise and unnoise , and the signal is this . professor a: Well , I 'm s  There 's None of these axes are labeled , so I don't know what this What 's this axis ? phd d:  this is  this axis is nnn , \" frame \" . professor a: And what 's th what this ? phd d: this is  energy , log - energy of the spectrum . Of the this is the variance , the difference between the spectrum of the signal and FFT of each frame of the signal and this mouth spectrum of time after the f may fit for the two , professor a: For this one . phd d: Pity , but I don't have two different professor a: And presumably when there 's a a phd e: So this should the the the t voiced portions . This is trying to obtain with LPC model the spectrum but using Matlab without going factor and s professor a: No pre - emphasis ? Yeah . So now I wonder  , do you want to I know you want to get at something orthogonal from what you get with the smooth spectrum  . But if you were to really try and get a voiced - unvoiced , do you do you want to totally ignore that ?  , do you do you  , clearly a a very big very big cues for voiced - unvoiced come from  spectral slope and so on , right ? phd e:   phd d: if s @ @ val value is indicative that is a voice frame and it 's low values professor a: Yeah . Well , you probably want  , certainly if you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features . But , you know , people look at at slope and  first auto - correlation coefficient , divided by power . professor a: Or or   there 's  I guess we prob probably don't have enough computation to do a simple pitch detector or something ?  with a pitch detector you could have a have a an estimate of of what the phd e: Mmm . Or maybe you could you just do it going through the P FFT 's figuring out some  probable  harmonic structure . phd d: you have read up and you have a paper , the paper that you s give me yesterday . But Yeah , but it 's not it 's , yeah , it 's it 's another problem . phd e: What 's this again ? Is it the mel - filters ? phd d: Yeah like this . phd e: and what we clearly see is that in some cases , and it clearly appears here , and the the harmonics are resolved by the f Well , there are still appear after mel - filtering , professor a:   phd e: and it happens for high pitched voice because the width of the lower frequency mel - filters is sometimes even smaller than the pitch . phd e: And so what happens is that this  , add additional variability to this envelope and  professor a: Yeah . phd e: so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies . What I was talking about was just , starting with the FFT you could you could  do a very rough thing to estimate estimate  pitch . professor a: And   , given you know , given that ,  you could   come up with some kind of estimate of how much of the low frequency energy was was explained by by   those harmonics . And and so if you if you just you know subtracted off  your guess of the harmonics then something like this would end up with quite a bit lower energy in the first fifteen hundred hertz or so and and our first kilohertz , even . professor a: And  if was  noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be if it was if it was unvoiced or something . What 's up with you ? grad b:  our t I went to talk with  Mike Jordan this this week professor a:   grad b:  and  shared with him the ideas about  extending the Larry Saul work and  I asked him some questions about factorial H M so like later down the line when we 've come up with these these feature detectors , how do we how do we  you know ,  model the time series that that happens  and and we talked a little bit about factorial H M Ms and how  when you 're doing inference or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for for these H M and the  the great advantages that  a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't  don't over - alert the problem there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on on  the sub - problems at hand so you can imagine  five or so parallel  features  transitioning independently and then at the end you you  couple these factorial H M Ms with  with  undirected links  based on based on some more data . grad b: So he he seemed he seemed like really interested in in  in this and said said this is this is something very do - able and can learn a lot and  yeah , I 've just been continue reading  about certain things . grad b:  thinking of maybe using   m modulation spectrum stuff to  as features  also in the in the sub - bands professor a:   grad b: because it seems like the modulation  spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of of certain  words and stuff So ,  . And  so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work and   I 'll try to write up in my next stat status report a nice description of what he 's doing , but it 's it 's an approach to deal with reverberation or that the aspect of his work that I 'm interested in the idea is that  normally an analysis frames are  too short to encompass reverberation effects  in full . You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window and so you you 'd like it to be that  the reverberation responses  simply convolved  in , but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames cuz you j But if you take , say , a two millisecond  window I 'm sorry a two second window then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response is included in the window and the then it  then things are l more linear . It is it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved and  and you can use channel normalization techniques like  in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed . He just does  mean subtraction , which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum and that 's supposed to d  deal  deal pretty well with the  reverberation and  the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer  so he does this  method training trading the  the spectral resolution for time resolution and  come ca  synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s  frequency resolution . I guess it 's these are called \" time frequency representations \" and h he 's making the the time sh  finer grained and the frequency resolution  less fine grained . grad c: s so I 'm I guess my first stab actually in continuing his work is to  re - implement this this thing which  changes the time and frequency resolutions cuz he doesn't have code for me . grad c: Oh , and  , another f first step is  , so the the way I want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response  and  we don't really know how fast the  the reverberation response is varying the Meeting Recorder data  so  we we have this  block least squares  imp echo canceller implementation and  I want to try finding the the response , say , between a near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller and looking at the echo canceller taps and then see how fast that varies from block to block . grad c: That should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing . S so  y you do I think you read some of the the zeros as O 's and some as zeros . grad c: Is there a particular way we 're supposed to read them ? phd e: There are only zeros here . \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" \" O \" and \" zero \" are two ways that we say that digit . professor a: So it 's grad b: Ha ! phd e: But professor a: so it 's i phd e: Perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the if we want to the the guy to say \" O \" or professor a: No . professor a:  in digit recognition we 've done before , you have you have two pronunciations for that value , \" O \" and \" zero \" . phd e: But it 's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then , if because here you only have zeros professor a: No , they just write phd e: and and people pronounce \" O \" or zero professor a: they they write down OH . phd e: Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the \" O \" .  , you 'd have to tell them \" OK when we write this , say it tha \" , phd e: OK . professor a: you know , and you just They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would phd e:   Is this a change from the last batch of of  forms ? Because in the last batch it was spelled out which one you should read . It was it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things . professor a: That 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups . Actually , let me just s since since you brought it up , I was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it . But I realized that that  when I 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and and saying these numbers , I almost always say zero . So that that that 's the habit I 'm in , but some people say \" O \" and grad b: Yeah I normally say \" O \" cuz it 's easier to say "

        "phd a: Why is it so cold in here ? professor b: so , we haven't sent around the agenda . So , i  , any agenda items anybody has , wants to talk about , what 's going on ? postdoc g: I c I could talk about the meeting .  phd a: Well , I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed , but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker . professor b: OK , so let 's let 's So let 's just do agenda building right now . You were gonna starting to say something ? postdoc g: Well , you you , already know about the meeting that 's coming up and I don't know if if this is appropriate for this . phd e: What meeting ? professor b: We can so we can ta so n NIST is NIST folks are coming by next week postdoc g: OK . professor b: I think phd e: Who 's coming ? professor b: John Fiscus postdoc g: An - anything else , strike anybody ? phd a: we started running recognition on one conversation but it 's the r isn't working yet . phd e: Wha phd a: the main thing would be if anyone has , knowledge about ways to , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition , that would be helpful to know about . professor b: Yeah , so ,  phd e: What about , is there anything new with the speech , nonspeech stuff ? phd c: Yeah , we 're working more on it but , it 's not finished . postdoc g: I had thought under my topic that I would mention the , four items that I I , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting , which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans . professor b: Alright , why don't we start off with this , u u I guess the order we brought them up seems fine . So the one issue was that the the , lapel mike , isn't as good as you would like . Right ? phd a: Ri -  , professor b: Is that is that basically the point ? phd a: yeah , the And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal . And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,  or and even on prosody , which Don is gonna be working on soon , it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar . phd a: So And I also talked to Mari this morning and she also had a strong preference for doing that . And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too . Right , so one th grad h: Well , so professor b: well one thing I was gonna say was that , i we could get more , of the head mounted microphones even beyond the number of radio channels we have because I think whether it 's radio or wire is probably second - order . grad h: So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds don't get on it . grad h: And then just sort of about , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth . phd a: But we have more than one type of professor b: How am I d phd a: for instance , you 're phd c: Yeah . phd a: But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , as much as possible that would be really helpful . professor b: Well ,  it doesn't hurt to have a few extra microphones around , phd d: Yeah . professor b: so why don't we just go out and and get an order of of if this microphone seems OK to people , I 'd just get a half dozen of these things . grad h: Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , some of the Jimlets aren't working . grad h: And so , w  , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working . phd e: Can we get these , wireless ? grad h: So professor b: No , but my point is phd a: But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting . professor b: R r right grad h: I I 'm not sure I 'm follow . Say that again ? professor b: Right now , we 've got , two microphones in the room , that are not quote - unquote standard . professor b: Also what we 've talked before about getting another , radio , grad h: Right . professor b: So ,  so we should go out to our full complement of whatever we can do , but have them all be the same mike . I think the original reason that it was done the other way was because , it w it was sort of an experimental thing and I don't think anybody knew whether people would rather have more variety or or , more uniformity , phd a: Right . phd a: Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n  , professor b: Yeah . phd e: Is it because You you 're saying the for dialogue purposes , so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes ? Is that what you mean ? phd a: Well Jane would know more about the transcribers . postdoc g: a couple times , so , yeah , the transcribers notice And in fact there 're some where ,  ugh well ,  there 's it 's the double thing . postdoc g: And he 's always they always they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's Adam 's channel is .  , \" Baaah ! \" phd a: Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w postdoc g: Yeah , but  it 's not just that , it 's also you know you professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: It 's also like n no breathing , no You know , it 's like it 's it 's  , professor b: Yeah . postdoc g: it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view grad h: Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath . professor b: When we 're doing grad h: Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . professor b: Yeah , probably yeah , to the store we talked about and that grad h: Yep . postdoc g: And there was some talk about , maybe the h headphones that are uncomfortable for people , to grad h: Yep . So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible . grad h: And , you know , we 're researchers , so we all have big heads . OK , so , Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February and I 've spoken with , u u a lot of people here , not everyone .  , and , he expressed an interest in seeing the room and in , seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans , which I 'll mention in a second , and also , he was interested in the pre - segmentation and then he 's also interested in the transcription conventions . postdoc g: And ,  So , it seems to me in terms of like , i i it wou You know , OK . So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room and how it how the recordings are done , and that kind of thing . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , handle multi - channel recording . grad h: Oh , I should 've I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting . I I , @ @ didn't didn't see it , yesterday but I 'm going to see it today . And , that 's that will enable us to do nice  , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments . In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that that continues to be , a terrific asset to the to the transcribers . What what I 'm doing right now is I 'm trying to include some information about which channel , there 's some speech in . I 'm just trying to do this by comparing energies ,  normalizing energies and comparing energies of the different channels . phd c: And so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there 's there 's speech in addition to to the thing we we did now which is just , speech - nonspeech detection on the mixed file . So I 'm I 'm relying on on the segmentation of the mixed file postdoc g: This is good . phd c: but I 'm I 'm trying to subdivide the speech portions into different portions if there is some activity in in different channels . postdoc g: Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID potentially . professor b: something I guess I didn't put in the list but , on that , same day later on in or maybe it 's No , actually it 's this week , Dave Gelbart and I will be , visiting with John Canny who i you know , is a CS professor , postdoc g: Oh . You know , maybe they 'd wanna stick an array mike here when we 're doing things phd e: That would be cool . professor b: or or maybe it 's it 's not a specific array microphone they want phd d: Yeah . professor b: but they might wanna just , you know , you could imagine them taking the four signals from these these table mikes and trying to do something with them  , I also had a discussion So , w  , we 'll be over over there talking with him , after class on Friday . I had a , discussion today with , Birger Kollmeier who 's a , a German , scientist who 's got a fair sized group doing a range of things . But but , he does stuff with auditory models and he 's very interested in directionality , and location , and and , head models and microphone things . And so , he 's he and possibly a student , there w there 's , a student of his who gave a talk here last year , may come here , in the fall for , sort of a five month , sabbatical . phd e: That that reminds me , I had a a thought of an interesting project that somebody could try to do with the data from here , either using , you know , the the mikes on the table or using signal energies from the head worn mikes , phd d:   phd e: and that is to try to construct a map of where people were sitting , professor b: Right . phd e: And so you could plot out who was sitting next to who professor b: A little bit , phd e: and professor b: he didn't do a very extreme thing but just it was just sort of phd d: Yeah , yeah . professor b: e e given that , the the the block of wood with the the the two mikes on either side , grad h:   professor b: if I 'm speaking , or if you 're speaking , or someone over there is speaking , it if you look at cross - correlation functions , you end up with a phd d: Yeah . professor b: if if someone who was on the axis between the two is talking , then you you get a big peak there . And if if someone 's talking on on on , one side or the other , it goes the other way . professor b: And then , it it it even looks different if th t if the two two people on either side are talking than if one in the middle . Well I was just thinking , you know , as I was sitting here next to Thilo that  , when he 's talking , my mike probably picks it up better than your guys 's mikes . phd e: So if you just looked at grad h: Oh , that 's another cl cue , phd d: Yeah . phd e: yeah , looked at the energy on my mike and you could get an idea about who 's closest to who . professor b: Yeah , well you have to the appropriate normalizations are tricky , and and and are probably the key . phd a: You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting . postdoc g: Can I ask one thing ?  , so , Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , microphone arrays . postdoc g: is there  b And I also want to say , his he can't stay all day . He needs to  , leave for  , from here to make a two forty - five flight grad h: Oh , so just morning . postdoc g: So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight but do you think that ,  that , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not . professor b: Probably not but I I 'll I 'll I 'll know better after I see him this Friday what what kind of level he wants to get involved . professor b: he might be excited to and it might be very appropriate for him to , or he might have no interest whatsoever . grad h: Is he involved in Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project . NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software . Is is he the one working on that ? professor b: Well that 's what they 're starting up . professor b: well I think they 've instrumented a room but I don't think they they haven't started recordings yet . They don't have the phd e: Are they going to do video as well ? grad h:  . grad h: Oh , cuz what what I had read was , they had a  very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this , both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff . professor b: All all I know is that they 've been talking to me about a project that they 're going to start up recording people meet in meetings . professor b: And one one notable difference u u actually I can't remember whether they were going to routinely collect video or not , but one one , difference from the audio side was that they are interested in using array mikes . The reason I didn't go for that here was because , the focus , both of my interest and of Adam 's interest was  , in impromptu situations . And we 're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations but that 's because it 's different to get data for research than to actually apply it . professor b: And so , for scientific reasons we thought it was good to instrument this room as we wanted it . But the thing we ultimately wanted to aim at was a situation where you were talking with , one or more other people i  , in in an p impromptu way , where you didn't didn't actually know what the situation was going to be . And therefore it would not it 'd be highly unlikely that room would be outfitted with with some very carefully designed array of microphones . It was just , you know , yet another piece of research and it seemed like we had enough troubles just phd e: So there 's no like portable array of mikes ? professor b: No . So there 's there 's  , there 's a whole range of things there 's a whole array of things , that people do on this . professor b: So , the ,  the big arrays , places , like  , Rutgers , and Brown , and other other places , they have , big arrays with , I don't know , a hundred hundred mikes or something . professor b: And it 's and , in fact at one point we had a a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal - processing and they were gonna do the multi - channel stuff , but it d it d we ended up not doing it . grad h: And then they have little ones too professor b: And then they had the little ones , yeah . grad h: but  but they don't have our block of wood , right ? professor b: Yeah , our block of wood is unique . professor b: But the But the No , there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something phd a:   professor b: and and ,  So , yeah , there 's there 's there 's a range of things that people do . professor b: so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that 's that 's a good thing to do .  , whenever I 've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side that 's invariably the question they ask . Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask \"  , are you recording video ? \" phd a: Right , professor b: right ? phd a: right . professor b: And and the acoustic people will always say , \" well are you doing , array microphones ? \" So it 's it 's a good thing to do , but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there 's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have .  , I know that having an array of  , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones . But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off  , channels when you 're later on ?  , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ? grad h: It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up . professor b: Yeah , if ninety - nine percent of what you 're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes , then going through the postdoc g: OK . professor b: But if you get somebody who 's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction . grad h: That 's right ,  if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it , phd a: Right . That would be fine , phd e: So to save that data you You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array ? grad h: Buy more disk space . professor b: But then , you know , there 's it there 's phd e: What you save , if you 're going to do research with it . yeah professor b: There 's I I don't know what they 're going to do and I don't know how big their array is . Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you 'd use up a lot of space . grad h: Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing . But I think in practical situations you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional . professor b: Right ? phd a: it seems professor b: So phd e: Sort of saving the result of the beam - forming . phd a: it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this , just getting the data , because there 's a number of sites like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good , but they 'll be recording with video and they 'll be You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings , and just have this other information available . So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure and then , I don't know , save it out or have whoever 's interested save that data out , transfer it there , it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . grad h: You mean to to actually get a microphone array and do that ? phd a: Well , if Even if we 're not grad h: And video and phd a: I 'm not sure about video . That 's sort of an video has a little different nature since right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .  , but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays , since if there was a community interested in this , then grad h: Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . professor b: See the problem is it it took , it took at least six months for Dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug stuff in in the microphones , and in the boxes . And so I think we could get a microphone array in here pretty easily and , have it mixed to to one channel of some sort . professor b: But , e I think for  , how we 're gonna decide For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that 's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that .  , you you want actually to you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can And to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up , we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and and six mikes .",
        " phd a: Well if there 's a way to say time to sort of solve each of these f those professor b: Yeah . phd a: So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data , who 's interested , and even if ICSI it itself isn't .  , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ? I don't know . phd a:  it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of grad h: And y it 'd certainly gets skew . phd a: once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data . I mentioned that , b as a practical matter , grad h: Just professor b: but the real issue is that , there is no way to do a recording extended to what we have now with low skew . professor b: which would mean that the sampling times and so forth would be all over the place compared to this . So it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later , but if you 're d i the kind of person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times . And and so you actually wou would want to have a completely different set up than we have , phd a: I see . But what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have a separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours which might be useful for for them . phd a: Right ,  at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts , professor b: And then we can offer up the room , phd a: and Right . professor b: Yeah , we can o offer the meetings , and the physical space , and and yeah , the transcripts , and so on . phd a: But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two , professor b: Well I thi phd a: so professor b: yeah , the thing will be , u u in in again , in talking to these other people to see what you know , what what we can do . phd e: Is there an interest in getting video recordings for these meetings ?  professor b: Right , so we have we phd e:  grad h: Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem , that you have an infrastructure problem , you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped , and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it . Internally , but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video . So it 's just postdoc g: Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video . There 's the fact that then  , if i I I 've heard comments about this before , \" why don't you just put on a video camera ? \" But you know , it 's sort of like saying , \"  , well we 're primarily interested in in some dialogue things , but , why don't we just throw a microphone out there . \"  , the thing is , once you actually have serious interest in any of these things then you actually have to put a lot of effort in . professor b: So I think NIST or LDC , or somebody like that I think is much better shape to do all that . postdoc g: I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ? grad h: Oh ! Probably not . postdoc g: A permission form ? grad h: Has Don have you s did you si I thought you did actually . grad h: Didn't you read a digit string ? phd e: You were here at a meeting before . postdoc g: Did you sign a form ? grad f: Did I ? I don't know . professor b: Yeah , we we postdoc g: But I just grad f: Can I verbally consent ? postdoc g: you know . You 're on recor you 're being recorded postdoc g: o grad f: Yeah . phd a: and professor b: we don't we don't perform electro - shock during these meetings , grad f: I don't care . phd e: How big is the data set ? postdoc g: Oh , it 's what  is one meeting . I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of of when to stop transcribing this one or So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose , and and and so phd e:  - huh . postdoc g: And , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases . So , you know , that means you know , if we 've got two already finished and they 're working on  , right now all eight of them have differe  , additional data sets . postdoc g: And , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the ,  the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps . But , just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .  , these still , when they 're finished , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned . OK , now I wanted to mention the , teleconference I had with , Jonathan Fiscus . postdoc g: He , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been , looking , spending a lot of time with I 'm not quite sure the connection , but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system . But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach . postdoc g: So what he wants me to do and what we what we will do and  , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System . And they do have some sort of software , at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS and that he wants to experiment with taking our data and putting them in that format , and see how that works out . I I I explained to him in in detail the , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript . And , you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately and and the focus on reliability . He 's he 's very  , independently he asked , \" well what about reliability ? \" So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing . OK ,  phd a: Sorry , can you explain what the ATLAS I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system . postdoc g: Well , you know , at this point I think  , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this . But , there there is a way of viewing  , whenever you have coding categories , and you 're dealing with  , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , choices that you could use for each each of them . grad h: Is is Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ? I don't remember the acronym . The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation . grad h: And that 's basically what I based the format that I did I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff . And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types . phd e: Is this the project that 's sort of , between , NIST and and , a couple of other places ? postdoc g:   And I looked through them and they mainly had to do with this , this , tree structure , annotated tree diagram thing . postdoc g: So ,  and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all . And , \" oh , and how 'd you handle this ? \" And I said , \" well , you know , this way \" and And and we had a really nice conversation .  , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury . I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , transcription . And what he said was that , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information . And , that 's ,  You know , I need to get back to him and and , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific , phd a:  . phd e: The p the people postdoc g: but I just haven't had time yet . phd e: The the folks that they 're , subcontracting out the transcription to , are they like court reporters postdoc g: Sorry , what ? Yes . phd e: or postdoc g: Apparently Well , I get the sense they 're kind of like that . Like it 's like a pool of of somewhat  , secretarial I don't think that they 're court reporters . Like medical transcriptionist type people grad h: Nu - it 's mostly it 's for their speech recognition products , phd e: But aren't they 're postdoc g: Yep . grad h: Well they they do send it out but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product . grad h: So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that . postdoc g: Up to now it 's been monologues , as far my understood . postdoc g: Brian himself downloaded So So , Adam sent them a CD and Brian himself downloaded  , cuz , you know , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do . postdoc g: And then what he 's going to do is check it , a before they go be beyond the first one . professor b: So if they hear something off in the distance they don't they just go phd e: OK . grad h: Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them . phd e: Well if you 're tran if you got that channel right there postdoc g: d  , in my case phd c: Yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah . phd a: I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files . phd a: there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before . phd e: Yeah , that 's phd a: it sort of depends where you are in postdoc g: And especially since a lot of these phd d: Yeah . grad h: And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways . postdoc g: Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly grad h: So . postdoc g: unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix . In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel , grad h: Right . postdoc g: Yeah , well phd a: Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ? grad h: Right . phd a: In other words , if postdoc g: Well , I have to ask him . postdoc g: But but the ,  I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people , and if you 're dealing furthermore with highly abstract network concepts you 've never heard of So , you know , one of these people was was transcribing the , networks group talk and she said , \" I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , \" \" but I just put them in parentheses cuz that 's the that 's the convention and I just \" Cuz you know , if you don't know grad h: Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that . grad h: The networks group meetings are all phd e: Given all of the effort that is going on here in transcribing why do we have I B M doing it ? Why not just do it all ourselves ? professor b: it 's historical .  , some point ago we thought that  , it \" boy , we 'd really have to ramp up to do that \" , phd c:  - huh . phd d: No , just professor b: you know , like we just did , and , here 's , a a , collaborating institution that 's volunteered to do it . professor b: And it still might be a good thing phd e: I 'm just wondering now phd a: Actu yeah , Mar - Mari asked me the same question as sort of professor b: but phd e: Well , I 'm I 'm wondering now if it 's grad h: Well we can talk about more details later . Let 's see what comes out of it , and and , you know , have some more discussions with them . It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format . grad h: So , Liz , with with the SRI recognizer , can it make use of some time marks ? phd a: OK , so this is a , grad h: I I guess I don't know what that means . phd a: and actually I should say this is what Don has b  , he 's already been really helpful in , chopping up these So so first of all you  , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .  , but second of all ,  in general because some of these channels , I 'd say , like , I don't know , at least half of them probably on average are g are ha are have a lot of cross - ta sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .  , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition , especially forced alignment . So , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed which we did have some problems with , and Thilo , I think told me why this was , but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning , so the SRI re phd c: No , th Yeah . They they were not switching them but what they were they were adjusting them , phd a: and they They were not phd c: so . phd a: So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments . phd a: So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , cuts that you made on the mixed signal . Right ? phd a: the problem is if we have no time marks , then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word . And so grad h: Oh , I see , phd a: if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , you know , par paragraph of of talk , grad h: it 's for the length . phd a: And , I think with phd e: Well you would need to like a forced alignment before you did the chopping , right ? phd a: No , we used the fact that So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this , whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not , grad h: It 's already chunked . And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary . That 's great , cuz the recognizer can grad h: it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also . phd a: Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think . phd a: Th - but there 's going to be a real problem , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were , which segment they belonged to . phd e: Why not do a a a forced alignment ? grad h: That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't . phd a: If you do a forced alignment on something really grad h: Got  six sixty minutes of phd a: well even if you do it on something really long you need to know you can always chop it up but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , chop . postdoc g: Now wasn't I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment , phd a: So postdoc g: after they grad h: Yeah , but professor b: I I think that they are , grad h: We 'll have to talk to Brian . professor b: yeah , I 'm sure they will and so we we have to have a dialogue with them about it . professor b: it sounds like Liz has some concerns phd a: Maybe they have some you know , maybe actually there is some , even if they 're not fine grained , maybe the transcribers professor b: and phd a: I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . postdoc g: I just you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing . But the it is true that the segments I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you but the segments that in your first meeting are great . phd a: Right , cuz postdoc g: Well , I I was thinking it would be fun to to  , if if you wouldn't mind , to give us a pre - segmentation . postdoc g: maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that  , the first transcribed meeting , the one that I transcribed . phd c: I 'm sure I have some postdoc g: Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ? grad h: February sixteenth I think . phd c: but but that 's the one where we 're , trai training on , so that 's a little bit grad h: Oh . phd c: It 's a little bit at odd to postdoc g: Oh , darn . phd a: And actually as you get transcripts just , for new meetings , we can try postdoc g:  - huh . So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers , just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of  , parameters f on the recognizer , postdoc g:   phd a: The first meeting had I think just four people , phd c: Four speakers , yeah . postdoc g: Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you . I guess the other thing , I I can't remember if we discussed this in the meeting but , I know you and I talked about this a little bit , there was an issue of , suppose we get in the , I guess it 's enviable position although maybe it 's just saying where the weak link is in the chain , where we we , we have all the data transcribed and we have these transcribers and we were we 're the we 're still a bit slow on feeding at that point we 've caught up and the the the , the weak link is is recording meetings . OK , two questions come , is you know what how how do we  , it 's not really a problem at the moment cuz we haven't reached that point but how do we step out the recorded meetings ? And the other one is , is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things ? So , I I can't remember how much we talked about this in this meeting but there was grad h: We had spoken with them about it . postdoc g: And there is one use that that also we discussed which was when , Dave finishes the and maybe it 's already finished the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .  , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps . It 's just a matter of , you know , providing So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the  , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment . professor b: One one was  , we had s had some discussion in the past about some very high level labelings , postdoc g: Yeah . The types of overlaps professor b: types of overlaps , and so forth that that someone could do . And the third one is is , just a completely wild hair brained idea that I have which is that , if ,  if we have time and people are able to do it , to take some subset of the data and do some very fine grained analysis of the speech . For instance , marking in some overlapping potentially overlapping fashion , the value of , ar articulatory features . professor b: You know , just sort of say , OK , it 's voiced from here to here , there 's it 's nasal from here to here , and so forth .",
        "  , as opposed to doing phonetic  , you know , phonemic and the phonetic analysis , grad h:  professor b: and , assuming , articulatory feature values for those those things . postdoc g: Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels , wouldn't it ?  , I would think that that , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was . professor b: but I think also it 's just the issue that that when you look at the u w u u when you look at Switchboard for instance very close up there are places where whether it 's a consonant or a vowel you still have trouble calling it a particular phone postdoc g:   grad h: Yeah , but but just saying what the professor b: because it 's you know , there 's this movement from here to here postdoc g: Yeah , I 'm sure . professor b: and and and it 's so I phd e: You 're saying r sort of remove the high level constraints and go bottom - up . Maybe there 's there 's even a better way to do it but it but but that 's , you know , sort of a traditional way of describing these things , phd e:   professor b: and  , actually this might be a g neat thing to talk to postdoc g: That 's nice . professor b: some sort of categories but but something that allows for overlapping change of these things and then this would give some more ground work for people who were building statistical models that allowed for overlapping changes , different timing changes as opposed to just \" click , you 're now in this state , which corresponds to this speech sound \" and so on . phd a: So this is like gestural  , these g professor b: Yeah , something like that . professor b: actually if we get into that it might be good to , haul John Ohala into this phd a: Right . phd a: But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data , postdoc g: Excellent . phd a: like so that you can do far field studies of those gestures or  , or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ? Or ? professor b: No , I think I think it 's for for for that purpose I 'm just viewing meetings as being a a neat way to get people talking naturally . And then you have i and then and then it 's natural in all senses , phd e: Just a source of data ? phd a: I see . professor b: in the sense that you have microphones that are at a distance that you know , one might have , and you have the close mikes , and you have people talking naturally . And the overlap is just indicative of the fact that people are talking naturally , phd a:  - huh . professor b: right ? So so I think that given that it 's that kind of corpus , phd d: Yeah . professor b: if it 's gonna be a very useful corpus  , if you say w OK , we 've limited the use by some of our , censored choices , we don't have the video , we don't and so forth , but there 's a lot of use that we could make of it by expanding the annotation choices . professor b: And , most of the things we 've talked about have been fairly high level , and being kind of a bottom - up person I thought maybe we 'd , do some of the others . professor b: people have made a lot of use of of TIMIT and ,  w due to its markings , and then the Switchboard transcription thing , well I think has been very useful for a lot of people . professor b: So phd a: I guess I wanted to , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings . phd a: I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , \" well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow professor b: Yeah . Go to their meeting tomorrow and see if we can try , to convince them postdoc g:   professor b: Cuz they have something like three or four different meetings , phd a: because they have And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here professor b: right ? postdoc g:    phd e: You mean in terms of the topic topics ? phd a: Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things and , just dialogue - wise , professor b:   And then the other thing is , I don't know if this is at all useful , but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch , professor b: Yes . grad h: You mean non - ICSI ? phd a: non - ICSI , non - academic , grad h: Yeah , I guess you you can try phd a: you know , like government people , grad h: but phd a: I don't know .  , it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches grad h: Well , tha I think that 's her point . phd a: Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings postdoc g: Yeah . phd e: Does does John Ohala have weekly phonetics lab meetings ? postdoc g:   grad h: And I think , if we could get phd a: So I actually wrote to him and he answered , \" great , that sounds really interesting \" . grad h: But , it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording phd a: So grad h: so u I didn't have to do it each time . phd a: and I was thinking professor b: He - he 's supposed he 's supposed to be trained to do it .  , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging , grad h: It 's not that hard . phd a: disfluency tagging , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling . So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , \" well \" , and that \" well \" is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .  , and things like that , th postdoc g: Of course some of that can be li done lexically . phd a: A lot of it can be done postdoc g: And I also they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already . phd a: I think there 's a second pass and I don't really know what would exist in it . But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not , postdoc g:   postdoc g: I wanted to whi while we 're  , so , to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data ,  I have two questions . One of them is , Jerry Feldman 's group , they they , are they I know that they recorded one meeting . professor b: I think there 's we should go beyond , ICSI but , there 's a lot of stuff happening at ICSI that we 're not getting now that we could . So th there was the thing in Fillmore 's group but even there he hadn't What he 'd said \" no \" to was for the main meeting . phd e: Well , and and the other thing too is when they originally said \" no \" they didn't know about this post - editing capability thing . professor b: there 's there 's , the networks group , I don't Do they still meeting regularly or ? grad h: Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not but they are no longer recording . professor b: But  , ha ha have they said they don't want to anymore or ? grad h: ugh , what was his name ? professor b: i i postdoc g: Joe Sokol ? grad h: Yeah . professor b: OK , so they 're down to three or four people grad h: They and they stopped Yeah . postdoc g: We might be able to get the administration grad h: Well he was sort of my contact , so I just need to find out who 's running it now . phd a: Yeah , it One thing that would be nice postdoc g: I don't know phd a: and this it sounds bizarre but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion , like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that . Some group , \" yes , we must \" grad h: Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ? phd a: Well , you know , something phd c: Yeah . grad f: Yeah , I don't think the more political argumentative ones would be willing to phd a:  professor b: Yeah , with with with potential use from the defense department . phd a: No , but maybe stu student , groups or , film - makers , or som Something a little bit colorful . Yeah , th there 's a problem there in terms of , the  commercial value of of st  , postdoc g: Yeah , of course there is this problem though , that if we give them the chance to excise later we e might end up with like five minutes out of a f of m one hour phd d: Film - maker . phd a: And I don't mean that they 're angry phd d: Is postdoc g: of Yes . phd a: but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat . So if anyone has ideas , I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing . postdoc g: Well there was this K P F A grad h: No that 's postdoc g: but OK . phd a: Or postdoc g: And I had one other one other aspect of this which is , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar  y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers . phd e: Did he mean ,  did he mean and non - British ? grad h: Well phd c: The all native . phd e: He said British was OK ? postdoc g: But but Sure , sure , sure . professor b: Why ? grad h: British is English ? phd c:  postdoc g: Yeah . professor b: Well , I don't I don't I don't think if he didn't say that postdoc g: Native speaking . grad h: So , why would he care ? phd e: Knowing the application phd a: That 's professor b: I remember wh I I remember a study phd a: I was thinking , knowing the , n National Institute of Standards , it is all professor b: I remember a study that BBN did where they trained on this was in Wall Street Journal days or something , they trained on American English and then they tested on , different native speakers from different areas . professor b: it was Swiss w Yeah , so it 's so I think , you know , if he 's if he 's thinking in terms of recognition kind of technology I I I think he would probably want ,  American English , postdoc g: All America , OK . It it yeah , unless we 're gonna train with a whole bunch of postdoc g: I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way , aren't they ?  , I sort of feel like they have professor b: I think so , grad h: Maybe . grad h: And maybe there are a few of with us where it was professor b: Yeah . grad h: you know , Dan wasn't there and before Jose started coming , professor b: Yeah . professor b: So , what about what about people who involved in some artistic endeavor ? phd d: Yeah . phd a: Exactly , that 's what I was professor b: You 'd think like they would be phd d: A film - maker . phd a: something where there there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing . phd a: Yeah , we could phd e: A any department that calls itself science phd d: Department . phd d: Computer sci grad h: That postdoc g: We could get Julia Child . phd a: I 'm I 'm actually serious grad h: That 's phd a: because , you know , we have the set up here grad h: Got a ticket . grad f: I know grad h: I could phd a: Not not professor b: Put a little ad up saying , \" come here and argue \" . grad h: and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech . grad h: But when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff , so . phd a: Or people who are really h professor b: They could have a discussion about te grad f: I grad h: We should probably bleep that out . grad f: I heard that at Cal Tech they have a special room someone said that they had a special room to get all your frustrations out that you can go to and like throw things and break things . professor b: Yeah , now that is not actually what we grad f: So we can like post a grad h: Th - that 's not what we want . grad f: No , not to that extent phd a: Well , far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall . professor b: Yeah , but we don't want them to throw the far field mikes is the thing . postdoc g: It 'd be fun to get like a a p visit from the grad h: There was a dorm room at Tech that , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , the floor with mattresses . professor b: What did we mean by that ? Remember @ @ ? grad h: Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing . phd a: Well I think that that was just sort of I I already asked Thilo professor b: Oh , you already did that . phd a: but that , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , people who are doing any kind of post - processing , whether it 's to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition .  , so , i is that Who else is work I guess Dan Ellis and you phd c: Dan , yeah . professor b: he 's he 's interested in in fact we 're look starting to look at some echo cancellation kind of things . professor b: Which  grad h: I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes , professor b:  ? grad h: but who knows ? professor b: Well , let 's w i isn't that what what you want phd a: I don't know . I 'm bad professor b: t No , so No , i w wha what you what you want when you 're saying improving the wave form you want the close talking microphone to be better . professor b: And the question is to w to what extent is it getting hurt by ,  by any room acoustics or is it just  , given that it 's close it 's not a problem ? phd a: It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear professor b:  phd a: but I 'm not an expert . grad h: e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , room acoustic phd a: That that may be true . phd a: But I don't know how good it can get either by those the those methods grad h: Yeah . grad h: So I I think it 's just , phd a: Oh , I don't know . phd a: All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , techniques . phd e: So the problem is like , on the microphone of somebody who 's not talking they 're picking up signals from other people and that 's causing problems ? phd a: R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K because the t no one transcribed any words there and we throw it out . phd a: But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time , so you get some speech and then a \"  -  \" , and some more speech , so that whole thing is one chunk . And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it , that 's where it 's a big problem . postdoc g: You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well , the encoding of the phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: And and he also , he was phd a: The energy , phd d: Yeah , phd a: right . postdoc g: I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events . Because , eh , it 's possible , eh , eh , in a simp sample view , to , nnn , to compare with c with the segment , the the kind of assessment what happened with the the different parameters . And only with a different bands of color for the , few situation , eh , I consider for acoustic event is enough to @ @ . phd d: I I I see that , eh , you are considering now , eh , a very sophisticated , eh , ehm , eh , @ @ set of , eh , graphic s eh , eh , ehm , si symbols to to transcribe . No ? Because , before , you you are talking about the the possibility to include in the Transcriber program eh , a set of symbols , of graphic symbol to t to mark the different situations during the transcription postdoc g: Oh , I w  - huh . No ? postdoc g: Well , you 're saying So , symbols for differences between laugh , and sigh , and and and slam the door and stuff ? phd d: Yeah . postdoc g: Or some other kind of thing ? phd d: No ? To to mark postdoc g: Well , I wouldn't say symbols so much . The the main change that I that I see in the interface is is just that we 'll be able to more finely c  , time things . postdoc g: But I I also st there was another aspect of your work that I was thinking about when I was talking to you phd a:  . postdoc g: which is that it sounded to me , Liz , as though you and , maybe I didn't q understand this , but it sounded to me as though part of the analysis that you 're doing involves taking segments which are of a particular type and putting them together . postdoc g: And th so if you have like a p a s you know , speech from one speaker , then you cut out the part that 's not that speaker , phd a:   postdoc g: and you combine segments from that same speaker to and run them through the recognizer . Is that right ? phd a: Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker , postdoc g:   phd a: because then we we 're more guaranteed that the recognizer will for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries , because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features . phd a: And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .  , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio , postdoc g:   phd a: which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel , or to have very to have closer , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech that gets transcribed in it , or both . So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good . And then the issue of like global processing of some signal and then , you know , before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that .

        "lynne neagle am: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's Children, Young People and Education Committee. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees\u2014pupils who are eligible for free school meals. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to\u2014in challenge advisers' discussions in schools\u2014we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that, 'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.' Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school\u2014it's an ethos for the whole school\u2014but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible\u00a0for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that, then, has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals. So, growth mindset; it may be attachment disorder training for staff, for instance, where we know it's of benefit to everybody, but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students. With regard to more able and talented, you know, Llyr, that this is an area of concern for me, generally, within the Welsh education system; that we've not been particularly good at identifying, supporting and driving attainment for those children. I'm absolutely clear that PDG needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential, whatever the potential of that child is, including more able and talented. And again, I'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in Pembrokeshire: a window on the world bus, again paid for by schools. kirsty williams am: Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world. And, again, that's very much targeted at raising aspirations and giving children who are more able and talented, who are eligible for PDG, those experiences,\u00a0and to really push them. So, yes, I'm absolutely clear that PDG shouldn't just be seen to be getting individuals to the average. For those children who are more able and talented, it should be used to support them\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that\u00a0it is being used properly? kirsty williams am: I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions. llyr gruffydd am: So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target? kirsty williams am: Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that\u00a0we've got at present. Some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands, so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit, for instance, we've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need, going forward. We haven't had any additional resource as a result of this, but we're very mindful that, potentially, this has an impact, going forward. And, officials are working all of the time, I must say, in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that\u00a0there will be a full public consultation on that. Finally for now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that\u00a0group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering\u00a0whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work.\u00a0So, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6\u00a0concept, but as an 'Ever 2' concept. We have looked at Ever 6,\u00a0and I'm going to be absolutely blunt with you: to introduce an Ever 6\u00a0concept for Wales would mean in the region of identifying an additional \u00a340 million. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional \u00a340 million to introduce an Ever 6. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years. darren millar am: It's just a very brief point in response to the \u00a340 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG,\u00a0yes? So, if you reduced the level of PDG slightly, but made it available to more individuals, if you like, via allocating it in a different way, then that \u00a340 million price ticket wouldn't be there, would it? kirsty williams am: I was asked a question about had I ever\u00a0considered an Ever 6. We could, indeed, change the way in which we allocate PDG money, but we have to do it within the envelope that is available to me, over \u00a390 million. That's a significant level of investment, but, of course, as always, Darren, we could cut the amount per pupil, but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done\u2014because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say, 'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.'\u00a0Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying, 'We're\u00a0not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,'\u00a0because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say, 'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.' darren millar am: Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have? kirsty williams am: We've\u2014 ruth conway: Sorry\u2014I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition,\u00a0and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that 'the majority of schools are making\u00a0well thought out and appropriate decisions' on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds\u00a0of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding? kirsty williams am: Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it\u2014that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn\u00a0has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools\u00a0it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children, and to have a system in place. So we've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning. We're also seeing from Estyn that, actually, in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works, Estyn says that PDG is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money. But clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be, and again we come back to the decision I've made to appoint regional PDG advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach. We are, in the discussions that I have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage, looking for very clear evidence of schools using the Sutton Trust toolkit, and we could have a discussion about whether that's the right thing, because that's on my mind too. But we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base, and if they're not, if a school isn't doing that, okay, so demonstrate to us why you've made those decisions and, crucially, what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils. So, if you're moving away from tried and tested interventions, what we know works, if you're doing something different with your money, okay, you need to justify that and you need to explain how you're going to demonstrate impact. But I think what we're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the PDG develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops. llyr gruffydd am: You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding. kirsty williams am: No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been\u2014well, I suppose it is\u00a0the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools. llyr gruffydd am: So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on. kirsty williams am: As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that. mark reckless am: Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals? kirsty williams am: I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance,\u00a0but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said, 'We recognised we had a problem with attendance. We tried a variety of means of improving that, but in the end we have taken this quite bold step\u2014we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus, and they walk the children into school'. They say that they know that, for some of those children, because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in, they probably wouldn't be in school if it wasn't for that proactive approach. So, we're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance, because although, again, there are examples of good practice, there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils. And, of course, we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching, but unless the children are in the classes then we're not going to make the difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children. mark reckless am: I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative. kirsty williams am: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. steve davies: There is also another very good example\u2014and I take what you say about where there are small numbers\u2014but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals? kirsty williams am: So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think\u00a0what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency approach to supporting that particular child. Some of those exclusions can be as a result of the need to address other issues going on in a child's life. So, this is where we come back to the committee's work, for instance, on mental health and support for children, support for behaviour in school. So, again, it's a multi-agency approach that I think we need, and, in our good schools, our really, really good schools, there's a recognition of that need to have a whole team around a child to support that child in education. So, for those children who do find themselves in education other than at school, we are providing additional support that previously was not available. hefin david am: It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. So, if you look at it\u2014with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer\u2014on the face of it, the gap has increased. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus\u2014one in five\u2014by 2016, we had got that down to one in three. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but, Sir Alasdair, who knows about these things, says that that is a significant improvement.\u00a0Last year, we got some challenges. We need to understand why that happened, but I do think it's\u2014 hefin david am: Why, do you think? kirsty williams am: Why, do I think?\u00a0What I do think is there is no one answer. I think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from BTEC to science GCSEs. I think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who weren't doing a single science GCSE and are now doing science GCSEs. Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy\u00a0in all its forms that I think\u00a0could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject. hefin david am: So, to what extent would exam\u00a0boards be responsible for lack of grade stability? kirsty williams am: It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children. hefin david am: Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns? kirsty williams am: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again,\u00a0Hefin,\u00a0what we've got to be clear on is\u2014while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic\u2014we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city\u2014so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium\u2014you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents.",
        " For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years' time, when we will be looking back in two years' time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way? kirsty williams am: Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure anyway because of the\u2014 hefin david am: So, what performance measures will you use? kirsty williams am: So, for the lack of sophistication around the level 2 plus, and for the unintended behaviours that that particular performance measure has driven within our schools. What's important to me is that we have a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. What level 2 plus does is narrow, very much, the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort, usually the C/D borderline, which is why then we have problems with the number of students getting a B grade or above. Well, if a child gets a C but came to you in year 7 and they were destined to get an E, yes, indeed, a C is a success, because you've moved that child on; but, if that child came to you destined to get an A* and gets a C, then we haven't done a good job by that particular child. So, we need a performance measure that is much more sophisticated, looks at each individual child, tracks that progress, and measures the value added by that school in performance. hefin david am: Last question: therefore, should we have confidence in the data up to 2016? Is there a lack of confidence in that data? kirsty williams am: No, it's not a lack of confidence in the data. What I'm saying is, using that as a performance measure and an accountability measure within our school system may have been right for the time. I think that particular set of performance measures has driven certain behaviours\u2014not because Ministers wanted that to happen, but as an unintended consequence. I think we can work together with our school system, learning the lessons of international best practice, to develop much more sophisticated accountability and performance measures for individual schools, and, I should say, for the Government. So, you will be aware of my intention to issue the first national report card on Government performance later on this year. It's about trying to develop a more sophisticated way, which is in line with our national mission, where every child's education is valued, and where the impact of the school can be tracked more effectively. Can I just ask, Cabinet Secretary, are you still holding on to your target of 37 per cent of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold? kirsty williams am: Well, we're moving away from the level 2 threshold. So, we will want to develop a new suite, in line with our new accountability\u00a0measures, as we go forward.\u00a0So, we will be absolutely continuing to track and evaluate the performance of free-school-meal pupils. When we announce our new accountability measures, I will be in a position to address how we'll measure\u00a0the Government's\u00a0performance, and national performance, going forward. But, given the fact that we're moving\u00a0away from level 2 plus, then we will need a different set of performance\u00a0indicators. The next questions are on looked-after children and adopted children, and I've got questions from Michelle then Mark. mark reckless am: I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children\u00a0doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility\u00a0as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey\u2014only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary\u00a0schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder\u2014can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia\u00a0in this field? kirsty williams am: Okay. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. My understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment\u00a0of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it\u00a0was being used previously. We have looked-after children PDG co-ordinators\u2014they're in their second year this year\u2014to look at a regional deployment of that resource. And that resource can be done in a variety of ways, through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child, through to capacity building\u00a0for the whole system. So, for instance, if I give you an example, in Carmarthenshire, there's been a big emphasis on attachment\u00a0disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder. Carmarthenshire happens\u00a0to be one of those local authorities\u00a0that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children. But I have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year. Steve, on my behalf, wrote out to the system, setting out our expectations, but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money. So, what has that money\u00a0been used on and how can you account for the effect? But, Steve, maybe you can give some greater detail. One of the rationales\u00a0for shifting\u2014not that all the money stays in the region, but having a regional strategic\u00a0support\u2014was that, historically, the money was going directly\u00a0with that child to the school. Given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools\u2014the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents\u2014historically, what happened, the money lands in the school, because, at that time in the year, when it's measured, the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff, but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money\u00a0doesn't transfer. Some schools will go through quite a number of years without having\u00a0a looked-after child and will not think strategically, 'How do I need to support them?' So, that was the rationale of the shift. In terms\u00a0of the implementation of the regional allocation, as of this financial year finishing, we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they've located the resource, what the impact of that resource has been, so that is reinforced\u00a0and shared more widely. kirsty williams am: And then, to reassure, it's not just internally that we're looking at this. We have a contract with an external agency to do an evaluation\u2014 mark reckless am: That's ICF consulting. Yes, so that was done in the autumn of last year, because, as I said, we had concerns about whether this was really having the effect that was intended. So, my expectation is that we will be in a position to receive that report later on this spring, and of course it would be my intention that that report would be made public for people to have a look at what\u2014 mark reckless am: That was commissioned last autumn\u2014 kirsty williams am: Yes, in November 2017. kirsty williams am: So, I'm hoping to have that published before the summer recess. I'm very reluctant to say months; I've learnt not to say months, because they move. lynne neagle am: I'm going to go to Michelle now, Mark, because\u2014 mark reckless am: Sure. lynne neagle am: \u2014both of you asked for these questions, and that's what the pre-meeting is for. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date? kirsty williams am: As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of, 'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family, 'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.' lynne neagle am: Michelle. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners in general. What are your views on that approach? kirsty williams am: I'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners, we'll be getting it right for all of our learners. I gave the example earlier, for instance, of attachment disorder, and, Chair, you will know that I have had conversations. One of the emerging themes for me, as I go around visiting schools, is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder, and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children. So, for instance, as I said about Carmarthenshire, there's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in Carmarthenshire. Now, that has a disproportionate benefit for those children, because you're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced, because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived, but that doesn't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after. So, that vulnerable learner, regardless of their background, will benefit from having teachers who are better trained, understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need. steve davies: I think it's also important to add that this is not one region's approach; this is across four regions, so the others\u2014. For example, ERW have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils, which has\u00a0enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies. kirsty williams am: I was in Pil\u00a0Primary School recently where they use their PDG, both FSM PDG, and no doubt an element of PDG for\u00a0looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a\u00a0better position to learn. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data.\u00a0Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who\u00a0were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so? kirsty williams am: We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support\u2014even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas\u2014. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying, 'Actually,\u00a0this will mean more money for your child's school budget'\u00a0is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying, 'Actually, it's going to help you',\u00a0because they don't want to be seen being dependent, they don't want to be seen being helped.\u00a0But, if you say to them, 'Actually,\u00a0do you know that this means more money for your child's school?', they go, 'Oh, all right then, I'll fill in the forms now.'\u00a0So, you're right, I think there is something that we could do to make parents understand, in the round, that this has an impact. But we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing. One of the things I am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can, across Government, work more closely together. We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone.\u00a0And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement,\u00a0where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school\u2014when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think, 'Oh\u00a0my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?'\u00a0If you can imagine, the school could have been working really, really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place, to get them being able to access the curriculum, and then social services decide that the placement is being changed. So, a greater involvement in education\u00a0and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this. If we think we can crack this with just PDG, then we're being delusional. It has to be a cross-government approach at a national level, and at a local government level as well, to get this right. Sometimes, data protection\u2014how can we break down some of these barriers between, you know, the school doesn't need to, schools shouldn't see, the entire social services report? Well, maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they're going to have an impact for that child.\u00a0So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children. julie morgan am: Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. kirsty williams am: Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again\u2014and I've said this a lot\u2014after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. Can you expand on that and what effect the PDG has had in this result, or not had? kirsty williams am: Well,\u00a0there's no getting away from it: the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children, the results are not good enough. That's why officials are engaging with the group that David Melding is chairing, to make sure that education is integral to that group and it's not lost sight of. There's a discussion to be had about the cohort, whether it's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort, or whether these statistics are useful in any way. Sometimes as well\u2014this is not to make an excuse because, as I've said in my paper, it's extremely disappointing, but sometimes it can be really difficult. Because the cohort sometimes can be very, very small, it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic. julie morgan am: I think, generally, when you look at how looked-after children do\u2014 kirsty williams am: It's not good. julie morgan am: \u2014in\u00a0a much wider evaluation, they're not doing well, are they? kirsty williams am: They're not doing well. So, that's why we've got the review, the independent review, into the impact of the PDG in this area. This is why Steve is doing the work that he is doing with the regional consortia because, clearly, at the moment, we are not doing what we need to do for that particular cohort of children. steve davies: I think we will not move away from the fact that these children need good GCSEs to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and\u00a0still hold on to the fact\u00a0that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions? kirsty williams am: We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that\u00a0our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission\u2014to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school. I was just wondering what your assessment\u00a0is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't. kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. I think, talking to those involved\u00a0in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because\u2014 kirsty williams am: Leadership is all. I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage. llyr gruffydd am: The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda? kirsty williams am: Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia.\u00a0It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school?\u00a0We're looking at the teacher quality\u2014how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity\u2014again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools.",
        " So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools\u2014but that expertise is available to all our schools. llyr gruffydd am: Although Estyn\u00a0has told us, of course, that you can't expect the consortia to\u00a0really carry on with that level of intervention and the same kind of intensity as was provided previously, so I'm just wondering\u2014 kirsty williams am: In what way? llyr gruffydd am: Well, we were told by Estyn\u00a0in evidence that they didn't necessarily think that we could expect the consortia to provide the same type of tailored support, and certainly the level of intensity with the improvement boards and everything\u2014 kirsty williams am: Well, the improvement boards are carrying on, so the improvement boards still exist, and I would\u2014not that I want to argue with Estyn\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Well, feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you\u2014 kirsty williams am: What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme,\u00a0which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr,\u00a0in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements. llyr gruffydd am: So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back. kirsty williams am: Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again\u2014gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down, but what we have seen is investment via Schools Challenge Cymru,\u00a0but ongoing, continual support from the regional consortium, and that school has come out of special measures. I pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job. So, I'm absolutely convinced that where we've got good\u00a0leadership and good support,\u00a0some of those schools are making continued, sustained progress even after the end of the programme. The challenge for me is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and we haven't seen that progress\u2014how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference. So that's what my focus is on now: a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support, when we recognise that there are schools everywhere, potentially, that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of\u2014well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have. kirsty williams am: What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over \u00a310 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work. llyr gruffydd am: So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department? kirsty williams am: Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that. llyr gruffydd am: Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had? kirsty williams am: Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about\u2014Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon\u2014I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take\u2014. I always take the opportunity to speak to those teachers about their experience of the programme and to understand and assure myself that they are getting ongoing support that they see as an appropriate level for them. hefin david am: With regard to it being a time-limited programme, the previous Minister was clear that it was a time-limited programme, but it wasn't quite as time-limited as you've decided to be. Is that fair to say? kirsty williams am: No, it was supposed to be a three-year programme at the most. So, there's no differential between when I decided it was time-limited and the expectations\u2014 hefin david am: So the time limit was the same that the previous Minister put on it. llyr gruffydd am: But Mel Ainscow did tell us that there was a fade out in that third year\u2014not that people were giving up, don't get me wrong, but clearly there wasn't that commitment coming from Government because the decision had been made, and people felt that it was just fizzling out a little bit, and that impacted on the momentum. I think there certainly was a transition phase when we knew that the programme was moving and schools were moving into a different level of support,\u00a0but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fading out\u2014not at all. As I said, we were aware that the programme was transitioning and we were determined to get that right for those individual schools, and to learn the lessons and, crucially, to be able to apply those lessons right across the board. steve davies: I can see where the perception would come if a programme director like Mel was managing the programme right to the end of the three years exactly the same, and it falls off\u2014not a cliff, but it falls off, then the readiness for schools and the readiness in the system to hand over\u2014so part of the shift of focus was that working as a Government with the programme in those schools to working with the programme, those schools and the region. So, I think, inevitably, one party might see it as a decrease in terms of emphasis on their work, but it was necessary for the transition. llyr gruffydd am: But does that cast a bit of a shadow over the transition, then\u2014that one key player within that process felt as such, or are you confident that that was managed well and effectively? kirsty williams am: I think it was managed well, and we were very clear to recognise success where success has been achieved, but not to gloss over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference\u00a0and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us. lynne neagle am: Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia? kirsty williams am: Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know. kirsty williams am: And can I just say, I met with some of them? I met with a selection of those people who had been involved in the programme to get their feedback on what they felt had gone right, and what they didn't feel had gone right in the programme. So, I took the time not just to meet the figurehead\u00a0of the programme, but actually to meet the people who were doing the work in the individual schools. darren millar am: Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the figurehead there, I assume by 'the figurehead' you mean Professor Ainscow. And you've mentioned as well that you said you wanted to learn lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru, but he told us that nobody had been in touch with him since March of last year in order to have any sort of follow-up engagement, or to have a dialogue about his perspective on what worked, what didn't work, why there were failures in some areas and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme? kirsty williams am: I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. darren millar am: But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow\u2014with Professor Ainscow himself. steve davies: I would actually say that I have had meetings\u2014 darren millar am: Since March of last year. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and discussions. darren millar am: So, when he told us, 'Since last March, I literally have had no contact at all with anybody from Welsh Government', he was telling porky pies, was he? steve davies: That's not my recollection. kirsty williams am: Yes, well, I just talked about the celebration event to formally mark the end of the programme. And this idea that somebody has been ignored or frozen out is not how I see or how I regard that situation. mark reckless am: I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia.\u00a0I just wonder,\u00a0Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area. kirsty williams am: Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual. kirsty williams am: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him,\u00a0Owen Evans\u00a0has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you\u2014and I'm absolutely confident\u2014is that we\u00a0have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia\u2014. mark reckless am: I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him\u00a0individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a\u00a0desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers\u00a0being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about?\u00a0Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government to help in this area. kirsty williams am: Firstly, can I say that I have never described the programme as a failure? I would understand, as someone who has put so much personal investment into the brand of schools challenges, that he would not want anybody to characterise that particular approach to school improvement as a failure. And I want to be absolutely clear that I have never described the programme as a failure, and I want to reassure Mr Ainscow of that. As I've said, gosh, my goodness me, if you saw my e-mail inbox and you saw the letters that come in, people are never shy\u00a0in coming forward to give me advice on what I need to do, what I need to do next, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and, you know, our doors are always open to listen to people who have interesting things to say about how we can deliver our educational mission. I'm sure the Minister is aware that Cardiff put extra funds of its own in to continue Schools Challenge Cymru advisers. So, obviously, they appreciated the value of the scheme, but it does query whether it should have gone on longer. kirsty williams am: Julie, I think, to be fair, there are some people who think the scheme was absolutely fantastic. I've had feedback from people who didn't think the scheme was helpful at all\u2014in fact, they felt it was a hindrance. I'm very much of the view that the scheme worked really well for some schools in some areas and had less impact\u00a0in some areas. What's important to me is that we understand what it was that led those schools to make those big changes, how we can\u2014like Mark talked about,\u00a0the expertise\u2014how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply\u00a0the lessons to all schools. john griffiths am: Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. john griffiths am: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual\u00a0school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region? kirsty williams am: I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there could sometimes be tensions between the two, but in most cases, the relationship was very, very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers. But I'm going to be blunt and honest with people\u2014in some cases, it has been reported to me\u2014it's only anecdotal evidence; I haven't got hard and fast evidence\u2014that there sometimes was a conflict: 'We're a school challenge school so we don't need to participate or listen to any advice that's coming from the regional consortia.' Or, a local education authority said to me, 'We felt that we couldn't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme.' Those were isolated incidents, and, as I said, it's only anecdotal feedback. steve davies: Just very quickly, I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting\u2014[Inaudible.]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them\u2014and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this\u2014it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions\u2014I can't remember which ones\u2014so he's established relationships\u2014[Interruption.] Sorry? kirsty williams am: Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working. kirsty williams am: Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes\u2014for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent\u00a0monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members\u2014you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG\u2014because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record\u2014can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken? kirsty williams am: Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance, absolutely crucial? That's the bedrock. We don't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school. There are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this, but we are absolutely clear, and best practice and evidence shows us, that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial. And, as I said in the beginning, where we weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. Again, one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt, was, again, the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. lynne neagle am: Okay, and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, updating us on the supply teacher issue. Paper to note 3\u2014another letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, providing further information following our meeting on 15 February. And paper to note 6 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales, following up on the dialogue that they've been having about our inquiry. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting"

        "lynne neagle am: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's Children, Young People and Education Committee. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees\u2014pupils who are eligible for free school meals. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to\u2014in challenge advisers' discussions in schools\u2014we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that, 'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.' Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school\u2014it's an ethos for the whole school\u2014but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible\u00a0for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that, then, has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals. So, growth mindset; it may be attachment disorder training for staff, for instance, where we know it's of benefit to everybody, but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students. With regard to more able and talented, you know, Llyr, that this is an area of concern for me, generally, within the Welsh education system; that we've not been particularly good at identifying, supporting and driving attainment for those children. I'm absolutely clear that PDG needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential, whatever the potential of that child is, including more able and talented. And again, I'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in Pembrokeshire: a window on the world bus, again paid for by schools. kirsty williams am: Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world. And, again, that's very much targeted at raising aspirations and giving children who are more able and talented, who are eligible for PDG, those experiences,\u00a0and to really push them. So, yes, I'm absolutely clear that PDG shouldn't just be seen to be getting individuals to the average. For those children who are more able and talented, it should be used to support them\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that\u00a0it is being used properly? kirsty williams am: I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions. llyr gruffydd am: So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target? kirsty williams am: Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that\u00a0we've got at present. Some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands, so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit, for instance, we've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need, going forward. We haven't had any additional resource as a result of this, but we're very mindful that, potentially, this has an impact, going forward. And, officials are working all of the time, I must say, in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that\u00a0there will be a full public consultation on that. Finally for now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that\u00a0group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering\u00a0whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work.\u00a0So, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6\u00a0concept, but as an 'Ever 2' concept. We have looked at Ever 6,\u00a0and I'm going to be absolutely blunt with you: to introduce an Ever 6\u00a0concept for Wales would mean in the region of identifying an additional \u00a340 million. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional \u00a340 million to introduce an Ever 6. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years. darren millar am: It's just a very brief point in response to the \u00a340 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG,\u00a0yes? So, if you reduced the level of PDG slightly, but made it available to more individuals, if you like, via allocating it in a different way, then that \u00a340 million price ticket wouldn't be there, would it? kirsty williams am: I was asked a question about had I ever\u00a0considered an Ever 6. We could, indeed, change the way in which we allocate PDG money, but we have to do it within the envelope that is available to me, over \u00a390 million. That's a significant level of investment, but, of course, as always, Darren, we could cut the amount per pupil, but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done\u2014because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say, 'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.'\u00a0Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying, 'We're\u00a0not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,'\u00a0because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say, 'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.' darren millar am: Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have? kirsty williams am: We've\u2014 ruth conway: Sorry\u2014I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition,\u00a0and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that 'the majority of schools are making\u00a0well thought out and appropriate decisions' on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds\u00a0of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding? kirsty williams am: Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it\u2014that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn\u00a0has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools\u00a0it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children, and to have a system in place. So we've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning. We're also seeing from Estyn that, actually, in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works, Estyn says that PDG is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money. But clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be, and again we come back to the decision I've made to appoint regional PDG advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach. We are, in the discussions that I have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage, looking for very clear evidence of schools using the Sutton Trust toolkit, and we could have a discussion about whether that's the right thing, because that's on my mind too. But we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base, and if they're not, if a school isn't doing that, okay, so demonstrate to us why you've made those decisions and, crucially, what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils. So, if you're moving away from tried and tested interventions, what we know works, if you're doing something different with your money, okay, you need to justify that and you need to explain how you're going to demonstrate impact. But I think what we're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the PDG develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops. llyr gruffydd am: You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding. kirsty williams am: No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been\u2014well, I suppose it is\u00a0the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools. llyr gruffydd am: So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on. kirsty williams am: As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that. mark reckless am: Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals? kirsty williams am: I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance,\u00a0but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said, 'We recognised we had a problem with attendance. We tried a variety of means of improving that, but in the end we have taken this quite bold step\u2014we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus, and they walk the children into school'. They say that they know that, for some of those children, because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in, they probably wouldn't be in school if it wasn't for that proactive approach. So, we're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance, because although, again, there are examples of good practice, there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils. And, of course, we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching, but unless the children are in the classes then we're not going to make the difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children. mark reckless am: I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative. kirsty williams am: Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. steve davies: There is also another very good example\u2014and I take what you say about where there are small numbers\u2014but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals? kirsty williams am: So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think\u00a0what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency approach to supporting that particular child. Some of those exclusions can be as a result of the need to address other issues going on in a child's life. So, this is where we come back to the committee's work, for instance, on mental health and support for children, support for behaviour in school. So, again, it's a multi-agency approach that I think we need, and, in our good schools, our really, really good schools, there's a recognition of that need to have a whole team around a child to support that child in education. So, for those children who do find themselves in education other than at school, we are providing additional support that previously was not available. hefin david am: It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. So, if you look at it\u2014with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer\u2014on the face of it, the gap has increased. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus\u2014one in five\u2014by 2016, we had got that down to one in three. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but, Sir Alasdair, who knows about these things, says that that is a significant improvement.\u00a0Last year, we got some challenges. We need to understand why that happened, but I do think it's\u2014 hefin david am: Why, do you think? kirsty williams am: Why, do I think?\u00a0What I do think is there is no one answer. I think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from BTEC to science GCSEs. I think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who weren't doing a single science GCSE and are now doing science GCSEs. Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy\u00a0in all its forms that I think\u00a0could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject. hefin david am: So, to what extent would exam\u00a0boards be responsible for lack of grade stability? kirsty williams am: It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children. hefin david am: Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns? kirsty williams am: I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again,\u00a0Hefin,\u00a0what we've got to be clear on is\u2014while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic\u2014we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city\u2014so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium\u2014you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents.",
        " For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years' time, when we will be looking back in two years' time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way? kirsty williams am: Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure anyway because of the\u2014 hefin david am: So, what performance measures will you use? kirsty williams am: So, for the lack of sophistication around the level 2 plus, and for the unintended behaviours that that particular performance measure has driven within our schools. What's important to me is that we have a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. What level 2 plus does is narrow, very much, the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort, usually the C/D borderline, which is why then we have problems with the number of students getting a B grade or above. Well, if a child gets a C but came to you in year 7 and they were destined to get an E, yes, indeed, a C is a success, because you've moved that child on; but, if that child came to you destined to get an A* and gets a C, then we haven't done a good job by that particular child. So, we need a performance measure that is much more sophisticated, looks at each individual child, tracks that progress, and measures the value added by that school in performance. hefin david am: Last question: therefore, should we have confidence in the data up to 2016? Is there a lack of confidence in that data? kirsty williams am: No, it's not a lack of confidence in the data. What I'm saying is, using that as a performance measure and an accountability measure within our school system may have been right for the time. I think that particular set of performance measures has driven certain behaviours\u2014not because Ministers wanted that to happen, but as an unintended consequence. I think we can work together with our school system, learning the lessons of international best practice, to develop much more sophisticated accountability and performance measures for individual schools, and, I should say, for the Government. So, you will be aware of my intention to issue the first national report card on Government performance later on this year. It's about trying to develop a more sophisticated way, which is in line with our national mission, where every child's education is valued, and where the impact of the school can be tracked more effectively. Can I just ask, Cabinet Secretary, are you still holding on to your target of 37 per cent of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold? kirsty williams am: Well, we're moving away from the level 2 threshold. So, we will want to develop a new suite, in line with our new accountability\u00a0measures, as we go forward.\u00a0So, we will be absolutely continuing to track and evaluate the performance of free-school-meal pupils. When we announce our new accountability measures, I will be in a position to address how we'll measure\u00a0the Government's\u00a0performance, and national performance, going forward. But, given the fact that we're moving\u00a0away from level 2 plus, then we will need a different set of performance\u00a0indicators. The next questions are on looked-after children and adopted children, and I've got questions from Michelle then Mark. mark reckless am: I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children\u00a0doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility\u00a0as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey\u2014only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary\u00a0schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder\u2014can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia\u00a0in this field? kirsty williams am: Okay. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. My understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment\u00a0of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it\u00a0was being used previously. We have looked-after children PDG co-ordinators\u2014they're in their second year this year\u2014to look at a regional deployment of that resource. And that resource can be done in a variety of ways, through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child, through to capacity building\u00a0for the whole system. So, for instance, if I give you an example, in Carmarthenshire, there's been a big emphasis on attachment\u00a0disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder. Carmarthenshire happens\u00a0to be one of those local authorities\u00a0that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children. But I have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year. Steve, on my behalf, wrote out to the system, setting out our expectations, but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money. So, what has that money\u00a0been used on and how can you account for the effect? But, Steve, maybe you can give some greater detail. One of the rationales\u00a0for shifting\u2014not that all the money stays in the region, but having a regional strategic\u00a0support\u2014was that, historically, the money was going directly\u00a0with that child to the school. Given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools\u2014the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents\u2014historically, what happened, the money lands in the school, because, at that time in the year, when it's measured, the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff, but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money\u00a0doesn't transfer. Some schools will go through quite a number of years without having\u00a0a looked-after child and will not think strategically, 'How do I need to support them?' So, that was the rationale of the shift. In terms\u00a0of the implementation of the regional allocation, as of this financial year finishing, we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they've located the resource, what the impact of that resource has been, so that is reinforced\u00a0and shared more widely. kirsty williams am: And then, to reassure, it's not just internally that we're looking at this. We have a contract with an external agency to do an evaluation\u2014 mark reckless am: That's ICF consulting. Yes, so that was done in the autumn of last year, because, as I said, we had concerns about whether this was really having the effect that was intended. So, my expectation is that we will be in a position to receive that report later on this spring, and of course it would be my intention that that report would be made public for people to have a look at what\u2014 mark reckless am: That was commissioned last autumn\u2014 kirsty williams am: Yes, in November 2017. kirsty williams am: So, I'm hoping to have that published before the summer recess. I'm very reluctant to say months; I've learnt not to say months, because they move. lynne neagle am: I'm going to go to Michelle now, Mark, because\u2014 mark reckless am: Sure. lynne neagle am: \u2014both of you asked for these questions, and that's what the pre-meeting is for. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date? kirsty williams am: As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of, 'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family, 'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.' lynne neagle am: Michelle. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners in general. What are your views on that approach? kirsty williams am: I'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners, we'll be getting it right for all of our learners. I gave the example earlier, for instance, of attachment disorder, and, Chair, you will know that I have had conversations. One of the emerging themes for me, as I go around visiting schools, is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder, and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children. So, for instance, as I said about Carmarthenshire, there's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in Carmarthenshire. Now, that has a disproportionate benefit for those children, because you're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced, because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived, but that doesn't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after. So, that vulnerable learner, regardless of their background, will benefit from having teachers who are better trained, understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need. steve davies: I think it's also important to add that this is not one region's approach; this is across four regions, so the others\u2014. For example, ERW have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils, which has\u00a0enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies. kirsty williams am: I was in Pil\u00a0Primary School recently where they use their PDG, both FSM PDG, and no doubt an element of PDG for\u00a0looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a\u00a0better position to learn. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data.\u00a0Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who\u00a0were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so? kirsty williams am: We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support\u2014even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas\u2014. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying, 'Actually,\u00a0this will mean more money for your child's school budget'\u00a0is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying, 'Actually, it's going to help you',\u00a0because they don't want to be seen being dependent, they don't want to be seen being helped.\u00a0But, if you say to them, 'Actually,\u00a0do you know that this means more money for your child's school?', they go, 'Oh, all right then, I'll fill in the forms now.'\u00a0So, you're right, I think there is something that we could do to make parents understand, in the round, that this has an impact. But we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing. One of the things I am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can, across Government, work more closely together. We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone.\u00a0And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement,\u00a0where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school\u2014when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think, 'Oh\u00a0my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?'\u00a0If you can imagine, the school could have been working really, really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place, to get them being able to access the curriculum, and then social services decide that the placement is being changed. So, a greater involvement in education\u00a0and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this. If we think we can crack this with just PDG, then we're being delusional. It has to be a cross-government approach at a national level, and at a local government level as well, to get this right. Sometimes, data protection\u2014how can we break down some of these barriers between, you know, the school doesn't need to, schools shouldn't see, the entire social services report? Well, maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they're going to have an impact for that child.\u00a0So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children. julie morgan am: Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. kirsty williams am: Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again\u2014and I've said this a lot\u2014after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. Can you expand on that and what effect the PDG has had in this result, or not had? kirsty williams am: Well,\u00a0there's no getting away from it: the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children, the results are not good enough. That's why officials are engaging with the group that David Melding is chairing, to make sure that education is integral to that group and it's not lost sight of. There's a discussion to be had about the cohort, whether it's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort, or whether these statistics are useful in any way. Sometimes as well\u2014this is not to make an excuse because, as I've said in my paper, it's extremely disappointing, but sometimes it can be really difficult. Because the cohort sometimes can be very, very small, it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic. julie morgan am: I think, generally, when you look at how looked-after children do\u2014 kirsty williams am: It's not good. julie morgan am: \u2014in\u00a0a much wider evaluation, they're not doing well, are they? kirsty williams am: They're not doing well. So, that's why we've got the review, the independent review, into the impact of the PDG in this area. This is why Steve is doing the work that he is doing with the regional consortia because, clearly, at the moment, we are not doing what we need to do for that particular cohort of children. steve davies: I think we will not move away from the fact that these children need good GCSEs to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and\u00a0still hold on to the fact\u00a0that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions? kirsty williams am: We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that\u00a0our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission\u2014to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school. I was just wondering what your assessment\u00a0is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't. kirsty williams am: I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. I think, talking to those involved\u00a0in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because\u2014 kirsty williams am: Leadership is all. I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage. llyr gruffydd am: The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda? kirsty williams am: Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia.\u00a0It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school?\u00a0We're looking at the teacher quality\u2014how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity\u2014again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools.",
        " So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools\u2014but that expertise is available to all our schools. llyr gruffydd am: Although Estyn\u00a0has told us, of course, that you can't expect the consortia to\u00a0really carry on with that level of intervention and the same kind of intensity as was provided previously, so I'm just wondering\u2014 kirsty williams am: In what way? llyr gruffydd am: Well, we were told by Estyn\u00a0in evidence that they didn't necessarily think that we could expect the consortia to provide the same type of tailored support, and certainly the level of intensity with the improvement boards and everything\u2014 kirsty williams am: Well, the improvement boards are carrying on, so the improvement boards still exist, and I would\u2014not that I want to argue with Estyn\u2014 llyr gruffydd am: Well, feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you\u2014 kirsty williams am: What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme,\u00a0which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr,\u00a0in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements. llyr gruffydd am: So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back. kirsty williams am: Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again\u2014gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down, but what we have seen is investment via Schools Challenge Cymru,\u00a0but ongoing, continual support from the regional consortium, and that school has come out of special measures. I pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job. So, I'm absolutely convinced that where we've got good\u00a0leadership and good support,\u00a0some of those schools are making continued, sustained progress even after the end of the programme. The challenge for me is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and we haven't seen that progress\u2014how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference. So that's what my focus is on now: a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support, when we recognise that there are schools everywhere, potentially, that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of\u2014well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have. kirsty williams am: What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over \u00a310 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work. llyr gruffydd am: So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department? kirsty williams am: Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that. llyr gruffydd am: Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had? kirsty williams am: Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about\u2014Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon\u2014I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take\u2014. I always take the opportunity to speak to those teachers about their experience of the programme and to understand and assure myself that they are getting ongoing support that they see as an appropriate level for them. hefin david am: With regard to it being a time-limited programme, the previous Minister was clear that it was a time-limited programme, but it wasn't quite as time-limited as you've decided to be. Is that fair to say? kirsty williams am: No, it was supposed to be a three-year programme at the most. So, there's no differential between when I decided it was time-limited and the expectations\u2014 hefin david am: So the time limit was the same that the previous Minister put on it. llyr gruffydd am: But Mel Ainscow did tell us that there was a fade out in that third year\u2014not that people were giving up, don't get me wrong, but clearly there wasn't that commitment coming from Government because the decision had been made, and people felt that it was just fizzling out a little bit, and that impacted on the momentum. I think there certainly was a transition phase when we knew that the programme was moving and schools were moving into a different level of support,\u00a0but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fading out\u2014not at all. As I said, we were aware that the programme was transitioning and we were determined to get that right for those individual schools, and to learn the lessons and, crucially, to be able to apply those lessons right across the board. steve davies: I can see where the perception would come if a programme director like Mel was managing the programme right to the end of the three years exactly the same, and it falls off\u2014not a cliff, but it falls off, then the readiness for schools and the readiness in the system to hand over\u2014so part of the shift of focus was that working as a Government with the programme in those schools to working with the programme, those schools and the region. So, I think, inevitably, one party might see it as a decrease in terms of emphasis on their work, but it was necessary for the transition. llyr gruffydd am: But does that cast a bit of a shadow over the transition, then\u2014that one key player within that process felt as such, or are you confident that that was managed well and effectively? kirsty williams am: I think it was managed well, and we were very clear to recognise success where success has been achieved, but not to gloss over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference\u00a0and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us. lynne neagle am: Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia? kirsty williams am: Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know. kirsty williams am: And can I just say, I met with some of them? I met with a selection of those people who had been involved in the programme to get their feedback on what they felt had gone right, and what they didn't feel had gone right in the programme. So, I took the time not just to meet the figurehead\u00a0of the programme, but actually to meet the people who were doing the work in the individual schools. darren millar am: Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the figurehead there, I assume by 'the figurehead' you mean Professor Ainscow. And you've mentioned as well that you said you wanted to learn lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru, but he told us that nobody had been in touch with him since March of last year in order to have any sort of follow-up engagement, or to have a dialogue about his perspective on what worked, what didn't work, why there were failures in some areas and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme? kirsty williams am: I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. darren millar am: But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow\u2014with Professor Ainscow himself. steve davies: I would actually say that I have had meetings\u2014 darren millar am: Since March of last year. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and discussions. darren millar am: So, when he told us, 'Since last March, I literally have had no contact at all with anybody from Welsh Government', he was telling porky pies, was he? steve davies: That's not my recollection. kirsty williams am: Yes, well, I just talked about the celebration event to formally mark the end of the programme. And this idea that somebody has been ignored or frozen out is not how I see or how I regard that situation. mark reckless am: I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia.\u00a0I just wonder,\u00a0Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area. kirsty williams am: Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual. kirsty williams am: As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him,\u00a0Owen Evans\u00a0has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you\u2014and I'm absolutely confident\u2014is that we\u00a0have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia\u2014. mark reckless am: I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him\u00a0individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a\u00a0desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers\u00a0being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about?\u00a0Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government to help in this area. kirsty williams am: Firstly, can I say that I have never described the programme as a failure? I would understand, as someone who has put so much personal investment into the brand of schools challenges, that he would not want anybody to characterise that particular approach to school improvement as a failure. And I want to be absolutely clear that I have never described the programme as a failure, and I want to reassure Mr Ainscow of that. As I've said, gosh, my goodness me, if you saw my e-mail inbox and you saw the letters that come in, people are never shy\u00a0in coming forward to give me advice on what I need to do, what I need to do next, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and, you know, our doors are always open to listen to people who have interesting things to say about how we can deliver our educational mission. I'm sure the Minister is aware that Cardiff put extra funds of its own in to continue Schools Challenge Cymru advisers. So, obviously, they appreciated the value of the scheme, but it does query whether it should have gone on longer. kirsty williams am: Julie, I think, to be fair, there are some people who think the scheme was absolutely fantastic. I've had feedback from people who didn't think the scheme was helpful at all\u2014in fact, they felt it was a hindrance. I'm very much of the view that the scheme worked really well for some schools in some areas and had less impact\u00a0in some areas. What's important to me is that we understand what it was that led those schools to make those big changes, how we can\u2014like Mark talked about,\u00a0the expertise\u2014how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply\u00a0the lessons to all schools. john griffiths am: Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. john griffiths am: That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings? kirsty williams am: Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual\u00a0school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region? kirsty williams am: I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there could sometimes be tensions between the two, but in most cases, the relationship was very, very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers. But I'm going to be blunt and honest with people\u2014in some cases, it has been reported to me\u2014it's only anecdotal evidence; I haven't got hard and fast evidence\u2014that there sometimes was a conflict: 'We're a school challenge school so we don't need to participate or listen to any advice that's coming from the regional consortia.' Or, a local education authority said to me, 'We felt that we couldn't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme.' Those were isolated incidents, and, as I said, it's only anecdotal feedback. steve davies: Just very quickly, I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting\u2014[Inaudible.]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them\u2014and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this\u2014it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions\u2014I can't remember which ones\u2014so he's established relationships\u2014[Interruption.] Sorry? kirsty williams am: Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working. kirsty williams am: Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes\u2014for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent\u00a0monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members\u2014you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG\u2014because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record\u2014can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken? kirsty williams am: Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance, absolutely crucial? That's the bedrock. We don't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school. There are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this, but we are absolutely clear, and best practice and evidence shows us, that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial. And, as I said in the beginning, where we weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. Again, one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt, was, again, the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. lynne neagle am: Okay, and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, updating us on the supply teacher issue. Paper to note 3\u2014another letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, providing further information following our meeting on 15 February. And paper to note 6 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales, following up on the dialogue that they've been having about our inquiry. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting"

Do you want user interface: So , you said  are are we starting with the the project manager: Yes . user interface: so will you maybe start with like the  the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th  things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and industrial designer: Okay . project manager: user interface: marketing: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? project manager: industrial designer:  marketing: It's a bit  phallic . project manager: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? industrial designer:  so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . project manager: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that user interface:  yeah . marketing: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? user interface: Yeah , . user interface: yeah , but  one thing we actually kind of  forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , industrial designer: Yeah , user interface: so we said the back side round , yeah . marketing: and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . project manager: user interface: So so  the user interface as as we discussed last time   on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . user interface: So we have that n  channels here starting from   one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . user interface: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . It's it's quite standard  place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . user interface: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . user interface: And and we would also have a l little  thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . user interface: On the side , marketing: Ah , you did get that in then , user interface: this one . user interface: And and and it's it's on the back is  cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . user interface: See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen project manager: Yeah . user interface: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen  the middle button . project manager: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you marketing: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . industrial designer:  on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . user interface: Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? project manager: But if you hold it in , industrial designer:  . marketing: Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? project manager: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? marketing: Okay , cool . user interface: So I think it project manager: And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . user interface: Yeah , I think  we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: project manager:  it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . project manager: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but  we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . marketing: industrial designer: project manager: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country industrial designer: project manager: and cut some of the prices that way . marketing: so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .  you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Is that right ? marketing: Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . marketing: Well , I thought we'd  kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? project manager: Yeah , just prepare one now . What do you all say ? industrial designer: So ? project manager: I reckon it user interface: S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? marketing: Yeah . Okay   what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . project manager:  we can if we industrial designer: I can I can take note   marketing: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . marketing: Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? project manager: Yeah . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? industrial designer:  the the only thing that we were considering was that  this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , project manager: I think it does .  industrial designer: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left  scrolling with your finger . user interface: so y so we we might do we might want to do like a  another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . project manager: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . industrial designer: So bu it's it's not a huge problem , marketing: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . user interface: But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , project manager: Yeah . user interface: so they just marketing: Yeah , but  because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , user interface: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , because  anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , marketing: Yeah . user interface: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's  project manager: marketing: So  that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . marketing: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? project manager:  marketing: What do you what do you all think ? industrial designer:  . user interface: Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , project manager: Yeah , I think I think for  user interface:  . project manager:  most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to  user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , project manager: They industrial designer: so it opens on the side . industrial designer: So you guys can decide wh whether user interface: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . user interface: Yeah well yeah , project manager: The length is gonna be difficu user interface: but it's it's a bit long . marketing: But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? industrial designer:  this this kind of  makes it more project manager:  . marketing: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? industrial designer: No , we have a locator . project manager: No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , user interface:  that you stick on T_V_ . user interface: Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to  to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . If   if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things project manager: Yeah . user interface: and it's I th I think it's project manager: I'd say six , 'cause the  the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . marketing: Yeah , and  d industrial designer: And  even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology project manager: So industrial designer: so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni project manager: Might be industrial designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but  it's a good technology ,  once they get used to it . project manager: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . marketing: So , should we maybe say f a five industrial designer: So l marketing: and say it is intuitive , project manager: Five ? marketing: but it's different , so , do you know ,  it's obvious how to use it , project manager: Yeah . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ?  intuitive but Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . marketing: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? project manager: marketing:  okay , cool , E_ , okay .  I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . user interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , so it's kinda industrial designer: Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . marketing: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , project manager: Well we've banned them from marketing: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , project manager: industrial designer:  yeah . industrial designer: And moreover it it has  L_C_D_ and everything , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just project manager: Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . industrial designer: Anyway it ha yeah , user interface: Technologi well industrial designer: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . Well  we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . marketing: Yeah , but  you don't project manager: All of the components have been used in other things before . marketing: They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . project manager: What do you reckon , five , six ? marketing: Yeah , what do you all think ? user interface: Six . marketing: Six ? user interface:  how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: marketing: Well , that's it ,  user interface: It still has to do what i what it has to do . industrial designer: marketing: Yeah , but  everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? project manager: marketing: So , I don't think many peop project manager: Space remote . user interface: Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? project manager: industrial designer: The carrot banana remote . marketing: So , we give it seven , and we write user interface: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . user interface: What's the assessment ? marketing: So , we need the average here , so we got user interface: The average is about six and something . marketing: So we've got four sevens , user interface: No , wait , a little bit under six . project manager: Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . project manager: Six point point industrial designer: Fifty one divided by user interface: Six point something , yeah . project manager: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . marketing: project manager: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? marketing:  no , that's it , project manager: That's it ? marketing: yeah . marketing: user interface: project manager: Computer no signal ? industrial designer:  I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . project manager: It could be marketing: Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . project manager: it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . user interface: Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , project manager: Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . project manager: We we're definitely going to have to user interface: We have pushbuttons , industrial designer:  . project manager: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've user interface: scro we have scroll wheel as well . project manager: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? industrial designer: No  we we have  yeah . user interface: Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel project manager: But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: We've got more than one pushbutton though , user interface: Okay , let's yeah . project manager: marketing: haven't we ? project manager: I think the pushbutton oh . marketing: 'Cause then you have project manager: I don't know if that's one marketing: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . industrial designer: Huh ? project manager: Push what  industrial designer: Wh wh what is the limit ?  . project manager: whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we user interface: We have to count all of them , or yeah . industrial designer: No it says what what is the kind of interface , marketing: Well it doesn't , but it  project manager: No . industrial designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , project manager: Yeah . marketing: Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . marketing: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? industrial designer:  and the locator also goes away . marketing:  does project manager: What else does it need ? user interface: Well the speaker  the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . project manager: Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . project manager: Yeah , okay , so we industrial designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . marketing: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause project manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . We could do industrial designer: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in  in the L_C_D_ ? user interface: Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . industrial designer: If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . user interface: Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton  we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . industrial designer: it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ project manager: That's with the L_C_ industrial designer: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? marketing: Yeah . marketing: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether project manager: It's nothing n marketing: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . project manager: Yeah , marketing:  the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but project manager: I have industrial designer: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . marketing: Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? industrial designer: project manager: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . project manager: and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , industrial designer: We have , yeah . industrial designer: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . marketing: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , industrial designer:  yeah . marketing: and the scroll wheel is  essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . user interface: But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . industrial designer: project manager: Tha user interface: Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the industrial designer: marketing: Oh the the beeper thing . project manager: 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .  we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,  so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . project manager: Feedback ? Ideas ? user interface: Yeah  , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . industrial designer: I think  n one thing that was lacking  was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . marketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . project manager: But in terms of the process of  going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . marketing: so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , project manager: industrial designer: marketing: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s project manager: Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down industrial designer: Yeah yeah yeah , project manager: and have it printed out when you got back to the office . industrial designer: that's it's it's project manager: They great ? industrial designer: I wonder what one of these costs . project manager: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? marketing: I don't think you should say that was the recording . project manager: But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , marketing: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? industrial designer: Yeah . user interface: Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the marketing: Yeah . marketing: you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . We could make some little user interface: But yeah , but  already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . marketing: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? industrial designer: project manager: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . project manager: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? user interface: To express them   industrial designer:  . user interface: pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and project manager: Yeah . marketing: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . user interface: Yeah , neither neither do I , project manager: user interface: but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . marketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , project manager: Banana remote . Vibrate user interface: marketing: Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . project manager: well within budget , including a little what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? user interface: And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . industrial designer: I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and  yeah . project manager: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . industrial designer: We certainly are , project manager: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . marketing: project manager: It was very productive day and marketing: We could draw animals on the board again . industrial designer: user interface: Oh , you don't like anim marketing: It's just minging . project manager: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . industrial designer: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? project manager: I don't know if it's already sent or not . project manager:  presumably I have to marketing: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? project manager: I don't see why you can't stay here , really "

        "Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Gr\u0175p Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association. If it's okay with you, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. dafydd evans: Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. dafydd evans: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine. nick brazil: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\u00a0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\u00a0meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bac\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\u00a0those professional sectors. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\u00a0initially, but the Welsh bac\u00a0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\u00a0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand\u00a0the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications\u00a0that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries. sian gwenllian am: Kay, is that your experience? kay martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications.\u00a0But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they\u00a0want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. ed evans: Do you mind if I carry on in English\u2014 sian gwenllian am: Fine. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular\u2014the civil engineering sector\u2014and particularly the\u00a0contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to\u2014. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and\u00a0supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would\u00a0be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate. sian gwenllian am: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course? dafydd evans: I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within\u00a0that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications\u00a0board, I think\u00a0the employers\u2014. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the\u00a0vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate\u2014that it was going to improve skills for employment. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in\u00a0my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. They're there to serve a really good purpose, but it's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic, whereas the Welsh bac offers an opportunity\u2014. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more\u00a0structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we\u00a0join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it. kay martin: Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world. So, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college. sian gwenllian am: So, do we get rid of it? lynne neagle am: You don't need to answer that. [Laughter.] sian gwenllian am: if there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it? nick brazil: I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac\u2014I think when we go back a number of years\u2014was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and\u00a0I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that. suzy davies am: Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014. dafydd evans: I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\u00a0C grade in the core subjects. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow\u2014no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. We've given priority to GCSE\u00a0resits\u00a0rather than doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3. nick brazil: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification\u2014it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac\u2014for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well\u2014that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes\u2014and we all get funded on the outcomes\u2014that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh\u2014I thought that's something that we need to think about. kay martin: If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things. Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels, even in a vocational programme, it's too big for them. As you say, they're coming from schools, some of them with very few GCSEs, or they haven't got literacy and numeracy skills, they're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy. So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people\u2014the A-level students for university\u2014but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't. dr rachel bowen: And this, ultimately, has to be about what's in the best interests of learners, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study. dafydd evans: That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way\u2014 kay martin: Great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then\u2014'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges,\u00a0but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented\u2014we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that\u00a0have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac\u2014normally. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals? nick brazil: Yes. nick brazil: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us\u2014certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners\u2014that a number of them have come from school and\u00a0probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do\u2014think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a\u00a0low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels. dr rachel bowen: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college. janet finch-saunders am: Okay.\u00a0A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac? kay martin: Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. I talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well, but it was a very paper-based exercise. But I think it is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here\u2014University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University\u2014value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students go to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners go to USW. It is valued by them and they accept it, but when people go further afield\u2014and we're always trying to push our learners beyond. lynne neagle am: Did you have a supplementary, Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: Yes. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely. nick brazil: Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt\u2014in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities,\u00a0the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject. Because of the nature of our catchment area, there is a greater percentage of our students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac. But, naturally, we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and we're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities. sian gwenllian am: But in terms of Bangor and Glynd\u0175r University, there's no problem there, though. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that. dafydd evans: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes? I'm certainly not sure, and perhaps we need to think: what are we trying to achieve with this qualification? julie morgan am: Right. kay martin: Yes, and earlier, we talked as well about that difference for the A-level students. For the vocational students, some things like the Career Ready programme, which is used in other colleges, and WorldSkills, you know, where all colleges have really been pushing to get more learners into WorldSkills at national and international level. And for some of our learners, particularly if we take our engineering learners, then having somebody who has competed in Europe as a tiler or an electrician would, I think, make an employer think, 'I'd better look at this person', whereas the other one\u00a0has done the Welsh bac\u2014.",
        "\u00a0I think they would look at the WorldSkills person first. So, for some of our learners, we choose that you do WorldSkills, because that is going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time you've put in. So, they put a lot of time\u2014you know, to get somebody into a WorldSkills competition is not just a couple of hours a week, it isn't just the normal curriculum\u2014they have extra time. They are more able and talented vocational learners, and that is more valuable to those learners and I think it's more valid for employers than the Welsh baccalaureate. You know, it is comparable, as long as it's right for that learner's future. But if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the Welsh bac is not accepted, it's not comparable. But, then, if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector, absolutely. julie morgan am: What are the reasons why some colleges do see it as being rigorous and others don't? Why does the view vary? ed evans: Can I give perhaps an employer's perspective on that, which might be completely wrong, but it's been interesting listening to what's been said here? About a year ago, we bought the\u00a0WJEC in to speak to our employers, or a number of them, just to explain to them what the Welsh bac was about\u2014back to listening and about understanding, really, and it just was not there at all. I could see that most of the employers\u00a0there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand\u2014'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there. kay martin: It probably depends on the subjects that\u00a0people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac\u2014even if they're not doing that. dafydd evans: I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac\u00a0in terms of\u2014I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac\u00a0within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about. nick brazil: On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac\u00a0are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is. dr rachel bowen: I think the baccalaureate\u00a0approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. suzy davies am: Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac\u00a0is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac\u00a0anyway. Is that a fair observation? dr rachel bowen: I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac\u00a0under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see. nick brazil: Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term. lynne neagle am: Julie, did you have any more questions? julie morgan am: No, I've finished, thank you. lynne neagle am: We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption. suzy davies am: Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners,\u00a0i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac\u00a0is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have\u00a0a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their Welsh language skills. We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh\u2014. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac\u00a0in many cases. , if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come\u00a0on in and you won't have to do it.' suzy davies am: Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty? dafydd evans: Yes, absolutely. suzy davies am: Oh, yes, for the reasons you've given in the evidence, actually. dafydd evans: Yes, but across the whole of level 3, A-level and vocational, the Welsh bac\u00a0is an integral part of the curriculum, and it isn't an option for the student to opt out. lynne neagle am: Do you let your Seren\u00a0students opt out like they do in Cardiff and the Vale, or do they have to do it as well? dafydd evans: We've forced\u2014. nick brazil: I've got to be honest, at present, with our college, we do not ask. It's an option of one of our choices\u2014we have a large choice\u2014and I think it comes back to that fact that we're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions. I think it's something we all need to consider across the nation, that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future. I will go back to the point I made earlier\u2014everything's comparable as long as it's the right thing for the learner's future, and I genuinely believe, and I'm sure a lot of colleagues believe, that that choice element is important to a learner, okay. If it is the right choice and if the Welsh bac\u00a0is the right choice, that is correct, and we move that along. But you've got to be doing the right things for the learner, and we are certainly not selling it, 'Come\u00a0to us; you don't do the Welsh bac.' It is part of what we offer. It is part of what the college's curriculum offers\u2014there is no doubt about that\u2014and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future. You explained earlier that if people knew what the bac was about in your sector, they'd value it more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular\u2014who are needed in your sector, after all\u2014might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners\u2014presumably you need them all. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. Again, I'll come back to the input of businesses to support that delivery of commercial skills and so on, but I think I probably made that point earlier. There's clearly going to be different individuals who will cope better, and they will be, I guess, maybe guided as well by parents to a certain degree in terms of, 'You do those four and forget about that nonsense there', which is not helpful, but I can understand why that happens. I guess that's what a lot of our employers saw the Welsh bac\u00a0as being able to do. nick brazil: Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification? lynne neagle am: And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools? nick brazil: As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come\u00a0to us for this particular reason.' lynne neagle am: No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'? nick brazil: The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask,\u00a0'Do\u00a0I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask. sian gwenllian am: And is that the parents asking the question or the pupil? nick brazil: It's a combination. But, honest answer, I would say parents, a lot of the time, but the learners usually\u2014as I said\u2014have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away. sian gwenllian am: Can I suggest that maybe, then, the perception that parents have is steering the way rather than the actual benefits for the pupil in your institution? If you're telling them, 'Come\u00a0to us, you don't have to actually do it because we know you don't like it', is that the correct way of approaching education? nick brazil: No. nick brazil: Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes\u2014if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra\u2014Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac\u00a0to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.' sian gwenllian am: But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time\u2014and parents\u2014they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we\u00a0did\u2014. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run. Anybody want to pick that up? dafydd evans: We certainly have experience of that, of young people coming in with quite a negative attitude, originally, to the Welsh bac and taking it on board. But where we are delivering it well, well contextualised, they've really enjoyed the experience, and very much valued the experience. dafydd evans: But don't underestimate the fact that\u00a0if you had a poor experience of the Welsh bac\u00a0at school, that perception is very difficult for us, as institutions, then, to change. dr rachel bowen: It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things. kay martin: Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC\u00a0programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels\u2014. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that? dafydd evans: I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac\u2014. nick brazil: And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac\u00a0are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification. dawn bowden am: And have you got dedicated time? Because one of the things we picked up from schools was that teachers in particular were kind of fitting it in with other lessons, and therefore, it wasn't being, again, given the same perceived level of importance as doing A-levels were. But your lecturers would all have dedicated time to deliver\u2014 kay martin: On their timetables, yes. ed evans: I was just going to add there, really, if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular, if you've got that\u00a0far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this\u2014. Apologies, I'd almost forgotten that we were in the Colegau thing, I was thinking 'schools' actually [Laughter.] But in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way, not an ad-hoc way, which is just a friend turning up to talk about something, a structured way\u2014. We have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum' in the sector that we hope to roll out. Now, if that was rolled out across the board\u2014I'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular, but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled, global areas, because it's not their bag. So, bring in\u00a0some experts, bring in some business, raise the profile, and I think then, possibly, you'll start to get parents thinking, 'Actually, there is something more to this than just the academic bit.' dawn bowden am: Okay. Can I just ask\u2014? You've all got slightly different policies; they don't have to do it in Swansea, in Cardiff and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-levels. Do you think that's a satisfactory situation, and are you satisfied with the communication and the guidance and the steer that everyone's getting from Welsh Government on this? Because we're meant to have a policy of universal adoption, but that doesn't really seem to be happening on the ground. kay martin: And I think, if you'd asked us a few years ago, we were all heading for universal adoption, but because the Welsh bac\u00a0has changed into something that isn't 100 per cent what we think it should be, then we've stopped the universal adoption, if you like. So, we are trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but I think, as you said, we've mentioned some other programmes, and if we could look at\u2014. We've got industry experts that are brought into colleges as well, some more than others, to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better. We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning. nick brazil: I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac\u00a0is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, paper to note 2 is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales on home education, and paper to note 3 is the letter that the Cabinet Secretary for Education has sent to us in reply to our letter about free school meals. Item 4, then: can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Yes."

        " and I  like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . project manager: this is the the plan for today's meeting is  firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,  although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . project manager:  then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,  specifically the whiteboard over there .  then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan  and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .  we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .  similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . industrial designer: I'm a bit confused about  what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?  i is it just  more detail ,  as I understand it ? project manager: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your  area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control industrial designer: Right . project manager: and what what specific things it it has to do industrial designer: project manager: but the conceptual design is  perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . So whe where do we identify the components of our  product ?  I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? project manager:  I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then industrial designer: Okay .  what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . project manager: So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . industrial designer: marketing: Why are you looking at me ? user interface: marketing: project manager: Would you like to go first ? marketing: Do I have a choice ? industrial designer: marketing: Okay . marketing: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey industrial designer: project manager: marketing: so  user interface: marketing: Okay . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . industrial designer: marketing:  okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . industrial designer: user interface: marketing: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . project manager: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? marketing: I am the  I need my notebook ,  ooh industrial designer: marketing: top banana . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert  so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design ,  trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager: industrial designer: project manager: And more about yourself , you're from ? marketing:  I'm from Leicester , project manager:  what else do you want to know ? industrial designer: marketing: I like sports  yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning project manager: marketing:  and  project manager: But not with rabbits . project manager: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .  so   I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m  I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very  familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . project manager: user interface: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but industrial designer:  . project manager: industrial designer: marketing: user interface:  well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay  . user interface:  yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . project manager: user interface:  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . project manager: user interface:  I hope to be loyal to the project industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and not to n not to  let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . industrial designer: project manager: And where where are you from ? user interface: I'm from Estonia project manager: Estonia .  so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , industrial designer: . user interface:  so  in the different  stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for  for yeah , designing the technical functions of the   of the remote control  then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to  come up with  interface concept and then in the last  stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Okay  I'll do some I'll rub the features project manager: industrial designer: and let the drawing stay . user interface: industrial designer:  this is going to be marketing: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs industrial designer: Yeah , that'll do . industrial designer: Big , round body , really skinny legs marketing: project manager: industrial designer: and they've got a long tail marketing: industrial designer: and a long face . industrial designer: So this is what I like about cows marketing: Horns , project manager: user interface: industrial designer: that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , marketing: draw some horns . industrial designer: they do not disturb anybody  marketing: project manager: industrial designer: they're kind of Buddhist in a way .  my my role in the project is   the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product  ho how it works and whatever it'll  take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it  during the  conceptual design , what are the various components of it and  finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .  the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .  I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . industrial designer: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? project manager: Okay , here's a space . project manager:  I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . marketing: Is there a difference ? user interface: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they project manager: They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . user interface: yeah , they are project manager: And I I like geckos user interface: project manager: and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house user interface: Ah . marketing: project manager: and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . industrial designer: user interface: I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? project manager: I don't like snakes . project manager: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today industrial designer:  . project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . So , I've just thought marketing: If you right click on it you can project manager: yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as marketing: industrial designer: We've got  we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .  so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about  what we're thinking of this remote control ? user interface: Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , industrial designer: project manager: but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be  included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . industrial designer: I think  i in the beginning  one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be  trendy , user friendly and original so  I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . marketing: and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . marketing: and  so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? project manager: marketing: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . marketing: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly  I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? project manager: project manager: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or industrial designer: marketing: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like  you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? project manager: marketing: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . industrial designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , marketing: Sometimes they play a movie . marketing: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , project manager: So , no . project manager: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . marketing: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine project manager: industrial designer:  . marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . marketing: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing project manager: Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . marketing:  but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .  we can aim for  we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that  it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , project manager: user interface: Yeah but   e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't  go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems industrial designer: Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a project manager: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access industrial designer: yeah . project manager: because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .  we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , industrial designer: Alright . project manager: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , marketing: - "

        "industrial designer: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? user interface: We have a slight problem . project manager: Sorry ? industrial designer: Can I get a cup of coffee ? project manager:  no . project manager:  then  the three of you  prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? industrial designer: I think so too . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: Then we'll do your one   as la  the last .  the top goal of this m user interface: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . project manager:  the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group  and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .  the new project requirements , first of all ,  we didn't speak about it , but we should not  support teletext in the remote ,  because our b  board  feels that  teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .  the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not  f  feasible , it's not  w user interface: Yeah . project manager:   we we cannot make it because of the time to market  that we have to deal with . project manager:  the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than  forty , which is important for you ,  Ruud , and as well for  Roo .  then for Roo , as well  important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .  the individual presentations , I th  Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? user interface: Yeah , I'll start .  the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . user interface: Then I found  two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function  remote control with many possibilities , but  the lack of the feeling I already mentioned  in the previous  discussion . user interface: And the ease-of-use remote control with  the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . My personal preferences were ease of  the easy to use remote control , because  the user-friendliness and  it can be more trendy in in user design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not  in our design . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is  the best  possi possibility for us . project manager: Okay , so marketing: project manager: the important thing here is user interface: And it's also i indeed   Ruud's  insight in the in the topic . project manager: Yeah , okay , w we will s we all  user interface: Just for  for user desi  user  friendliness I  should choose for the the ease of use remote control .  well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . user interface: industrial designer:  basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by  sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to  implement a picture here , user interface: Energies and  industrial designer: but it's hardly readable . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using  infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . It's almost every piece of equipment  every piece of  every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . And I think that's what we w user interface: The glow in the dark  concept  we discussed . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . industrial designer: and I think we should  we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . industrial designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared , because  otherwise our device cannot  communicate with  almost every T_V_ set . And  if we want to use  a rechargeable design or  a energy-save design , we should really implement them .  for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost  circuit board ,  because most of the production cost are are in this  part of the equipment . industrial designer: And  the money we save on using this we can use  for elaborate fancy lighting  techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . user interface: And what's the  industrial designer: I think our  users will really  will really like that . user interface: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or industrial designer: No , they're p f  power friendly LEDs also . user interface: For the same costs , it's can be  in our industrial designer:  no , they're  they're a little bit more expensive , but by    making user interface: Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's  industrial designer: We can we can make its I think . project manager: Yeah , but but the question is whether  two or four buttons makes  m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to  include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . user interface: Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , marketing: true . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . project manager: Okay well , industrial designer: project manager: we ar we are very curio curious to what the market  will feel about such a product . marketing: But  since  the other part is  forty percent of the market , I  thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . The buttons to zap are used the about  fifteen hundred times , when  the power button is only used one time . So user interface: Yeah , well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? industrial designer: Well marketing: Yeah , that's  a problem . project manager: Well industrial designer: Usually project manager: maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , user interface: It should be   project manager: like  turning on and off the the the lights . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a  kind of weird sound , and your  remote controls then start to beep . project manager: But  th user interface: But but T_V_s don't have all   buttons . marketing: And you project manager: Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home  user interface: But I believe you will have an marketing: Yeah , and usually industrial designer: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . marketing: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button ,  you would have to walk to your T_V_ , industrial designer: Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , marketing: and it's project manager: Okay . industrial designer: so we should think about project manager: So what about the clapping technique ?  because you se user interface: I'm convinced  Sebastian will  find  one solution for us . marketing: And b project manager: Well , you see it a lot in in light  lightning   industrial designer: Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics  the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , project manager: Yeah , a peak . industrial designer: But there are many other sounds  which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . industrial designer: Yes , user interface: But we can have just   a home stat  f a base station next to the T_V_ . user interface: Well if you lost th industrial designer: Well , project manager: Well  industrial designer: is there not something f something more easily user interface: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . user interface:  that's just  industrial designer: No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and  b  perform a a some kind of  . You do not want another device , which can be  everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . project manager: Yeah , m maybe  w we  we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . project manager:  maybe Sebastian should have  a detailed look later on and  come up with a solution , industrial designer: But  before I do that I w I want to warn you that  by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated project manager: And there are some implepe imp user interface: And do we even  prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning  function ? industrial designer: Well , I I think so , because  when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . user interface: It's a unique item  project manager: Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . project manager: and  I think  it's worth   looking and and probably more i interesting than  than the lights . user interface: And just about  the user interface , I came up with  an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . marketing: Well , t  we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager: Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players  and all kind of stuff . user interface: So industrial designer: we should save costs  by not implementing a lot of functions and  the money that we can save from that we should use for  having a nice design and  thinking about the user interface project manager: Yeah . Okay , industrial designer: and project manager: Ruud , how do you feel about that ?  do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to  a simple marketing:  well if we  include other  innovative functions  then they  might , project manager: user interface:  just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated ,  because it has many functions . industrial designer: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very  friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but  nevertheless project manager: But but are we not in in the in the manual   if you have few buttons , no display ,    I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and  one button can  industrial designer: Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . project manager: But but how does how does the remote  report  r  give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface: Yeah , I don't know yet . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . project manager: I know , but but if we use  like a stick , for example ,  industrial designer: W When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe  a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just  pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t  turned up the volume . marketing: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel  selection , you have the m two most important functions in one  button . user interface: But does it  I then should n just use  i instead of the stick ,  like many cell phones , just a round m well , project manager: Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Oh user interface: It's just an easy  way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . user interface: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down project manager: Yeah , it can break down . marketing: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it  attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . project manager: Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of    putting in advanced options .  we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . user interface: Yes ? project manager: We need to  have the  the user function  the functions decided and   our target audience . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ?  which  incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager:  well , I do not want a full  it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want  the kind of functions , for example  th the most important are volume and  programme selecting . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but user interface: Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to  two channels , when you have  something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can  change industrial designer: project manager: Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last  Mielsen . industrial designer: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . project manager: And and do we want  the ten digits ? user interface: The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . industrial designer: Well , are are you sure ? marketing: Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer: but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should  shou you should know that . industrial designer: Okay , user interface:  and I think the most industrial designer: I can imagine when project manager: I agree actually . user interface: Just elder elder people would would buy it , industrial designer: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . marketing: Well user interface: but industrial designer: But if you're  a regular T_V_ user , and you just want  to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can  you can use  about ten buttons . industrial designer: Well , marketing: Yeah , industrial designer: but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing: and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Don't you think ? project manager: Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer: The design . marketing: Well project manager: You c you can d make them very fancy marketing: And project manager: by   Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . industrial designer: Okay , so you can experiment by  with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .  it might be expensive and  hard to implement , but it would be a solution  for project manager: Okay , speech . industrial designer: So  when you add  speech recognition to your remote control ,  it's very easy to change  the channel . industrial designer: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . project manager:  If if we would  drop the ten digits industrial designer: But maybe when we  project manager: but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find  find the remote control button  remote control function . industrial designer: There are some  hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . industrial designer: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . project manager: But But but can we manage it bu  for the costs ? industrial designer: You have to do nothing for it . marketing: And  if we if we could inc  include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be  a big problem . marketing: 'Cause when project manager: Is a cradle very cheap ? industrial designer: It's Oh , it's very cheap .  I would like to hear  maybe maybe you all have th  things not  spoken about , yeah , but that are important .  are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing:  I think we dealt with the most important information . project manager: Sebastian ? industrial designer:  I just want to make a summary of all all things  spoken and  the different possibilities . So on the outside it looks easy , but  we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by  implementing  speech techniques ,  voice recognition , that these kinds of things .  there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement  fancy techniques , which  I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about  the the costs and  the things like  battery lifetime , energy saving . industrial designer:  another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . If we just add   a chip which does the voice recognition ,  our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another project manager: Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board industrial designer: well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface: But the cheaper the ch  the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer: project manager: No , it's th industrial designer: The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . user interface: Well it then we should just  take a look at the costs and  especially for the voice recognition . project manager: I'm not sure how how we'll f  determine the costs , I will have a look at it . project manager:  I'm not sure how how that industrial designer: Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will  have a lo  look at it . project manager:  I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . project manager:  then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work ,  and I'm sure your personal coaches will  assist you with it . project manager: User Interface Designer ,  Roo , I would like to see the user interface c  concept . project manager: And  user interface:  the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis  decisions Sebastian makes . industrial designer: Well project manager: Well , i it should be easy , user interface: Well project manager: that's w w what we concluded . industrial designer: So we drop the voice recognition ? project manager: No no no , we didn't industrial designer: Or project manager: but it shouldn't be integrated industrial designer: Oh . project manager: yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but  i I was talking about really the design of the industrial designer: Okay "

        "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . industrial designer: project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and  user interface:  . B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "

        "I just thought marketing: What was it , problem ? user interface: it didn't work anymore . industrial designer: user interface: project manager: Welcome to the conceptual design meeting industrial designer: marketing: project manager: for Real Reaction .   , and at the end ,  I  , when I finish it off I have some  input from  a master class I  visited . project manager: industrial designer: project manager: The the the the the concepts on  we  where we  must reach a decision on .  , the first one is  really about the the the the the total package  with  Well , we have decided to do a do the  with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so  it won't be   as breakable .  how how about the energy ? Can you  can you reload it or  just have batteries which you must exchange ?  , the user interface concept . marketing: project manager: At the end ,  I will take notes  and at the end of the minutes  will  be at the shared folder . marketing: industrial designer: what I did was I reviewed previously used items  by  two two  different  age groups . And  I just  watch what the differences are and I checked  , well , what what d do we want , and how can we  d aim a at  the target group . Well  what I found was that a senior  project manager: industrial designer: senior citizens  marketing: I'm sorry . industrial designer:  They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more .  ,  they they they they like luxurious  styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more  soft materials . project manager: industrial designer: soft and fluffy and colourful and marketing: industrial designer: Well  , shapes are curved and round . project manager:  a soft material for a remote control ? industrial designer: No , I'll I'll get to that . industrial designer: But  the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery  versus kinetic . I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . industrial designer: Well , we could also use a battery , that's a bit marketing: Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? project manager: user interface: industrial designer: Yeah . Or you can go for both ? user interface: Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? industrial designer: Yeah , I actually did . industrial designer: and you you could you could use normal light , but  you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . industrial designer:  for  ultimate b  n  use of  solar panels , you could actually use  you could use  solar panels , but  you ha you'd have to implement them into  the remote control , leaving you  a bit less space for the interface . industrial designer: So  so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f I've figured it out that well ,  seeing that you'll always be  within the l  distance of T_V_ , and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light . industrial designer: But , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't  have the full amount of power actually used . project manager: But you prefer kinetic ? industrial designer: So I I prefer kinetic because it's  well , the costs aren't that much higher , and  , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . industrial designer: if No , but  d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you project manager: And that's enough to to keep the energy level  industrial designer: Yeah , well  actually it is . industrial designer: And it it if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . industrial designer: But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . industrial designer: And so that   well , user interface: industrial designer: f furthermore , you you we  checked  the cases . You ha I you sim  you simply add a basic  standard  model  it was kind of square and  I figured that's a bit boring .  , single curve , it's just a well , you know , it's just  a nice curve . industrial designer: That gives you an whole new  effec project manager: Dynamic dynamic look ? marketing:  . industrial designer: Yeah , that gives you a younger and  more high-tech look , I f I figured . marketing: But , are you going to draw it ? industrial designer: What ? user interface: Th th yeah . industrial designer: And then  in three-D_ effect you could go user interface:  marketing:  project manager: industrial designer: So y you you just Yeah , this is a this bit  difficulty in marketing: user interface: industrial designer: I didn't take a major in art . So But but you could have   a whole new  the back back the the the depth , you could you could  just play around a bit with . industrial designer: but just a Well , furthermore ,  well ,  plastic versus rubber ? You We could choose  what  what's better , plastic  or rubber . project manager: That's the material the younger people want  , ain't it ? user interface: industrial designer: Yeah , yeah   plastic  is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic  Your your I usually associate plastic with  something that's cheap . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . And  chip set , well  if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go  with a simple chip set . But  if we decide to go on a n   L_C_D_ screen , we would use an  we have to use an a advanced chip set . If it isn't  manageable  budget-wise , we'd have to go over to  to sim to simple buttons . So  I bet a big company in  Korea or Taiwan , like  Samsung , can give us  a big discount on the chips , so industrial designer: user interface: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , probably , but But  yeah , that's that's marketing: So That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think . I'll I'll I'll just add ,   I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit .  what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? marketing: user interface: I think you should use kinetic as a back-up . project manager: industrial designer: Yeah , well Fifty cent  user interface: industrial designer: why doesn't And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . industrial designer: rubber ? user interface: isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . industrial designer: You user interface: Or do you think it industrial designer: I figured it will be m rather than hard user interface: Rubber casing , yeah . industrial designer: because well if you use an  d a touch-screen ,  it's just a casing  around it . user interface: is it possible  of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? It isn't , I think , yeah ? industrial designer: Well , m I don't know . user interface: We're We put fashion in electronics , industrial designer: That isn't user interface: so maybe we can  marketing:  ? Yeah okay , but if you have a square  L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has  like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . industrial designer: So    so  so what are the opinions ?  rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber . project manager: Yeah ? industrial designer: Yeah , you too ? user interface: That's good . user interface: Well , as long a as long as it's it's  it's firm , and you don't  it's not bendable or something , project manager: marketing:  yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand  project manager: Okay . industrial designer: No , that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place , marketing: user interface: Okay . industrial designer: and  and and  and a L_C_D_ screen also user interface: It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . marketing: industrial designer: tra  traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that . Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . user interface: industrial designer: marketing: Okay  Last week project manager: marketing: I went to  Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . In Paris and Milan , we  asked different people ,  differing in age and in income ,  the amount of money to spend ,  what they like in design  and material nowadays . industrial designer: Well , the Teletubbies sh project manager: marketing: You wer you weren't in Paris ? Okay . Okay , our secondary audience ,  people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .  Yeah ,  materials like wood that project manager: Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of . industrial designer: marketing: The that isn't wood anyway , but Okay ? But , that's our secondary audience . project manager: Would you prefer   that you can choose the colour of your  remote control or marketing: I'll I'll come to that in a second point . industrial designer: project manager: marketing: Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . industrial designer: marketing: Like the Nokia  the removable covers ,  just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . So  to come back to your question , I think  and the people in Milan and Paris also think that  the rubber should be pretty hard . The phones and the project manager: industrial designer: Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so Yeah . project manager: marketing: in my second sheet of personal preferences ,  we have to reconsider the speech function  recognition . project manager: So that you say  S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to  marketing: Yeah , like something . marketing: You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak  speech recognition and stuff . But , we have to keep the cost in  in mind , but it user interface: Twelve fifty  marketing: Yeah , it it can be  very expensive .  project manager: Yeah , but you don't use that th games when you watching television , I think . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . user interface: When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . Well , I do that , but Okay , and  project manager: industrial designer: marketing: And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality  with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . So if you press  system , that's marketing: user interface: Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . Or maybe even a step further when you want to  t  have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . And  well , how do  do we want to look at   f  Yeah Does a remote look Well , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . So  the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands .  One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . project manager: user interface: know that if you are changing the menu structure here ,  And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and  push plus twenty times . And when you get to n to  to ten , ye and want to go back ,  well you have a problem . Just m most most modern T_V_s , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten .  , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up  button ? project manager: user interface: Yeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to  tell it . marketing: But if you go from two to eight , and you want user interface: Or if you're watching Studio Sports on  on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two marketing: Yeah , and on two . user interface: And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time  to d use the other options . project manager:  I think we can discuss a little about the the three  kind of revolutionary things  Tim  came with . marketing: industrial designer: project manager:  industrial designer: project manager: There's n not  too much decision on  that one so  I think that parental control is a good function to  to put in the remote . marketing: Yeah but What I see  How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . marketing: And w when you want to use the parents  option , you have to user interface: It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for  the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . marketing: Yeah , ok project manager: No but I think most people  find it  much more important that their children don't watch  sex or violence  on the television , and  wait  ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can  finally watch it  because of that . You c may use like when there's  X_P_ ,  a simple log-on , d you just push  one or two or three . user interface: And if you push parents , then marketing: That then then then you have to  go to three-digit  log-in . user interface: And if you w you push p children ,  you don't have to  log in , but you can only watch  children's channels or  marketing: It automatically goes Yeah . Well industrial designer: I don't know if it's worth  the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time  to programming it . And I'm not sure if it's actually worth  investing that much time and effort into it . project manager: Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , industrial designer: I don't know what project manager: because  you Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that  that he Yeah , they believe that children  are influenced by the television , industrial designer: marketing:  yeah . But there are a lot of  people will below forty who have  children in young age  who who want  to  not watch  violent or  user interface: Yeah . user interface: Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , project manager: Yeah . user interface: 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the  things to do . project manager: That's a that's a better idea ? marketing: Yeah , w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . marketing: But if you want to install it personally  If I got kids , and I could choose between  two remote controls . user interface: You're thinking about some channels they  cannot see , but well , I I when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock  in the evening violent films and movies  will come industrial designer: marketing: user interface: and  maybe maybe some some timing  will be  needed instead of  of channels , marketing: Yeah . user interface: because if you're watching  , I don't know , you're in the at day  , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . But maybe there's some option that  that t  the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . user interface: Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , project manager: Yeah . industrial designer: But , well , if you want to I i i if we in incorporate  the parental control ,  let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho  child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . user interface: Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but industrial designer: But that Well , I'm not sure because  for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the  remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant  constant signalling . industrial designer: What m what may be better is to incorporate an  a separate device that  that you can program with the remote control . So there's n that's there's  besides  the remote control , you'll have a separate  project manager: I wouldn't put it in an optional device . industrial designer: Yeah ? project manager: If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . marketing: And and you know w  when you install another device ,  children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open  the thing and and and g project manager: Yeah . But industrial designer: But , only difference is  the  the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , project manager: industrial designer: and those people wouldn't  necessary want it . And what do you  guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much . user interface: Yeah , well yeah , I project manager: It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but user interface: A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . user interface: But I don't think when you're watching T_V_  , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches ,  Yeah . project manager: That would user interface: As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote , marketing: That that doesn't c that doesn't co user interface: but  marketing: Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think . So that will  that that that must be in it , you think ? industrial designer: Yeah , that will be nice . And the parental control are user interface: Optional in project manager: optional ? marketing: Yeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but user interface: But how we do it ? project manager: Yeah . user interface: Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . user interface: Is t some menu  function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on .  , but  will there   Like the first idea  from  You can buy it without and  with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and  just  user interface: marketing: To put user interface: You can put on marketing: Yeah , to put it in always . And you can just  s when you buy it , you can select  personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with  well   a receiver in it . marketing: Yeah ? I thought they were just project manager: Yeah , you yo industrial designer: Yeah , you you have some T_V_s any marketing: a able to receive . user interface: Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . industrial designer: Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . But , on the T_V_ user interface: Yeah ? marketing: at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . marketing: And there are buttons  behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a industrial designer: Yeah . industrial designer: Yeah , you could you could you could go like user interface: or make it ourselves very diffic industrial designer:  that that would actually make  things a lot more easy . industrial designer: I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but marketing: Or j Yeah . user interface: marketing: Ah project manager: marketing: I have to  consult my legal advisor about it . So  I think we have decided on the things that  from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . user interface: industrial designer: project manager: The case will be double-curved and  rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour  that with cover is removable . project manager: Yeah , but you have that in the user interface: What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . You use the user interface: And when you push  system properties ,  entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . industrial designer: Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and  some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . project manager: We take it to the other meeting , okay ? I have a little w  little chat to do marketing: Okay . project manager: I went to  a master class and   two things  are  are  can come in handy  for us . Knowledge engineering and   the fact that  that  that the idea of knowledge ,  sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is  like that . marketing: project manager: It's it's  very hot at the moment , marketing: project manager: so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other  marketing: Marketing . marketing: Yeah , that's my function , to industrial designer: project manager:  W user interface: marketing: Okay . project manager: What other companies  had to  also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some  Yeah . project manager: they're a ha they're at Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw . marketing: project manager: I  couldn't  Okay ,  another  thing is  there were there there was a survey , and   it came out that  people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who  are partnering  with us . So , we must  we must bring it as if  Real Reaction is  is big company ,  a trustful company , and  it has m marketing: How I know a marketing name for our product . project manager: I had a I had another idea to put   the whole the whole idea of  Real Reaction and    a single brand and   that kind of thing . marketing: - ? project manager: When you  put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little  animation . user interface: marketing: Yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and project manager: The user interface: Yeah . But w th the idea from this  thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own . industrial designer: Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can you can  have a small logo i  at the bottom . user interface: Yeah , I It's ok For f project manager: That's what they said in the master class . user interface: Oh , for the next meeting , right ? industrial designer: marketing: project manager: N  , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . marketing: Who who gave you the master class ? project manager: The master class ? marketing: Ronald Betenberg ? project manager: Franz Mehler's . industrial designer: project manager:  idea that you  the the industrial  development  centre and  user interface  will work together on a prototype . user interface:  industrial designer: So we're going to work together right now ? user interface: Stay here and project manager: Yeah , the well ,  dids this what I  what I heard . project manager: But keep an eye on your  laptops for a real  industrial designer: Yeah ,  I'm not sure if we  we Because I saw something about individual actions . project manager: Yeah , but th there's there's still the my  instructions that you will work together "

        "We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and Jack Sargeant and I'm very pleased to welcome Jayne Bryant back, who is substituting for Jack today. Item 2, then, this morning, is our sixth scrutiny session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome our witnesses this morning: Sally Jenkins, who is chair of All Wales Heads of Children\u2019s Services and is here representing the Association of Directors of Social Services; Alastair Birch, who is senior system leader for equalities and safeguarding at Pembrokeshire County Council, who is here representing the Association of Directors of Education Wales; and Councillor Huw David, who is the Welsh Local Government Association spokesperson for health and social care and leader of Bridgend County Borough Council. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so, if you're happy, we'll go straight into questions and I'll start just by asking about your general support for the Bill, which is outlined in the evidence. Can you just explain why you think the current law is ineffective or unclear? alastair birch: Bore da\u2014bore da, bawb. The statement, really, from ADEW is that the rights of the child should be educated and achieved, really, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The current legislation has been criticised, obviously, by the UN concerning the defence of reasonable punishment still being within our current legislation. So, we will always\u2014ADEW will always\u2014advocate that the rights of the child be upheld, so that is really the fundamental aspect in terms of the statement from ADEW, and the position of ADEW is that the rights of the child are fundamental in this process. I know that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 made sure that article 3 and article 4, article 12 and article 37 were a focus in terms of making sure that the best interests of the child were put first, that children expressing their views and opinions was a priority. And we know, for safeguarding purposes, that the express opinions of the child and the voice of the child are a fundamental aspect of any safe environment, whether it be a school or college. So, that is\u2014the position is really following that legal position under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure. Nothing to add at this stage, no? sally jenkins: I'll just add, on behalf of ADSS and on behalf of children's services and social services more widely, for us, this is not a change in our position, this is not new; this is a position that we, on behalf of the leaders of social services across Wales, have taken over many years, going back 20, 25 years. I think what we would say is that we really welcome this Bill and we welcome the proposed change for the clarity it would bring\u2014the clarity that it would bring for children, for parents and for professionals. I think what we would recognise is that this is a very little-used piece of legislation, so it's rare, it's not as if this is something that is going to cast great change across the scene for children and families in Wales, but what it will do is represent a change in the reality of how we care and nurture our children. I would echo absolutely what Alastair has said in terms of the rights of the child, but equally, in terms of all of our policies in Wales in terms of promoting well-being for children, this has to be key. So, for us, this is about a natural progression of change in how we care for our children in Wales. For children's services at the very sharp end of this world, for us, it brings a true clarity. This continues with an ambiguity in how we treat our children and how we care for our children, and the shift for us brings that very much needed clarity. The committee has already heard different views about whether there's clear evidence that physical punishment is harmful to children. What evidence does the work of social services provide about whether physical punishment is actually harmful? sally jenkins: Obviously, what you'll all be aware of is that, as part of the consultation for this Bill, the Public Policy Institute did a further piece of research to look at the impact of physical punishment on children. A number of things that we know\u2014we know from across the world that the evidence is that introducing legislation or changing legislation in this way improves children's positions within their families. What we know is that children themselves, as Alastair has already referred to, really find physical punishment demeaning and harmful, and for children it is an emotionally damaging experience. Now, there may be disagreement about that, there will be different views on that, but that's the voice of the child in this debate. I think what we would also say is that, in the world that we work in, it's part of a continuum, and, whilst this is an element of how children are cared for, what we see is a continuum where an acceptance of how we treat children in a particular way perpetuates throughout our work. By changing this, it helps that shift to that absolute recognition that our children must be cared for in a way that is physically safe in all dimensions for them. We've had evidence from the equal protection network that the reasonable punishment defence undermines child protection and fails to protect children because it permits an arbitrary level of violence, which invades children's physical integrity, making it a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse, and you did refer to that just now. It is about how we see our smallest and most vulnerable people, and if it is acceptable it opens the door to those other, more extreme versions of violence, which then complicates the issue for us. This is about clarity, and, whilst there is an argument that this is a small episode for a child, it's not a small episode for a child, it is a major episode for a child, and I think absolutely, as you said, the potential for it then to lead on, and over gradation and time to increase the risk for children, is clearly there. The final question from me: your written evidence emphasises the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, but that contrasts with what we've been told by the children's commissioner and the equal protection network, who've emphasised the importance of simplicity in the Bill. How do you respond to that view, and is what you're calling for essential to be on the face of the Bill? sally jenkins: It's not essential for it to be on the face of the Bill. Absolutely agree in terms of simplicity\u2014I think that is really important\u2014and I've already mentioned clarity. We know that the legislation in different countries has done that, and there are ways that you can do it, but what we would welcome is an opportunity during the implementation phase for discussion. huw david: And, as a principle, obviously we would welcome full involvement, and we know there's the commitment from Welsh Government to full involvement in the implementation, because, as with every piece of legislation, implementation is the most important part, and we would want to ensure there is that commitment to a major awareness-raising campaign, and there is that from Welsh Government, because we need to take families, carers and parents with us on this. Also we need to ensure that there is that support available to parents and carers that do sometimes struggle with parenting, and that needs to be a universal offer across Wales. If we're to progress with this, that has to be an option that is offered to every parent in Wales. sally jenkins: Local authorities have already been very heavily involved in terms of looking at this Bill and exploring what the issues are and the discussions and looking at what the implications from a local authority perspective will be, as Huw describes, both in terms of the awareness raising, early support and intervention and prevention services for families against the backdrop of the current issues that we have in local government, but also awareness raising\u2014because absolutely it is key that families come with us on this journey. [Laughter.] dawn bowden am: You've already said, obviously, that you're looking towards working with Welsh Government in terms of its implementation. What's been your role so far in terms of the implementation of the Bill\u2014local authorities generally, now? Have you had a role? Has Welsh Government been involving you in discussions around the introduction of the Bill so far? huw david: Yes. So, obviously we were consulted\u2014a key consultee\u2014but also our officials have worked very closely with Welsh Government officials to make sure this is implemented successfully, if it is progressed. sally jenkins: Our involvement with this, from a social services perspective, goes back over two years, directly in working towards this point, never mind the history in terms of work towards this area. But, very directly in relation to this Bill, we were first involved at least two years ago, to recollect, and that was in a series of workshops with other agencies, for example Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru and the police, and looking in real depth at what the implications would be for us as agencies to look at what the likely trajectory would be in terms of our pathways for referral into our services and what that might mean for us. And then particularly, for example, with CAFCASS Cymru in relation to private law, what the fallout might be, and then what, if anything\u2014and that's the discussion that we need to have\u2014that could mean for children's services in particular, given the pressures that we're already under. So, we've been in constant, I suppose, involvement in terms of the Bill already, as part of the consultation, in terms of the focus groups and in terms of direct work with Welsh Government officials to take this forward. You touched there on the pressures that you're already under, which we fully appreciate, but you also mentioned in answers to Lynne Neagle earlier on that you welcomed the Bill in terms of its clarity. So, are you confident that the Bill can be implemented without any major impact on your capacity to deal with it? sally jenkins: We've done\u2014. A number of local authorities\u2014my own included, Newport City Council, has done some work to look at what the likely impact would be and then actually to look at what some of that costing would need to be. I think what we've done is we've looked internationally at what the impact has been elsewhere when similar legislation has been introduced to try and gauge, but that's difficult to do in terms of comparable nations and size and also different systems. And obviously our approach in terms of children and pedagogy is very different from some of the nations that have already done this. I wouldn't like to say one way or the other, because I think, in terms of that culture shift, it could be a double impact on us in terms of increased referrals because of increased awareness, but it could also be, I suppose, as Huw alludes to, that, if we're looking at ensuring greater awareness of preventative services and support services for parents, actually people coming to the fore and asking us for those services as well. So, at this stage, I think what we would want to say is that we continue to be fully involved in the implementation phase, to look at what the cost implications for that could be, and not just for the local authorities but also the police, CAFCASS Cymru, for third sector organisations involved in preventative services. I don't think any of that should undermine the position in terms of children and their rights within our society. So, a difficult answer, in the sense that\u2014 dawn bowden am: No, I understand. What you're saying is that this is a piece of legislation that, in your view, is a good piece of legislation. It's setting out to, hopefully, achieve what the purpose of it is and you will deliver what you need to. Can I ask you whether, then, you've also given thought to the impact on\u2014we've talked about social services, but the impact on other services, like housing, education and so on? You're obviously coming at it from slightly different angles in other sections. alastair birch: We are part of the universal service for children, and we very much work in co-operation with the WLGA and our social care colleagues, and we've been part of that consultation. And, in terms of the Bill, there needs to be the clarity\u2014ambiguity would be bad\u2014in terms of making sure that safeguarding leads within all schools have the right training and support. So, really, that's the key element there, and then obviously the preventative services for the parents that schools can signpost, and sometimes possibly even host, in terms of being community schools. I have colleagues who have worked in that area for many years and see the benefits in how those positive parenting approaches make a difference to families. dawn bowden am: So, from your point of view, it's awareness raising, is it? alastair birch: It's awareness raising; it's making sure that professionals are fully briefed on necessary changes, that there's very little ambiguity, that we are aware that\u2014. That'll still be part of the all-Wales child protection procedures.\u00a0That won't change, and that duty is always going to be there for all our professionals. But that awareness raising and training will be the key, and then, obviously, working in co-operation with our colleagues. Have you been given an indication of how long you've got between Royal Assent and implementation, and whether you've thought through any of the key milestones that need to be implemented? sally jenkins: There's a group proposed that would be a strategic leadership group in the steering group that we're part of, which is now laying out what would happen after Royal Assent if that is given. My final question, Chair, is about some of the responses we've had to this committee that say that the state should not get involved in family life\u2014I'm sure you've heard those views\u2014unless it's in the most serious circumstances. To what extent do you think that this Bill undermines the existing local authority responsibilities, or don't you? huw david: The state's paramount role is to protect children from harm. And there is obviously a view\u2014it's a view that is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\u2014that physical punishment, physical harm to a child is harm to a child, and we should be preventing that and act to prevent that. That would be the position of the Welsh Local Government Association, and we also respect the mandate that Members of the National Assembly for Wales have too. And we believe that children can be raised by parents without recourse to physical punishment, effectively, and we'd support parents in that. We do not believe that in the 50 nations across the world where such legislation exists that the state is interfering in family life unnecessarily. We believe this action reflects a cultural change, a sea change that's taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years, where the vast majority of parents now say that they do not use it themselves, they do not support it, and we believe this is actually a reflection of what has happened in Welsh society. We support Assembly Members in the view that the natural progression of that is that children's rights are protected across Wales. dawn bowden am: So, I've got largely positive feedback from you in terms of the Bill and its intentions, and so on. Do you foresee any unintended consequences for this Bill? huw david: If we implement it carefully, if we implement it with the right resources, then I hope not. But as with every piece of legislation, it is about the implementation, it is about the cultural change as well, and that's why I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that resources are made available, because our social services departments\u2014children's social services in particular\u2014are overstretched. They are at breaking point\u2014make no bones about it\u2014and they are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect. We are having record numbers of contacts from police, from teachers, from doctors and, of course, from children themselves who are experiencing that harm and neglect. Equally, though, we don't want to lose sight of those families and children that are experiencing significant problems, but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes, and that is why it is important that there is investment in those programmes, so that children do not end up in that terrible position where we have to, for their safety, take them from their birth families to protect them. And the reality is, in Wales, that we are doing that to more children than we've done for a long time, and the numbers are growing across Wales. And that is only because of the most appalling neglect and abuse, because there is no way that any judge would permit us to act to make a child safe if it was not for that fact, and the facts are there. So, I don't want that focus to be lost, but, of course, we welcome and understand the need to progress this piece of legislation. dawn bowden am: That rise that you talk about here, is that due to more interventions, greater awareness, more incidents? I'm trying to link this to the Bill in terms of whether the Bill is actually going to give you more work to do in those areas. sally jenkins: On the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales, which are higher than those in England, and also the numbers of contacts that we have across the local authorities, the work of the care crisis review, which was completed last year; the work of Isabelle Trowler, who's the chief social worker in England; countless research and reports that have taken place in the last 18 months; and currently the public law working group, under the auspices of the president of the family court, would all indicate that it's multifactorial. So, what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales. There have been headlines that have said, 'Is it increased austerity?' That is clearly a part of this. Is it in Wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of, for example, domestic abuse? Is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households? All of that research would say it's all of those things. And then, when you also add in changes in our practice with our colleagues in the judiciary, changes in our police service, but also changes in our preventative services, you've got that whole range of elements. And there is going on across the local authorities and Welsh Government a huge amount of work to try to address and understand that, and then to ameliorate that. Children who need to be in care for safety need to be in care, but what we have to do is get to a point where fewer children come into care and we're able to protect them, firstly, and secondly where those children who are in care are cared for in a way that delivers the best possible outcomes for them. I think, in terms of this Bill and unintended consequences, I agree absolutely with everything that Huw has said. It takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay, and I think that's important to hang on to. alastair birch: One unintended consequences is that I think that there will be an increased focus on the UNCRC. And, in terms of children having a discussion around this point, children need to be part of that discussion. It's changed completely in the last 10 years, and it is\u00a0one of the key things in terms of us driving improvements. dawn bowden am: Would that be something that you would be looking to do in schools? alastair birch: Anything that improves the voice of the child in any educational context is good and it's very powerful for the children. And it improves their educational experiences, encouraging the opportunities for them to discuss the issues, the adverse childhood experiences that they encounter, which are significant, and it's our educational professionals that are facing this day-in, day-out. They've become a very highly trained workforce, they're ACE aware, they're trauma aware, and anything that focuses, even increases, their professionalism and understanding around a particular point, and also\u2014. So it's a positive unintended consequence, shall we say, that it could reinvigorate some of the voice of the child discussion within various contexts. lynne neagle am: We've got some specific questions now on implementation for social services, from Janet Finch-Saunders. If this Bill becomes law, would you encourage members of the public to contact social services departments if they do see a child being smacked? sally jenkins: We already encourage members of the public to contact social services or the police, depending on the circumstances. Interestingly, I'm picking\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: What, if a child is being smacked now? sally jenkins: Yes. But if you were walking out, and you saw something happening to a child, in the same way as if you saw something to an adult. sally jenkins: So, I think that the challenge is about\u2014we've all probably, sadly, witnessed incidents in the doctor's reception, or in a supermarket, and we've failed to do something about it. And I think we then walk away and feel pretty guilty about that, realistically, when you see something happening to a child in a particular circumstance. A campaign opposing this Bill, Be Reasonable Wales, have said that 'If the law is changed, the consequences for parents will be considerable.' It also says, 'Anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child\u2014under the new definition\u2014' so, I suppose you could argue, a minor tap\u2014 'will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma.' To what extent is this accurate, and, also, will thresholds for social services intervention change if the Bill is enacted? sally jenkins: There are a number of parts to that. Firstly, in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family's life, I think, for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently, even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse. What we do is we go in for short periods in families' lives, to support them to work with their strengths, to work with them and their family members. So, in terms of long-term intervention, what we want is for families to find their own solutions. We want families to be able to work with each other, and together, and local community support, and preventative services, to be able to address issues. In terms of thresholds for children's services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. Because we also know that this is actually quite a rare occurrence currently; this is not a defence that's being used with great frequency, this is not something that is happening. And if we look at the data, we know that the incidents of children, and the number of parents who now recognise this as an acceptable form of punishment, has steadily declined over the last 15 to 20 years. janet finch-saunders am: So, on that one then, is there a need for legislation that will\u2014obviously there'll be resources for the Welsh Government and there'll be resources out of hours and things like that\u2014is there a need for legislation if, as you say, natural behaviour and the culture is changing? Let's be honest, as you've rightly pointed out, in social services\u2014I know in my own authority\u2014in your own authority, you're saying that even now you're working with the police, on systematic failings within the system. Firstly, we want legislation that reflects our society\u2014we don't want the two to be out of kilter. It shouldn't be that we've got these rather confusing elements running in parallel, and that continues to perpetuate a lack of clarity and the ambiguity that we currently see. I think the other element is that, again, this is about potentially an accelerating of that awareness and that culture in our society, about how we care for our children.",
        " We've got there naturally; we've got there by the change that's happened in Wales over the last 15 to 20 years. What this does is to continue with that change and continue with that awareness and understanding of how we positively, from a strength-based approach, should care for our children, bearing in mind what's required of us in terms of the UNCRC. Are there any comments from anyone else? huw david: Simply to say that I think that, in terms of that clarity for the very vulnerable children out there who are currently being assaulted\u2014seriously assaulted and abused by their parents, which goes on on a daily basis\u2014that is already covered by existing legislation. But at the moment, they don't know, because they could be being told\u2014and they probably are being told\u2014by their parents that's it's okay, that they can smack their child and that that's acceptable. And if you asked most parents, and in fact lots of professionals, they would not be able to tell you, and probably most of you wouldn't be able to tell me exactly where is the threshold\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: Yes, where's that line. That vulnerable child, at home, being abused by their parents, does not know where that line is. And they should know where that line is because then they can pick up the phone to Childline or they can talk to a professional and ask them where that line is. I do recognise, though, that what we don't want to do\u2014and the last thing any of us want to do\u2014is criminalise parents who are bringing up their children. That is why we're saying there needs to be an emphasis on the support programmes that are available to parents. And to be clear, there is no way that we want long-term involvement in any child's life, but particularly not in the lives of children who have been smacked by their parents. That is not going to be the result of this legislation, trust me, because we don't want to be involved in\u2014we haven't got the resources to be involved in children's lives. The social worker or the police officer\u2014if they become involved, then there would be a proportionate response to that, and there'll also be a test about whether or not that is progressed. So, if there is an allegation\u2014if this legislation is passed\u2014then that will be looked into and a consideration will be made about whether any action will be taken, and as with any allegation of the law being broken, there would be a proportionate response, as there is now. Can you outline the practical ways in which social services' interaction with parents will change as a result of this proposed law and do you envisage that all referrals to the police will be automatically referred to social services for an assessment? Who's going to make those decisions? sally jenkins: That will be part of the implementation phase about that decision making. Interestingly, the number of referrals that we currently get from the police that we take absolutely no action on is extraordinary. It will be happening now; sitting in the civic centre in Newport City Council will be a whole host of social workers taking in the public protection notifications from overnight. janet finch-saunders am: So, if there's an increase as a result\u00a0of greater awareness\u2014 sally jenkins: What happens is there is a paper assessment of them. There's a look at what's happened, who's involved, what the police have reported, and there's work being done with the police to improve that. Because one of the things that we want to get to is actually where we're not using huge amounts of time to look at that, but what comes to us is what we act on. So, there is work going on with a number of police authorities to look at how you improve that process. But I suppose, to pick up, each incident will be looked at, each one will be assessed in a way that is proportionate, as Huw says, to look at what's happened and then investigated. lynne neagle am: Sally, can you give us a couple of examples of what kind of things might have come in that you would then take no action on? sally jenkins: We get countless referrals, for example, where there's been a domestic abuse incident overnight where a child wasn't present in the property and we then haven't taken action. It\u2019ll be where the level of harm that\u2019s perceived to happen to that child is below the threshold for intervention from children's services. janet finch-saunders am: I\u2019m pretty cynical about assessment, because, you know, I have people come in who are benefit claimants where, when they\u2019ve been assessed, the whole process has been very flawed and I\u2019ve had to fight and fight and fight on their behalf. So\u2014 sally jenkins: Assessment processes within social\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: But if you're struggling now with those assessments\u2014 sally jenkins: Assessment processes within social services are as laid out in the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. So, we have within what we carry out, I suppose, that kind of initial look, that look at the information, what else do we know about that family\u2014 janet finch-saunders am: And are they qualified people that are doing this? sally jenkins: Yes, absolutely. huw david: And, in fact, in lots of places in Wales now, it\u2019s a multi-agency assessment. janet finch-saunders am: So, what proportion currently would you not be taking any action on, if a report came in of some domestic abuse where a child had perhaps been smacked? sally jenkins: If something came in to us where a child had been smacked and there was something clearly there, we would look at it. lynne neagle am: Can you ask a final question? And I'm going to have to appeal for brief answers, because we've got a lot of ground to cover. huw david: Just very quickly, there may be no action from social services, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t offer support. So, the expectation is that support is offered in those circumstances from family support services, for example\u2014 sally jenkins: Or prevention. So, we would not say, if we were aware, for example, that there was domestic abuse at a home, \u2018There\u2019s no role for children\u2019s social services\u2019, because there may be an assessment that that child may not be at immediate risk of harm, but we would obviously recognise that there are causes for concern there and we would offer that support. And that\u2019s a process that happens in every social services department in the UK, and it\u2019s happened for a very long time, and, in fact, it\u2019s reflective of the legislation that you have laid down as Assembly Members. lynne neagle am: And are those services there, Huw? Because I\u2019m very acutely aware of the pressure on local government. Are the services there? Is there sufficient resource in things like Families First? Because what I\u2019m hearing on the ground is that eligibility is changing for even those preventative services. huw david: There\u2019s not enough of those services, and, obviously\u2014you may have heard me saying this before\u2014I think we need to invest more in those services, and I hope you invest more in the services, because, obviously, prevention is better than cure. And those pressures that Sally talked about earlier are pressures that are not going away; they\u2019re only increasing by the day, actually, and I would want us to be able to offer those services now. Because that example of a child that perhaps is in a home where there is domestic abuse\u2014we\u2019ll probably have another referral off them in a couple of months\u2019 time, and that could escalate. And what I\u2019d rather do is provide support to that family and try and stop that family breaking down so that, in six months, we're not going back and saying that we've got to take this child into care because the domestic abuse has worsened and that child is at risk. sally jenkins: I appreciate that time is of the essence, but, just really quickly in relation to that, it\u2019s not just social services. So, for example, there are developments like Encompass, which is a piece of work that is being rolled out across Gwent and across other areas, which is where the police automatically notify the school overnight of an incident, not expecting the school to do anything per se, but to be aware, to be able to offer care for that child. alastair birch: Can I add to that? Operation Encompass I know in Gwent has been operational, and we started it in Pembrokeshire 18 months ago. We as a local authority\u2014and it\u2019ll be education that will contact the school around the domestic incident happening, and the school as part of that protocol will provide a level of universal service support for that child when they come in, before 9 o\u2019clock, so that professionals are aware of the needs of the welfare of that child at that point. So, you know, schools play a key role in the universal service of this and we work very closely with our social care colleagues on that. janet finch-saunders am: The Bill's explanatory memorandum refers to an estimate of 274 offences annually where lawful chastisement was used as a defence or considered. It says there is also potential to create extra demand on out-of-hours social services teams due to the time that the offences were reported, and in order to support safeguarding measures. Have you assessed how this Bill will impact on emergency and out-of-hours local authority services? sally jenkins: We have considered that, and again I think that's something that we would very much want to look at as part of implementation. We have out-of-hours provision, we have emergency duty teams already across Wales that operate 24/7. janet finch-saunders am: Are they overstretched at the moment? sally jenkins: I think in the same way as all of social services is. But are they working in a way that protects children day in, day out, and vulnerable adults? Yes, they are, and they will continue to do so. Alastair, you've already mentioned about awareness raising and training, which will be key with educational professionals. How confident are you that teachers and others working in those educational settings will be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill, if enacted? alastair birch: Training requirements for all professionals in education settings are clear. In that level of general safeguarding awareness and training, the infinite emphasis is on the duty to report. It says in 'Keeping learners safe', which is the bible in terms of education professionals, that there's a responsibility on the professional to make that referral and for that universal service. So, the more specialist safeguarding leads within the schools, who have become highly skilled professionals in terms of understanding what might be significant harm\u2014because that's what we're talking about\u2014they understand the legalities when a referral needs to be made. There's always the collation of safeguarding information, where there might be just general concerns about neglect and other areas, which combined would create a picture that there might be significant neglect or significant harm to the child, and then that referral would be made to the child care assessment team or the police. So, that awareness\u2014it needs to be clear for educational professionals that that duty to report is always there. If they believe that that significant harm has happened then that report then goes to the child care assessment team. But in terms of education, it'll be that awareness, making sure that there's clarity. If there's anything that professionals need to be trained additionally on, it'll need to go into 'Keeping learners safe', which at the moment is being rewritten. But as long as there's clarity, and once that implementation phase and the discussion has happened, as long as it's clear for professionals that the duty is always there and they feel a significant harm, then that report will always be there and will always need to be made. It's making sure\u2014and I'll echo what my colleague said, Huw\u2014that the services are key for families. On a daily basis, professionals are working on that trust with parents, because they are the ones that can engage with those families. The family support officers that are working on the ground with highly complex families, with multiple leads and supporting the children\u2014they are fundamental, and investment in that level of support would also help our colleagues as well. That is already happening in schools and is effective, and is shown to be effective, and has an evidence base\u2014we'd always support that that would continue to be invested in. And you were saying about how important trust is as well, but do you think that there's a risk that those in education settings will have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which some have said could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust? alastair birch: I don't think it's a matter of mistrust\u2014it's a matter of, you know, if a professional believes, based on the evidence that they have, because they're working with that child every day, that there is significant harm to that child, they are under a duty to report that to social care. So, part of the work is with families, and most of the referrals we make are with parental consent. That consent is a key element of this, and conversation with our social care colleagues is usually, 'You need to speak to the parents again and have a conversation with them.' Some of the NFAs\u2014the ones that don't get referred at threshold\u2014it will come back to school for, possibly, some support from the family or a team around the family or some other aspect. The trust in the professionals\u2014it's actually more important that we are seen to be upholding our duties under the all-Wales safeguarding procedures. We're going to move on now to some questions about the importance of awareness raising from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. In looking at your written evidence, you say that we must make it very clear to parents, guardians and the public that this legislation is not trying to criminalise parents, and that is clearly very important for you. How do you think we should do that and who should be doing that work? sally jenkins: I think that's really broad. Obviously, colleagues in education, colleagues in social care, colleagues in preventative services, but also Welsh Government and the National Assembly, in terms of those drivers in relation to that awareness raising are really, really key. If you look at some of the other campaigns that have been run, notably in relation to violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence, and echoing some of those building campaigns that have been done to raise awareness\u2014I think those would be really good models to begin to consider in terms of how this is taken forward with awareness. We also know that there are a number of routes that we can go through in terms of raising awareness. We have existing preventative services, we have all our universal services, we have the regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards. In terms of not wishing to criminalise, I think if we look at the numbers, they are very, very small. And I think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or isn't likely to happen once or if this Bill ever gets to the point of Royal Assent\u2014they are small numbers who currently use this defence. It is about that wider issue of awareness raising, and using all of those avenues will help us to do that in the broadest sense. sian gwenllian am: Do you, therefore, believe that this needs to be on the face of the Bill? That is, you don't say this in your evidence. Scotland is going to be making it a duty for Scottish Ministers to raise awareness of the impact of the Bill. Wouldn't it make it clearer for you if it was a clear duty on the face of the Bill, for example as it was with the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013? There was a duty in that Act for Ministers to promote transplantation. Surely, that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the Bill. Do you have an opinion on that? huw david: Well, Welsh Government have given that commitment, and I know the Welsh Government honour every commitment that they make\u2014[Laughter.] sian gwenllian am: That's why I'm asking. huw david: I don't know whether that is necessary\u2014I'm not a legislator. I think that there's obviously an inherent interest in Welsh Government raising awareness, because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful, otherwise we will have parents who feel that they're being criminalised, and that's the last thing we want. I think it's worthy of consideration, but, as I say, I'm not a legislator or a lawyer, so I don't know what implications that will have long term. But to be fair to Welsh Government, I think that commitment is one that I'm sure will be honoured, because Welsh Government will want to make a success of this Bill if it does receive Royal Assent. But is it clear who would pay for all of that? huw david: I've suddenly changed my mind\u2014[Laughter.] I think it should be a duty on Welsh Government Ministers\u2014absolutely. And that's the WLGA position; I don't need to ask the other 21 leaders on that either. [Laughter.] sian gwenllian am: Wouldn't it make it clearer if there was a clear duty on the face of the Bill that awareness raising had to happen? It would be clearer, then, for local authorities and people in the front-line services what needs to happen. We're moving on now, then, to the contentious issue of resources and we've got some questions from Hefin. hefin david am: Sally Jenkins, you said that the purpose of the Bill is to bring clarity and to remove what is a little-used defence. Isn't this an expensive way of doing that? sally jenkins: I don't think so, no. hefin david am: But introducing this legislation diverts finances from other areas of children's services\u2014or doesn't? sally jenkins: Well, I would say, no, I don't think it will divert resources from children's services. Firstly, going back to the comment made, I think, proportionally, this is a very small number of cases. It's a very small number of existing cases that go through in terms of prosecution, or consideration for prosecution. We know that it's likely, from some of the work that we've already done, that it's not opening floodgates for a sudden sea of referrals to children's services\u2014that's not the way this is going to be, because the numbers are not out there because of the changes that have already happened in Welsh family life and Welsh society. So, I think as part of the implementation phase, we need to have a really clear understanding of the trajectory of those costs and what's likely to happen over the first six months, 12 months in terms of people's awareness and understanding and what is referred and how that's worked. But in terms of a huge number, no, I don't anticipate it being that. hefin david am: But the costs wouldn't just be directed to the number of referrals and the number of cases raised, it's the cost around that, with training of staff, awareness\u2014all those extra additional costs that always come with legislation. And I agree with that\u2014that there clearly are\u2014but if you think, many of those things will be aligned with work we are already doing, but it brings a clarity to that work. So, our teachers, our social workers, our health workers, our police officers already get substantial training around child protection, around safeguarding, around adverse childhood experiences and around a trauma-informed approach to children. But rather than having a part of that training, which has to deal with this as an aspect\u2014that is no longer there; it is a clear message for all professions. hefin david am: I fully appreciate that, and in the briefing note you've given us, you've outlined the pressures on social services. So, do you think this is another way of getting money into social services? sally jenkins: If this was a way of getting money into\u2014. I think this is a clear commitment to the rights of children in Wales; this is not about levering additional resources into children's services. And, do you think those costs are quantifiable? sally jenkins: I think we are currently looking at work and are doing work across my own local authority and across two others to look at breaking down those costs, not just for local authority, but also for health, for police and for Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru. I think there was a bit about local authorities that Si\u00e2n\u2014 lynne neagle am: Okay. The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill talks about the unknown costs for different agencies. You mentioned there that you're doing work around trying to identify some of those costs, but wouldn't it be useful if the explanatory memorandum did explain more about any unknown or unidentified costs, partly in order to calm some of those fears around that? Giving a title 'unidentified costs'\u2014is that good enough? sally jenkins: I think, clearly, that is a challenge, and that is work that we are participating in and are committed to completing with Welsh Government, to look at what those costs are. huw david: I think this is where it would be helpful in the committee's deliberations and where our concern would be, because the reality is we're not going to know what the costs are until it's actually implemented, because we haven't implemented this before. And, therefore, I think there needs to be a commitment that, whatever the costs are, those costs are met because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales. And whilst we don't see it as levering in additional resources, we don't think it should be at the expense of current service provision to vulnerable families in Wales, and therefore it's important that it is properly and fully resourced. sian gwenllian am: What I would argue on that is that you have to try and forecast. You say it's difficult to forecast how much this is going to cost, but we have to try and forecast that, and part of the argument for trying to have projections is to show that, perhaps, it's not going to cost that much, and that would add to the argument that, 'Okay, this is going to be fine to do and it's not going to put too much pressure on us'. Or we need to know that this is going to cost a lot to do it effectively, and therefore you have to make your argument, then, 'Well, we can't afford that, the money has to come from somewhere else.' We have to get the costs, surely. huw david: Yes, and we will work very closely with Welsh Government to try and establish those costs as quickly as possible. So, for example, a campaign, an awareness-raising campaign, the marketing, if you like, but some of the other costs will be more difficult to establish in terms of the resource implications for front-line workers. I expressed a view that we need to see some additional investment in some of those programmes that are not targeted directly at families that would be impacted by this but support all families across Wales that have different needs, and some of that provision is universal. So, there's no limit to that, but I suspect Welsh Government will take a very different view to that. But I don't put an upper limit on that, because I don't think there's an authority in Wales, and I don't think there's a charity, a police service or a health board in Wales that doesn't think that we need to do more of that and could offer more of that if the resources were available. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you all for attending and for answering all of our questions? It's been a really useful and informative discussion. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for coming. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Housing and Local Government\u2014additional information for our inquiry into school funding. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services on in-patient child and adolescent mental health services provision, and I would like to briefly return to that when we go into private. Item 4, then: can I propose a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."

        "marketing: What's the agenda for this meeting ? project manager: The I will  present here agenda with with with with slides to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and  I was about to send them you but then  I had to go to this  meeting so you will get them too  marketing: project manager: Then I hope you all have  worked out some some  some some presentations about  about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .  then I will  bring in some some some new requirements I I got  from the  account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . project manager: and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the marketing:  . industrial designer: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? project manager: Yes  well yes w who are we going to  to well to sell this , marketing:  . So And then  we will close this meeting  user interface: project manager: and after this meeting we'll  we'll have a lunch . Maybe  why  Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? marketing: No , I don't . project manager:  you want a table to to  marketing: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . project manager: Yes yes maybe maybe you can  can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary  . Well I've just been  presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it .  seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . project manager: Do you Do you have this  information on the web page you said ? marketing: I have an a web page yes . So basically  there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .  , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times  and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Teletext is used  fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . marketing: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that  fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . industrial designer: marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . industrial designer: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's marketing: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . industrial designer: Not enough marketing: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . What do you mean there ? marketing: For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . project manager: But it's it's the opinion of the  of the users huh ? marketing: Yeah . marketing:  and then it's got a demographic breakdown on industrial designer: Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the marketing:  I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . user interface: You can disconnect it there project manager: You can maybe just just user interface: no ? marketing: Oh no , yeah . industrial designer: Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file marketing: Yeah . industrial designer: So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional  user interface: Oh yeah . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . industrial designer: Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the  both yeah user interface and functional design . marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute . industrial designer: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint  our design based on what is more important . industrial designer: Speech recognition in marketing: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . industrial designer: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control marketing: Well potentially yeah ,  project manager: user interface: industrial designer: it would be all based on speech . project manager: Well it would it would be a solution for  when your remote control is lost , marketing: project manager:  when it has speech recognition then  i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . industrial designer: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? user interface: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is  it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , project manager:  . project manager: Yes , user interface: It's it's going to be li project manager: that that that that's  . user interface: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case project manager: Do you have some more important facts user interface: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi marketing:  project manager: or can we go to the next presentation ? industrial designer: Okay . So marketing: Well industrial designer: you had to to to summarise maybe the marketing: This is now talking about  who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it ,  . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,  twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . marketing: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , user interface: project manager:  . industrial designer: I thi You us marketing: It'll be in a different window , yep . marketing: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .  I okay project manager: Oh , industrial designer: I stay project manager: this is user interface: Now you can move I think yeah . user interface: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , marketing: Sorry ? Oh .  I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very  technical background  what is it because I think in the product it is important . industrial designer: So basically  the basic function of a remote control is to send  messages to another system that is fixed . industrial designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually  through a  infrared bit marketing: So my method for  designing the yeah the work design  yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional  capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . industrial designer: So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing  Expert  Anna marketing: industrial designer: and  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions  for this remote control and I show you the the working design .  we want an on off button , it can be  it's simple but it's it's important , and also  the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , marketing:  . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is  will be to well my aim would be to  design the and choose the chips and the infrared  components to build the remote control marketing: This is very quick  design ,  you stop me or interrupt me if  you don't agree on it on that . industrial designer: And  so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this  schema marketing: Well . industrial designer: that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me marketing: You drew it a long time ago ? industrial designer: you know . industrial designer: And  that's it so I won't go into details about that project manager: overwhelming . So project manager: are they cheap , or are they  reliable ? What were your industrial designer: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with  reliability and  i if it's expensive , project manager:  . industrial designer: but  this one was not this one also really  reliable  so yeah that's it for the working design ,  I hope you get clearer view on  what what a remote control is  in terms of  technical components project manager: Yes . industrial designer: but maybe yeah project manager: So user interface: But is it  can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma industrial designer: No no no no we we will  This is a preference but we can always change  project manager: What I w what I was thinking about  the the the schema  about  the sender and the receiver ,  can you can you get back to it ? industrial designer: Yeah . project manager: Yeah  , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not  able to change it . We will use  infrared protocol  using yeah infrared and  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists project manager: industrial designer: and but we what we can do is   adapting the the chips inside  to the best  chips and  infrared bubbles . Of course yeah user interface: But you should be careful , industrial designer: in the chip you have it yeah . user interface: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote    which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . user interface: So maybe we should think of marketing: industrial designer: Of course yeah we should take that into account marketing: That's handy . project manager: Yeah yes marketing: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . industrial designer: in the  user interface: Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away industrial designer: user interface: You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . project manager: I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this  th these things . So  I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , marketing: user interface: so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have  keys or buttons with which people can  press and then  changing a button will basically  change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and   industrial designer: So p as  Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is  s a question which will we have to see later . user interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . user interface: And  so generally  I don't have some figures sorry but  so there are two kinds of  remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play ,  volume change and  keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now   even the one  on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but   . Then there is  this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing ,  which which you can vouch . And then you have  what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop  and then you play the movie or  or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those marketing: And then well personal preferences I would  basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the  the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because  some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that  we could  aim for the like in the f coming future  that type of  applications with marketing: Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , user interface: marketing: so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , user interface: Yeah . marketing: so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? user interface: Yeah . marketing: or does it know which one you want to use ? user interface:  actually  you could you could think of  having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing marketing: user interface: but   yo you you you still can't  in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option marketing: user interface: and you could play it or You can also think about having like  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate  sitting setup box marketing: user interface: and  you have   something like   you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you marketing: user interface: and  you can just you know  when you come back you could just switch on that thing and  watch a program . user interface: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . user interface: It's the next generation thing , project manager:  yes , user interface: but it is going to come in couple of years . project manager: but I think it's i i it's already there , user interface: It's goi project manager:  the hard disk  recorders  I I've seen them in the shop . user interface: it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both   video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . That's , user interface: No no we are not making a universal remote , marketing: yeah . user interface: we are just looking at  giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box marketing:  . user interface: which is going to sit there and  it's going to do that job for me . Because y project manager: W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . project manager: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible  future p  prospects marketing:  . So we can always discuss about it for example  the presently the video market actually  this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually industrial designer: user interface: so it i like people are providing like  things like   movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and  your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . user interface: and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . industrial designer: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed  online  yeah . user interface: Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie marketing:  . project manager: I have  received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and  I would like to share them with you . project manager: first thing is  teletext is a well known feature of televisions marketing: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent  prominent  place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . project manager:  as  a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . project manager: further yes we must think ,  do we stay  to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back  huh , or do we   go further as Matthew indicated by supporting   recording  devices ? user interface: marketing: So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? project manager:  indeed indeed .  , furthermore , w we need really need to interest  y younger customers and then with younger customers  people  below the age of forty , marketing: project manager: So industrial designer: So project manager: that's to that's  there's a market but  they will grow older older marketing: project manager: and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . project manager:  therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be  have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . user interface: Yeah it's  well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , marketing: user interface: but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys marketing:  . user interface: you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and  basically   so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually industrial designer: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , user interface: Yeah so . Yes yes marketing: that's the the the  the new and the funky things , project manager: mo industrial designer: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . marketing: that's , project manager: Yes it's recognisable industrial designer: Yeah . marketing: yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . So , for example you have  presently  keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and   four five six like that and  you can have keys like this in form like  keys like that project manager: Mael can you hand me over this  ? industrial designer: Yes . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? project manager:  well marketing: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all project manager: I think fi five min user interface: Forty minutes ? marketing: and it's a very important issue . too sorry , so we basically don't change the  original order of them industrial designer: user interface: but then the keys are more spacious , marketing: user interface: they don't look  so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three ,  four , sorry four here  five and six , marketing:  . user interface: so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice industrial designer: user interface: but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to project manager: Okay . industrial designer: marketing: basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control user interface: Yeah . marketing: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? user interface: project manager: Of course they have already one . marketing: 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . I well I think many people said  in your in in your research    the appearance of the  R_C_ is is important when they are buying one marketing:  . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . marketing: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . project manager: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance marketing: Well , we can't , with the price range . project manager: What do What do you think about What componen industrial designer: Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros  per  per R_ s R_C_ marketing:  . industrial designer: and I think  with this now you know that chips are very  cheaps marketing: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that industrial designer: that's marketing: which would drive the cost up a lot . industrial designer: Ye project manager: Is the L_C_D_ screen marketing: For universal remotes industrial designer: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . project manager: I think thi this could be this could be a market because  universal remote controls  tend to be  quite expensive . marketing: And quite complicated to use , project manager: S so we can try to go in between , marketing: yes . project manager: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal   R_C_ industrial designer: Universal . project manager: marketing: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . project manager:  yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . project manager: I think  when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . project manager: So d Do you agree ? user interface: Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is  not too expensive . industrial designer: Yeah user interface:  and it d  Our provin industrial designer: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell  four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers  the price of a chip is  price of a chip is very cheap . industrial designer: So I'm okay for designing  a ne  less yeah a a kind of universal  R_C_ yeah . And  basically you can look to the standards of other industrial designer: Yeah that's needed , yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . user interface: Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . project manager: So given we are going for this   universal type  m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific  user interface content industrial designer: Yes . project manager: and  maybe you can look on on what trends are in this  in this type of market . user interface: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good marketing: project manager: W yes , user interface: for the project manager: we  we can have lunch now . project manager: So  Then th th the next meeting will  user interface: Yeah so we meet in well what are our project manager: after lunch you have  we have  thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting "

        "Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19, I've determined that the public are excluded from the committee's meeting, in order to protect public health. In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM, the Minister for Health and Social Services; Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Albert Heaney, deputy director general of the health and social services group; Nicola Edwards, deputy director, childcare, play and early years; Jean White, chief nursing officer; and Tracey Breheny, who is deputy director of mental health, substance misuse and vulnerable groups. We've got lots of questions that we'd like to cover, which we'll go straight into, with questions from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools? vaughan gething am: Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales\u2014a child who's in critical care\u2014but that isn't confirmed. But the generals still apply\u2014that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area. sian gwenllian am: And in terms\u2014[Inaudible.] vaughan gething am: Chair. Sorry\u2014with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee. lynne neagle am: Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Si\u00e2n could repeat her question? vaughan gething am: I can hear it, yes. lynne neagle am: Okay, Si\u00e2n, would you mind repeating that, please? sian gwenllian am: Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus\u2014let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales\u2014do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children? vaughan gething am: At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care\u2014. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. But the challenge in all of that this is\u2014it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped.\u00a0If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment\u2014you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day. lynne neagle am: [Inaudible.]\u2014Si\u00e2n? sian gwenllian am: Hello. Right, we'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden. Minister, just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us. How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that? vaughan gething am: We've had to look at some specifics around communication, so challenges about not just different languages, but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment, and it's really challenging. We've had to think about the way it works, and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse. I understand people's fear and anxiety, but that then means that their family, and in particular their child, isn't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have. So, there's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through. That's actually about rebuilding people's confidence in the service, and that isn't straightforward because there's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating. But I think for us it's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service. We've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family, please discuss your concerns with them. There are times you need to be physically in the same place, for example on routine vaccinations, because we certainly haven't stopped that programme either, and I really wouldn't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we've done is that if parents don't engage with that service, we could potentially see a rise in other diseases. We're all, I think\u2014not just you\u00a0in your constituency, but others who are on this call and\u00a0others as well\u2014seeing an occasional reappearance of measles, and that's because people didn't engage with the vaccination programme. I don't want, either myself or a different health Minister in the future, to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in. So, I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations, but recently, through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families, that trend seems to have turned and there's now a much better attendance. One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations. So, yes, there was a bit of a downturn, but it does seem to be improving at the moment. We're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. sian gwenllian am: It's a cause of great concern to us all, of course, in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people. So, what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place? vaughan gething am: Again, I think it's helpful that you've already heard from the education Minister last week, because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children. So, children's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister. Part of the honest challenge, again, is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact. So, we're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference. Until we have more contact with families, we may not fully understand that, and that's a real point of concern for me. In all of the unknowns within this, the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them, because we're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health, how we support people, and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need, and then how we need to think about that. Obviously, it's a key factor for their return to school, but, actually, for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment, and that will be difficult because we're going to phase out of lockdown\u2014it's not going to be a one-hit measure. We're going to be looking at, at each point, what difference has been made, what more we can do. And, again, there are the efforts we're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services\u2014that we keep on reminding people that they're there and are available, and we want people to make use of them, because I know, as this committee said, we'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future. sian gwenllian am: So, in reality, there's been no assessment undertaken because it's difficult to do that. So, the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis\u2014you don't know what they are at the moment as things stand. vaughan gething am: We can't know, because we don't have that level of contact. I wouldn't say that no work's being done, but I couldn't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture. If I tried to say that, then I'm sure you'd ask me, 'How on earth can you say that? If you're not having regular contact with people, you can't possibly understand the picture.' And it's much better to say, 'We don't understand the full picture. We're working alongside health boards and others, but we'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families.' I'll look at a variety of different areas, again, both to reform the recovery plan, but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future, and the picture that we're seeing isn't straightforward and we need to make sure that we don't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we'd want to be. sian gwenllian am: But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister? vaughan gething am: Of course. Not just on the work we've done in the past; not just because it's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools, but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and to move forwards, that we don't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we haven't thought about what that will look like. In amongst all the other priorities I have, I'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten. sian gwenllian am: And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS, for example, in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus? vaughan gething am: No, we've actually got\u2014. Maybe perhaps it might be helpful, Chair, if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we're monitoring the impact we have, in terms of we've got a reporting tool, but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services. Yes, on that question, we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place, as the Minister said, a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards, so through that tool, we look at that every week in terms of collecting information. Whilst national reporting's been stood down, we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services, referral numbers and so on, so we do have that tool in place, and at the moment, that's telling us that the system can meet the capacity; has the capacity to meet need. sian gwenllian am: Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak? tracey breheny: There has been some movement, as I'm saying, around health boards, particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision, providing critical care, but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week, those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever, or from different parts of the system. sian gwenllian am: And then, what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients? Because that's what I'm hearing, that there has been such a reduction, but how are those patients then treated and served? tracey breheny: In terms of in-patient capacity, that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment. There were some discharges of young people, but we've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place. sian gwenllian am: And finally in this section from me, given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services, how can young people access appropriate services\u2014online services, for example? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment? vaughan gething am: Well, we've not closed off general practice and, as you know, we've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner. We've expanded a range of telephone advice services, so the telephone advice service we already provide, we've made sure that's maintained, and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions. I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas. That is, again, a worry for me, but the communications we have within the health and care system, people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available, and actually, as I say, we've expanded that right across our healthcare system. Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is, I don't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services. Of course, most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already. sian gwenllian am: But, of course, there will be some who are missed; they may fall between two stools because they won\u2019t know where to turn. vaughan gething am: Yes, and that, again, comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context, with their families, to know where support and advice and guidance is. Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they can't find advice somewhere else, so that's why there's the information we're providing through general practice to signpost people, so those pathways haven\u2019t been closed off. It's about making sure that people have alternative means that they\u2019re prepared to use at this point in time. If we go back to where we started this evidence session, we were talking about the difficulty of families who don't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home. So, there's a real challenge about how we make the service available, but then encourage people to take it up, so that we don\u2019t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point. I've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies, and can I remind Ministers about concise answers, please? Suzy. Just as we're speaking about children and young people's mental health, I wonder if you can confirm whether you've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people, and whether the operational guidance you've given out is responding to that in any way, or maybe there was something in that that you hadn\u2019t thought of and you can respond to as we go along. vaughan gething am: I, personally, haven't read that advice, but the Government's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions. You don't need to be a parent to recognise that that\u2019s a potential issue for children and young people. I haven't read it, but that's been signposted, so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we're already adopting, because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources, including the UN, the World Health Organization and others. But, as you know, Minister, the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart. Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic? vaughan gething am: Apart from the general concern that I've expressed on mental health generally, we are already investigating, we're having a\u2014. We've commissioned, through the Government, the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group, including Dr Ann John and other people, to review the current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. So, that's why we've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have, so we're able then to provide a report to understand where we are. My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and, obviously, I know the committee\u2019s got an interest, so if it's helpful we can write to you once we've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it. In terms of provision of crisis care, then, how has that been impacted by the pandemic? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment? vaughan gething am: Yes, they continue to be available. We've made clear that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time, and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health. Moving on to perinatal mental health, this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period, but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother, let alone in a pandemic. We've also been looking at how that's provided on a phone or online basis where possible, because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people. So, we're looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that we've made. And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frame\u2014that is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now. lynne neagle am: Is the Welsh Government aware that there's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision, and will you be taking that into account in your planning? Because, obviously, we wouldn't want people to think that was because of a lack of need; it's down to fear and the lockdown. vaughan gething am: Yes, we're aware there's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service\u2014or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase\u2014because we know that's the same with a range of other areas. There aren't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus. So, I certainly wouldn't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create. Obviously, we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and the\u2014there are two funds, aren't there, for third sector organisations? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people, and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the \u00a36.3 million for hospices is for children's hospices? I don't mind who answers that one. Certainly, I'm sure the committee is aware, as Suzy has said, of the funds that are available for third sector services. The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip, of course, announced on 6 April the \u00a324 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund, and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government. They can also benefit from the \u00a3400 million economic resilience fund, but I am aware that some groups don't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that. So, we've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA, such as the voluntary services emergency fund, which supports volunteering, and the third sector resilience fund, supporting organisations to stay afloat. We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services, care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises. Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers, and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines. And, actually, about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19. The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children's social services at the start of the lockdown period, but, since then, the numbers have actually risen. Meic, Action for Children, and, of course, Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package.",
        " In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children, I can't give you an actual figure for that, but, certainly, there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children. vaughan gething am: It's about \u00a31.5 million from the \u00a36.3 million that's gone to T\u0177 Gobaith and T\u0177 Hafan, Suzy. Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister, when she's in a position to do so, to let us have a note. Before we finish on this point, could I ask the Deputy Minister, again, about whether any of the things you've been talking about now is additional money, because, obviously, you mentioned yourself one of these funds is \u00a324 million. So, again, if you don't have the answer to hand, perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in. I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there, and the \u00a324 million is for support and extra help. dawn bowden am: Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authorities\u2014you know, schools and health services\u2014to report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done. professor jean white: Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. dawn bowden am: Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. Do you think that needs revisiting at all? julie morgan am: The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care\u2014the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern? julie morgan am: Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating\u00a0risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks? julie morgan am: It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced \u00a33 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed? julie morgan am: Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it\u2019s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines? julie morgan am: We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care\u2014I mentioned them before\u2014have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now\u2014that they have contact with. janet finch-saunders am: So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please? julie morgan am: Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things\u2014have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister, I think, about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed, about which children's rights impact assessments have been done. Have any been done, and can they be shared with the committee if they have? Sorry, Deputy Minister\u2014my mistake. julie morgan am: Well, it's been a very difficult time, as you appreciate, in terms of having to make legislation very quickly, and it hasn't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do. And this is to try to get from children their views of what's happened, what we've been doing, and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation. So, we're doing this in conjunction with the children's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament. So, this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children, and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them, what they feel about what's happened during this period, what they feel about the way that we've dealt with the schools, the way that they've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long. So, I'm very pleased that we're doing that, but, in terms of an impact assessment, it has been very difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine, to be able to do those at these times. Just to say for the committee, really importantly, that we haven't introduced any easements in relation to children's services legislation. So, from a Welsh context, the standards that are in place do remain, so therefore there wouldn't have been a necessity for us to do a children's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation. I think that's particularly a strong point to us in Wales, both in terms of safeguarding arrangements, but also ensuring that children's rights are protected at a crucial time. In terms of childcare and education, we're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements, and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those. Obviously, the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments, but, in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\u2014and I think Albert was just saying the same thing\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward. Well, just to come back on that then, are you saying to me that, as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we've had, no assessments for children's needs have been postponed, cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person? julie morgan am: Well, I think, as Albert said, that there was no relaxation of regulation for children's social care. There's no relaxation, but what's happening in practice? We're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\u2014who's doing the children's needs assessments, particularly for young carers? julie morgan am: Well, I\u2014. Albert, can you answer that? albert heaney: I think the first thing to say to the committee is that, going back, we took a very strong line at the beginning that we weren't going to introduce easements in requirements to children's social services. Of course, through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate, they are having to operate through a different time. So, assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns; assessments are still taking place, and especially in relation to\u2014as you mentioned\u2014young carers, to support their needs. So, arrangements\u2014[Inaudible.] But they're having to be slightly differently done\u2014so, some of the technology, and keeping in contact and keeping those visits. So, we've used, for example, the St David's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well. So, we're having to be a little bit more\u2014and social services departments are having to be a little bit more\u2014innovative in the use of technology in the way that they've engaged as well. But personal visits are taking place, and visits especially, as the Minister mentioned earlier on\u2014they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits, to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time. I don't want to take this much further, but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic. Have they been accepted by Government, and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day, Deputy Minister? julie morgan am: Well, those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group. I've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues, and we are setting up this group, as you know, and we will be looking at those issues in the group. Any steal on when that might report? julie morgan am: I don't have that at the moment. Can I just say, we are running short of time? We did start late, so, if the Ministers are happy, we'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.\u20143.10 p.m.\u2014if that's okay. sian gwenllian am: [Inaudible.] lynne neagle am: Hold on a sec, Si\u00e2n, we've lost translation again. sian gwenllian am: You will know, Deputy Minister\u2014because we have discussed this in private session\u2014my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector, and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis, as families start to return to the workplace. There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and aren't receiving financial support. Do you agree\u2014are there people who are still not being supported, and why isn't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector? julie morgan am: Thank you, Si\u00e2n, for that question. Basically, we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops. So, that is guaranteed to them, and they are able to take advantage of the Government's job retainer scheme, but that does mean that there is a problem, as I think we've discussed before, of the double funding issue, and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this. I'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute, because she's much more up to date with the discussions about that, but, so far, I don't think very much progress has been made on that. But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector, and I'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip, who is responsible for the voluntary sector, because obviously many of the groups that we're talking about would come under the voluntary sector, because they have voluntary committees, but they fall between many stools, because they rent premises rather than own premises and they don't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants. So, some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme, but certainly not all of them; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund, and, as the Deputy Minister said, we're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding. All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government's coronavirus job retention scheme, but there are some complications around that in that it's a salary-based scheme and you can't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff. So, if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff's salary, you can't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well, and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances, which we're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that. Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings, but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can. We're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next, the recovery and the return of the sector, and we've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well. sian gwenllian am: I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector? julie morgan am: Well, that is what we're looking to see\u2014if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Si\u00e2n, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this. sian gwenllian am: And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers? julie morgan am: I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so\u2014. , that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics. nicola edwards: I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them? julie morgan am: Yes, that would be very good. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way? julie morgan am: Well, that is the intention\u2014that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please. suzy davies am: Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the\u2014well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that? julie morgan am: Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really\u2014that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising. lynne neagle am: Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward"

B did you send us an email about this ? project manager: not yet , user interface: industrial designer: project manager: but if you want user interface: Yeah , we we received an email about this  d designs . project manager: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? industrial designer: user interface: Ah it's Okay . marketing: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . user interface: 'Kay , we can project manager: So there are so we have three user interface: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . project manager: So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ? industrial designer: I think our  responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . user interface: Are you using the you are doing the in industrial designer: Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . It was a little confusion about my  project manager: user interface: Ah industrial designer: but it's alright . industrial designer: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done project manager: industrial designer: and what are your ideas about the project manager: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? industrial designer: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . industrial designer: Yeah , I dunno I project manager: And of course it should not be very costly . industrial designer: Well I I think that Norman and I would think about  the technical points and  we should discuss it in the next meeting , or user interface: Need to collect information .  , what is most important in a in a remote control ? What is the most important function aspect ?  . project manager: You won't user interface: Or or you can say for example ,  I want  to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of  remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . project manager: I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . user interface: No , because no , project manager: S user interface: it's not very a lot . industrial designer: I I think if you want t to choose  from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use  w  I dunno marketing: I'm a okay . marketing:  the main  function of remote control is to have something in the hand project manager: In the hand . marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog user interface: Yeah . marketing: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . industrial designer: marketing:  we have some or something , different technology but project manager: This is it's user interface: Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that  there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . industrial designer: Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea project manager: industrial designer: but I I think that technically it would be  a little bit   more tricky to to achieve this than just to user interface: No . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . user interface: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . industrial designer: Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to  navigate  through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so project manager: This is good idea . Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? industrial designer: Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen user interface: Good idea . industrial designer: and just  with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f user interface: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . project manager: industrial designer: user interface: Because all the T_V_  the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff user interface: Okay . project manager: So we have five minutes to user interface: Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . project manager: Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we industrial designer: user interface: Five minutes . marketing: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of user interface: Okay . marketing: So , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark  some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . industrial designer: Oh right so user interface: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? project manager: Yeah . project manager: Be before before writing you can  sit and that says what we what we said user interface:  . So so the most functional des  the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . The user can choose w which one they want , right ? industrial designer: Yeah , by content or by channel , user interface: By content or by channel . user interface: Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . industrial designer: I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so user interface: Okay . And  industrial designer: I think that's the the things to do user interface: The main thing . user interface: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get  the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . project manager: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? And we'll discuss the other other aspects "
