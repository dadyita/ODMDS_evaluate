        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the financial challenges facing universities in Wales. The main causes of these challenges were identified as the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and uncertainty due to the Augar review and Brexit. The universities in Wales are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England, which has created a funding gap. Despite these challenges, the sector is managing the situation and there is no immediate risk of any institution falling over.\n\nIn terms of university reserves, it was explained that while universities do have reserves, a large portion of these reserves are tied up in their estates and not immediately available as liquid cash. The operating cash generated by universities in 2017-18 was approximately 7.6% of income, compared to nearly 10% for English institutions. The increasing costs of servicing borrowings for investments in estates are also impacting operating cash. However, there have been no reported breaches of loan covenants by universities.\n\nThe meeting also touched on the issue of part-time student funding, which has seen a bigger increase in Wales compared to the rest of the UK. While there is concern about the sustainability of current arrangements, there is a commitment to continue supporting and funding growth in part-time provision.\n\nRegarding research funding, it was acknowledged that QR funding has remained the same for the past nine years. While there have been calls to increase QR funding to maintain its real terms value, the lack of increase is due to limited funding available. The importance of QR funding in supporting the research base and enabling institutions to respond to funding opportunities was emphasized. The impact of underfunding research and the need for increased investment in QR funding were recognized, but no specific assessment of the impact has been conducted by HEFCW.\n\nIn terms of educational research, funding has been allocated to support projects such as WISERD Education, a research collaboration focusing on educational issues. However, no specific allocations for educational research in 2019-20 have been announced yet.\n\nThe potential loss of European Union funds and its impact on future research was also discussed. While the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact, the challenge lies in finding the necessary funding. The government has committed in principle to delivering the recommendations of the Reid review and has allocated additional funding of \u00a36.6 million for research. However, more sustainable funding is needed to address the potential loss of EU funds.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the financial challenges facing universities in Wales and the need for increased funding to support research, innovation, and educational initiatives. The importance of maintaining transparency and openness in reporting income and expenditure was also emphasized.",
        "The discussion on resource implications in the meeting revolved around the potential impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. The main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector were identified as funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and the need for capital expenditure and borrowing to improve facilities and infrastructure. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit was highlighted as a major concern for university management, as it affects relationships with EU partners, access to EU funding, and the overall economic impact on the sector. The decrease in EU and non-EU student applications to Welsh institutions was discussed, with possible factors including changes in student support arrangements, the attractiveness of institutions' facilities, and the perception of safety in Wales. The role of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) in monitoring and advising institutions was outlined, along with the need for institutions to plan for different Brexit scenarios and work towards finding alternative sources of funding. The impact of Brexit on fee and access plans was also discussed, with institutions needing to consider potential changes in student recruitment and fee income. The role of HEFCW in assuring the effective planning of institutions for Brexit was emphasized, along with the need for institutions to engage with students and protect their interests. The potential impact of Brexit on the academic quality of Welsh institutions was discussed, including the potential reduction in the diversity of the student cohort and the need for institutions to manage financial pressures to maintain quality. Overall, the meeting highlighted the challenges and uncertainties faced by Welsh higher education institutions in the context of Brexit, and the need for careful planning and management to ensure the sustainability and quality of the sector.",
        "The discussion on resource implications during the meeting focused on the perspectives of Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish. Julie Morgan expressed concerns about unforeseen costs and the potential impact on the budget. She emphasized the need for transition funding or Brexit transition funding to support the sector during this uncertain time. The Welsh Government has commissioned a report by Professor Graeme Reid, which provides advice and recommendations for supporting research and innovation in the transition period. The report builds on previous recommendations by Professor Diamond and aims to maintain and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure in Wales. \n\nKaren Cornish raised concerns about the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its impact on the sector. She highlighted the challenges faced by institutions in managing the uncertainty and the need for clarity from the government. She also mentioned the issue of funding for higher education sector in Wales, particularly in relation to the implementation of the Diamond recommendations and the reform of tertiary education arrangements. She acknowledged the difficulties faced by the Welsh Government in providing a clear sight of future funding and reiterated the importance of officials' support in this regard. \n\nIn summary, the discussion on resource implications highlighted the need for transition funding, the challenges posed by Brexit, and the importance of clarity and support from the Welsh Government in addressing the funding needs of the higher education sector.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications included the perspectives of Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish. Julie Morgan expressed concerns about unforeseen costs, emphasizing the need for tracking and data systems. Karen Cornish, on the other hand, provided insights on the given budget, highlighting the variable success of the Schools Challenge Cymru program and the need for longer implementation periods to evaluate success.\n\nThe discussion on resource implications revealed that the Schools Challenge Cymru program had variable success, with some schools showing significant improvement while others did not. The evaluation of the program was challenging due to its relatively short duration and the variability in the success of different schools. It was also noted that the success of the program depended on effective collaboration between various stakeholders, such as challenge advisers, local authorities, and regional consortia.\n\nIn terms of the budget, it was acknowledged that financial cuts can create practical challenges for headteachers, leading to staff layoffs and increased workload. However, it was also noted that the effectiveness of an education system is not solely determined by the amount of funding it receives.\n\nThe discussion also touched upon the need for a clearer demarcation of roles and responsibilities between local authorities, regional consortia, and programs like Schools Challenge Cymru. It was recognized that Schools Challenge Cymru aimed to provide additional support and resources to a small number of secondary schools facing particular challenges, while the role of regional consortia was more focused on universal provision.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the importance of evaluating initiatives, sharing good practice, and addressing challenges in specific sectors such as special schools, pupil referral units, and work-based learning. It was also noted that leadership, collaboration, and effective governance play crucial roles in driving improvement in the education system."

The importance of collaboration and sharing best practices between schools, local authorities, and other stakeholders was also emphasized.",
        "During the feedback period on the draft curriculum, the Welsh Government received broad support for the curriculum changes. There was support for the need for change, the principle of a purpose-led curriculum, greater autonomy for the profession, and emphasis on formative assessment. However, there were also some concerns raised, such as the need to simplify and clarify the language used in the curriculum, the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions in religious education, and the role of parents in teaching relationships and sexuality education. \n\nIn response to the feedback, the Welsh Government has decided to include the 'what matters' statements and a statutory framework for progression in the primary legislation. This decision was made to address concerns about national expectations and variation in the curriculum. The 'what matters' statements will provide clarity and certainty about the expectations at a national level, while still allowing flexibility for individual schools. \n\nThe legislation will also address the concerns raised about religious education and relationships and sexuality education. The Welsh Government will consider the feedback received and make a statement on its intentions for these areas in the near future. The aim is to achieve the four purposes of the curriculum and prepare students to be healthy, confident individuals and ethical, informed citizens. \n\nThe final version of the curriculum is expected to be published in January 2020, and the Bill will be introduced following the Easter recess.

        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector were discussed in a meeting with David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, Deputy Chief Executive of HEFCW. The financial challenges facing Welsh universities are a result of several causes. First, there is the impact of a demographic dip in the number of 18-year-olds in Wales, which is deeper and longer than in other parts of the UK. Second, there are increased pension costs and increased costs in general. Third, there is uncertainty due to the Augar review in England and Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales, as many UK universities are also facing financial pressures and taking cost-cutting measures. The Welsh higher education sector has a funding gap compared to the English system, resulting in institutions being approximately \u00a340 million worse off. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which provide additional funding for higher education, is important in addressing the financial challenges. However, taking out costs to balance the books can have a detrimental effect on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. The range of the curriculum, research, and innovation may be diminished as a result. The sector is currently managing the challenges, but if the pressure continues, more costs may be taken out, resulting in job losses and reduced capacity. While there is a possibility of structural change within the sector, such as the closure of departments, there is no immediate risk of institutions falling over. The governing bodies of universities play a crucial role in addressing the challenges and ensuring the interests of students are protected. The institutions are expected to demonstrate appropriate arrangements to ensure students can complete their programs of study. HEFCW also monitors institutions and their financial forecasts to ensure they are managing the challenges effectively. The financial reserves of universities are measured, but it is more important to look at the available liquid cash reserves rather than overall reserves tied up in estates. The operating cash generated by universities is a key measure to assess their financial health. Universities are facing increasing pension costs and the costs of servicing borrowings. The operating cash generated by Welsh universities is lower compared to English institutions, which impacts their ability to meet costs and maintain liquidity. While some universities had substantial reserves in the past, it is important to differentiate between distributable reserves and assets tied up in estates. The governing bodies of universities oversee the estates strategies and financing, ensuring appropriate governance and oversight. There is a need for a consistent minimum set of expectations for governing bodies, and there may be differences in approaches across institutions. The role of the governing body becomes even more significant in challenging circumstances, and there is a need for continual refreshing of governing bodies to bring in diverse perspectives. While there may be tensions between the executive and governing bodies, it is important to have constructive challenge and an open culture within the governance process. HEFCW has a toolkit to support governors in their role and ensure they are properly informed. The risk appetite of governing bodies is assessed",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are as follows: \n\n1. Teacher recruitment and retention problems: The meeting mentioned significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, Finland, and Australia. This is a common issue globally and is also affecting the Welsh higher education sector. The advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner was set up to understand the issues preventing people from pursuing a career in teaching.\n\n2. Lack of diversity in the teaching workforce: There is a need to increase the diversity in the teaching workforce, including attracting career changers with different life and work experience. This will bring a different dynamic to schools and provide valuable experiences for students.\n\n3. Decline in the number of people interested in teaching through the medium of Welsh: Despite the Welsh government's policy to improve the number of Welsh speakers, there has been a decline in the number of people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh. The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in initial teacher education (ITE) is being used to implement recommendations to address this issue.\n\n4. Financial challenges in the higher education sector: The financial challenges facing the higher education sector in Wales are not specified in the given meeting. However, the Welsh government has allocated \u00a320 million to further and higher education in 2019-20, and the allocation between HE and FE will be detailed in the main expenditure group lines of the budget.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Welsh government is taking several actions. They are working to improve teacher recruitment and retention, increase the diversity in the teaching workforce, and promote Welsh-medium provision in ITE. They are also investing in higher apprenticeships and working with regional skills partnerships to improve outcomes for learners. Additionally, efforts are being made to address mental health issues among students and ensure the well-being of learners. The government is also reviewing the role of the regional skills partnerships and the governance of the sector. The pay dispute in the FE sector is also being addressed, with efforts to resolve the stalemate and ensure a reasonable settlement for staff.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector include the negotiation of pay settlements, the funding responsibilities of FE colleges, and the potential impact of upcoming changes to pensions.

        "During the meeting, Dr. David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, discussed the impact of Brexit on the higher education system in Wales. He mentioned that uncertainty about the relationship with Europe is a significant concern for university management, as universities in Wales make an annual economic impact of \u00a35 billion and employ 50,000 people. The uncertainty surrounding EU students, EU research funding, and structural funds from the EU is already having an impact on applications from EU students to Welsh institutions, with a decrease of 8% in EU student applications compared to a 2% increase for English institutions. The decrease in applications from non-EU international students is also a concern, with a 9% decrease for Welsh institutions compared to a 7% increase for English institutions.\n\nDr. Blaney also highlighted the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector, including funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and uncertainty about the Augar review of fees and funding in England. He emphasized the need for increased investment in capital infrastructure to attract students and improve the student experience, and the importance of the Diamond recommendations for re-establishing funding in higher education.\n\nIn terms of the impact on research funding, Dr. Blaney mentioned the need for increased investment in research to support the quality and productivity of the research base in Wales. He also highlighted the importance of maintaining collaborations and networks with European partners, and the potential impact of Brexit on access to EU research funding.\n\nDr. Blaney discussed the role of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales in assuring the quality of higher education institutions and the need for institutions to be properly sighted on the risks and challenges posed by Brexit.

        "The discussion about the issues with HMRC in the meeting focused on the constraints faced by officials in providing information to Welsh universities. The officials have been helpful in providing planning assumptions and indications, but they cannot pre-empt the budget process.

        "The Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. She explained that the initial draft of the Bill was tabled to ensure that there would be an opportunity for the Assembly to introduce any amendments under section 1 when it comes into effect. She acknowledged that statutory instrument is the process for introducing changes, but there is still flexibility in terms of whether it should be introduced by a negative or affirmative procedure. The Deputy Minister also mentioned that Amendment 3A is a holding position and will be discussed further in Stage 3.

The Deputy Minister also mentioned that work is being done to update the regulatory impact assessment and that a revised version will be shared with the committee. She argued against the amendments proposed by Suzy Davies and Janet Finch-Saunders, stating that they would give power to non-devolved bodies and create uncertainty in the timing of the Bill's commencement.

        "The Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. She emphasized that the Bill is not about child abuse, but rather about protecting children's rights and ensuring that they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. The Deputy Minister acknowledged that people have different views on this issue, but stressed that any form of physical punishment, no matter how mild, is incompatible with children's human rights. She also highlighted the importance of clarity in the law and the need to send a consistent message to children that physical punishment is not acceptable. The Deputy Minister acknowledged that bringing up children is difficult, but emphasized that there are alternative methods of discipline that can be used. She stated that the Bill is not about taking away tools from parents, but rather about promoting positive and non-violent ways of disciplining children. The Deputy Minister also addressed concerns about the impact of the Bill on social services and the threshold for intervention. She stated that the Bill does not change the threshold for intervention and that social services already receive and investigate reports of physical punishment. She emphasized that the focus of the Bill is on prevention and creating a culture where physical punishment is not acceptable. The Deputy Minister also addressed concerns about the implementation of the Bill and the need for consistent multi-agency safeguarding hubs. She stated that the effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on multi-agency safeguarding hubs, as there are already well-established mechanisms in place for joint working between social services and the police. However, she acknowledged that the development of multi-agency safeguarding hubs could be beneficial in improving coordination and communication between agencies.
