    "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the financial challenges facing universities in Wales. The main causes of these challenges were identified as the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and uncertainty due to the Augar review and Brexit. The universities in Wales are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England, which has created a funding gap. Despite these challenges, the sector is managing the situation and there is no immediate risk of any institution falling over. In terms of university reserves, a large portion of these reserves are tied up in their estates and not immediately available as liquid cash. The operating cash generated by universities in 2017-18 was approximately 7.6% of income, compared to nearly 10% for English institutions. The increasing costs of servicing borrowings for investments in estates are also impacting operating cash. However, there have been no reported breaches of loan covenants by universities. The meeting also touched on the issue of part-time student funding, with a bigger increase in Wales compared to the rest of the UK. While there is concern about the sustainability of current arrangements, there is a commitment to continue supporting and funding growth in part-time provision. Regarding research funding, QR funding has remained the same for the past nine years. The importance of QR funding in supporting the research base and enabling institutions to respond to funding opportunities was emphasized. The potential loss of European Union funds and its impact on future research was also discussed. The government has committed in principle to delivering the recommendations of the Reid review and has allocated additional funding of \u00a36.6 million for research. However, more sustainable funding is needed to address the potential loss of EU funds. The meeting highlighted the financial challenges facing universities in Wales and the need for increased funding to support research, innovation, and educational initiatives. The discussion on resource implications in the meeting revolved around the potential impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. The main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector were identified as funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and the need for capital expenditure and borrowing to improve facilities and infrastructure. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit was highlighted as a major concern for university management, as it affects relationships with EU partners, access to EU funding, and the overall economic impact on the sector. The decrease in EU and non-EU student applications to Welsh institutions was discussed, with possible factors including changes in student support arrangements, the attractiveness of institutions' facilities, and the perception of safety in Wales. The role of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) in monitoring and advising institutions was outlined, along with the need for institutions to plan for different Brexit scenarios and work towards finding alternative sources of funding. The impact of Brexit on fee and access plans was also discussed, with institutions needing to consider potential changes in student recruitment and fee income. The potential impact of Brexit on the academic quality of Welsh institutions was discussed, including the potential reduction in the diversity of the student cohort and the need",
    "During the meeting, Kirsty Williams AM discussed the importance of regulation and accountability in institutions for their public funding and privileges. She mentioned the need for a regulatory regime that encourages collaboration and cooperation in the sector.

    "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are as follows:\n\n1. Demographic dip: The number of 18-year-olds in Wales is declining more significantly and for a longer period than in other parts of the UK. This decrease in student population affects the revenue and funding for Welsh universities.\n\n2. Increased costs: Welsh universities are facing increased pension costs and other general costs. These rising expenses put additional financial pressure on the sector.\n\n3. Uncertainty: The Augar review in England and Brexit create uncertainty in the higher education sector, which can impact funding and financial stability.\n\n4. Funding gap: The Welsh higher education sector has a funding gap compared to the English system, resulting in institutions being approximately \u00a340 million worse off. This lack of funding contributes to the financial challenges faced by Welsh universities.\n\n5. Cost-cutting measures: In response to financial pressures, Welsh universities are taking cost-cutting measures. However, these measures can have a negative impact on the ability of the system to deliver a broad curriculum, conduct research, and foster innovation.\n\n6. Job losses and reduced capacity: If the financial pressure continues, more costs may need to be cut, leading to job losses and reduced capacity within the higher education sector.\n\n7. Structural changes: While there is no immediate risk of institutions falling over, there may be a possibility of structural changes within the sector, such as the closure of departments, to address financial challenges.\n\n8. Governance role: The governing bodies of universities play a crucial role in addressing the financial challenges and protecting the interests of students. They oversee financial forecasts, monitor institutions, and ensure appropriate arrangements are in place for students to complete their programs of study.\n\n9. Need for consistent expectations: There is a need for a consistent minimum set of expectations for governing bodies to address financial challenges effectively. Differences in approaches across institutions may exist, highlighting the importance of refreshing governing bodies to bring diverse perspectives.\n\n10. Operating cash and reserves: The operating cash generated by Welsh universities is lower compared to English institutions, impacting their ability to meet costs and maintain liquidity. It is essential to differentiate between distributable reserves and assets tied up in estates when assessing financial reserves.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Welsh government is taking actions such as improving teacher recruitment and retention, increasing diversity in the teaching workforce, promoting Welsh-medium provision in initial teacher education, and investing in higher apprenticeships. They are also addressing mental health issues among students and reviewing the role of regional skills partnerships and governance in the sector. Pay disputes in the FE sector are being addressed, and efforts are made to combat academic misconduct through a UK approach. Overall, proactive measures are needed to address the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector.",
    "During the meeting, Dr. David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, discussed the impact of Brexit on the higher education system in Wales. He mentioned that uncertainty about the relationship with Europe is a significant concern for university management, as universities in Wales make an annual economic impact of \u00a35 billion and employ 50,000 people. The uncertainty surrounding EU students, EU research funding, and structural funds from the EU is already having an impact on applications from EU students to Welsh institutions, with a decrease of 8% in EU student applications compared to a 2% increase for English institutions. The decrease in applications from non-EU international students is also a concern, with a 9% decrease for Welsh institutions compared to a 7% increase for English institutions.\n\nDr. Blaney also highlighted the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector, including funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and uncertainty about the Augar review of fees and funding in England. He emphasized the need for increased investment in capital infrastructure to attract students and improve the student experience, and the importance of the Diamond recommendations for re-establishing funding in higher education.\n\nIn terms of the impact on research funding, Dr. Blaney mentioned the need for increased investment in research to support the quality and productivity of the research base in Wales. He also highlighted the importance of maintaining collaborations and networks with European partners, and the potential impact of Brexit on access to EU research funding.\n\nDr. Blaney discussed the role of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales in assuring the quality of higher education institutions and the need for institutions to be properly sighted on the risks and challenges posed by Brexit.

    "During the meeting, there was a discussion about the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them, including Julie Morgan's perspective. Julie Morgan, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, explained that her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law regarding the defence of reasonable punishment. These amendments were in response to a recommendation from the committee in the Stage 1 report. She also committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over a period of six years from Royal Assent, should the Bill be passed. The committee members had the opportunity to speak and raise their concerns or questions. Overall, the decision was made to reject some of the proposed amendments and to proceed with Julie Morgan's amendments 1 and 4.\n\nThe Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) provided evidence suggesting that Brexit has had an impact on Welsh higher education. Some of the specific issues mentioned include the decrease in applications from EU students, the challenges in participating in EU collaborative research activities, and the potential financial implications of Brexit. The HEFCW also highlighted the pressures faced by the higher education sector, such as funding constraints, changes in student recruitment, and the need for investment in facilities and infrastructure. However, the exact impact of Brexit and future funding arrangements for higher education in Wales are difficult to predict.\n\nThe discussion about the issues with HMRC in the meeting focused on the constraints faced by officials in providing information to Welsh universities. Julie Morgan's perspective was not mentioned in the meeting.\n\nDuring the meeting, several issues were discussed regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh bac) qualification and its delivery in schools. One concern raised was the lack of consistency in the way the qualification is taught and assessed. The need for more guidance and support for teachers was emphasized, as well as the importance of professional learning and teacher training to ensure a high-quality delivery of the qualification.\n\nThe suggestion of changing the name of the Welsh bac qualification was also discussed. The decision was made to maintain the current brand name to avoid confusion and potential setbacks in developing a better understanding of the qualification.\n\nConcerns about the rigour of the Welsh bac qualification were addressed. While some stakeholders raised doubts about its rigour and suggested that it is passively marked and grades are inflated, the Minister of Education emphasized that the qualification has been benchmarked against A-levels and is recognized by universities as an equivalent qualification. The value of the individual project work in developing skills was highlighted.\n\nThere were differing opinions about the perception of the Welsh bac qualification by universities. While some stakeholders expressed concerns about universities not valuing the qualification or considering it as equivalent to A-levels, the Minister of Education emphasized that all Welsh universities accept the Welsh bac as an A-level equivalent and use it for admission purposes. Conversations with universities, including Russell Group universities, expressed a high regard for the Welsh bac and its value in developing skills necessary for successful transition to university",
    "The WISERD research has found that students from disadvantaged backgrounds face challenges that affect their educational outcomes, such as lower levels of academic achievement, educational attainment, and aspirations. They are also more likely to be placed in lower-achieving schools and have less access to resources and support. This leads to lower levels of social mobility and economic opportunities, higher barriers to accessing higher education, and higher levels of unemployment and poverty.\n\nTo address these concerns, the Welsh Government has implemented measures such as the national mission for education in Wales, the Pupil Development Grant, and the Schools Challenge Cymru program. However, there is a need for targeted interventions and support, improved access to resources and opportunities, and a greater focus on social mobility and equality in the education system.\n\nIn a meeting, the Minister emphasized the importance of building confidence in the sector and following through on commitments to improve the system. They discussed the need for a new approach to identifying and supporting schools causing concern, as well as the challenges of measuring performance and the role of regional consortia. The Minister acknowledged the persistent attainment gap between students from different socio-economic backgrounds and the need for continued efforts to close this gap.\n\nThe meeting recognized the \u00a3475 million investment in the pupil development grant but also acknowledged that the problem of the attainment gap persists. Focus on early intervention was emphasized, as well as the need for targeted support for different groups within the minority ethnic category and for looked-after children. Overall, the meeting recognized progress but highlighted the need for continued focus and improvement in supporting students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system.",
    "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. She explained that her amendments would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. She also discussed other amendments in the group and explained why she did not support them.\n\nThe Deputy Minister also addressed the regulation-making powers in the Bill. She mentioned that the initial draft of the Bill was tabled to ensure that there would be an opportunity for the Assembly to introduce any amendments under section 1 when it comes into effect. She acknowledged that statutory instrument is the process for introducing changes, but there is still flexibility in terms of whether it should be introduced by a negative or affirmative procedure. She emphasized the importance of discussing the kind of powers that are needed for the legislation.\n\nThe Deputy Minister emphasized her commitment to raising awareness about the changes in the law and ensuring the effectiveness of the legislation. She argued against amendments proposed by other members, stating that they would give power to non-devolved bodies and create uncertainty in the timing of the Bill's commencement. She also mentioned that work is being done to update the regulatory impact assessment and that a revised version will be shared with the committee.\n\nThe Deputy Minister highlighted that the Bill is not about child abuse, but rather about protecting children's rights and ensuring that they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. She acknowledged that people have different views on this issue, but stressed that any form of physical punishment, no matter how mild, is incompatible with children's human rights. She also addressed concerns about the impact of the Bill on social services and the threshold for intervention, stating that the Bill does not change the threshold for intervention and that social services already receive and investigate reports of physical punishment. She emphasized that the focus of the Bill is on prevention and creating a culture where physical punishment is not acceptable.\n\nThe Deputy Minister expressed confidence in the legislation and the ongoing efforts to ensure its effective implementation. She discussed how the government has committed funding for an awareness-raising campaign and is working with various organizations to collect data and monitor the impact of the legislation. She acknowledged that there may be unknown costs and challenges, but expressed confidence in the government's preparations and the support of relevant organizations. She also addressed concerns about public awareness and the potential for polarization, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive awareness campaign and maintaining a consensual approach."
