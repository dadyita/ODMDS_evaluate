The professor expressed concern because this latency would need to be reduced significantly in order to meet the desired system requirements. The allowable latency was stated to be 250 milliseconds, but there was some discussion about potentially changing this rule. The professor explained that the people who wanted lower latency were the ones with shorter latency requirements, while those with longer latency didn't mind the current duration. \n\nThe discussion then shifted to the topic of handling latency in the system. The professor mentioned that the current system did not explicitly handle additive noise and relied on training the system to be more discriminant. However, other methods like spectral subtraction schemes were found to handle noise better. The team considered implementing some of these methods to improve the system's performance. \n\nIn response to the question about the professor's issue with latency, it was explained that the latency was a concern because it would affect the real-time nature of the system. The professor emphasized that a quarter-second delay for processing should not be a big issue when communicating with a remote server for recognition. The team also discussed their past experiences with latency in similar systems and mentioned that users did not notice a significant difference between a quarter of a second and 30 milliseconds of latency. \n\nMoving on to another topic, the discussion shifted to a proposal for the upcoming quals. One member of the team explained their plan to extend the work done by Larry Saul, John Allen, and Mazin Rahim. They described a multi-band system that used sub-band features and trained detectors to detect phonetic features. The detectors were implemented using logistic regressions, and the system utilized soft AND and OR gates for combining the detectors at different levels. The team discussed the advantages of this approach, including its ability to use narrow-band information for phonetic features and the explicit training of detectors for a product of errors rule. \n\nThe team also discussed the possibility of marking other low-level features using this approach, such as frication, abrupt closure, R-coloring, nasality, and voicing. They mentioned that John Ohala would potentially help with transcribing the meeting data to mark these features. \n\nLastly, there was a brief discussion about de-reverberation algorithms for far-mic speech recognition. The team mentioned comparing the performance of robust approaches like MSG with speech enhancement or de-reverberation approaches. One approach mentioned was de-convolution by filtering with a longer time window, while other approaches were still being explored for speech enhancement.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion on latency in the system was briefly mentioned. The professor mentioned that the current system has a latency of 220 milliseconds, which includes the cleaning of the speech, neural network processing, and delta computation. The professor also mentioned that the latency could be reduced by moving the delta computation before the on-line normalization and potentially reducing the number of features. However, the professor also stated that they are waiting for a decision from the committee regarding the latency requirements.\n\nThe duration of the latency was discussed, and it was determined that the current latency of 220 milliseconds is too large. The professor mentioned that they need to decrease the latency to meet the requirements, which might involve reconfiguring the system and experimenting with different feature sets. The professor also mentioned that the tandem neural network approach was being tested, but it was found that it performed worse on highly mismatched conditions compared to the previous VAD system.\n\nOverall, the professor and the team are aware of the latency issue and are actively working to improve it by adjusting the system configuration and exploring different feature sets. They are also considering the impact of the tandem neural network approach on the overall performance of the system.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion on latency in the system was brought up. The professor had an issue with the latency because it was affecting the performance of the system. The duration of the latency was discussed, with the main sources being the noise compensation process, the input to the neural net, and the output smoothing. \n\nThe professor mentioned that there was a limit of sixty features chosen for the system, which some people wanted to increase. The issue with the latency was that it was causing more deletions in the highly mismatched condition, which affected the overall performance. The professor suggested exploring different features and correlations between them to improve the training set. \n\nThe team also discussed the possibility of using LDA on the features before training the models, as it had been successful in other systems. However, it was decided that it might not be a good idea due to the differences in noise conditions between the training and testing sets. \n\nAnother suggestion was to feed the VAD (Voice Activity Detection) information into the neural net to provide additional discriminating information. It was also mentioned that the VAD output could be used to modify the output probabilities of the neural net. \n\nThe team discussed the possibility of using context-dependent units instead of phonemes for the tandem net. It was suggested to use generalized diphones and reduce them with KLT. \n\nThe professor mentioned that he would be leaving for a few weeks, so there would be a break in the meetings. The team was encouraged to continue meeting without him and to continue working on the system. The evaluation was tentatively set for November, but the exact date was not confirmed."

        "During the meeting, the topic of discussion was the location of the recording equipment. The decision made was to reduce the latency problem by decreasing it to 220 milliseconds, which is 80 milliseconds less than before. Currently, the system has a latency of 230 milliseconds. It was determined that the primary factor affecting the latency is the voice activity detection (VAD) system. It was suggested to make the VAD shorter to further reduce the latency. \n\nOther options discussed included improving the VAD system and working on the second stream of the system. It was mentioned that the tandem network could be improved by using a hierarchical structure and incorporating the silence probability from the VAD network. It was also suggested to train the tandem network on more data and to explore different noise estimation techniques. \n\nAdditionally, the meeting touched upon the performance of the system compared to human performance. It was mentioned that the system achieved a digit error rate of around 7%, while a human listener achieved a digit error rate of approximately 1%. It was suggested to investigate the impact of pitch information on the system's performance. \n\nIn regards to the Wall Street Journal task, it was mentioned that the Mississippi State system achieved an 8.2% word error rate using a bigram grammar. The scripts for running the system on the Wall Street Journal data were downloaded, but there were some technical issues with running it on a single CPU. It was also discussed that some sites may not have the compute power to run the Wall Street Journal task, and there was a possibility of Mississippi State running the system for them. The need for tuning parameters, such as word insertion penalties, was also mentioned. \n\nOverall, the meeting provided an overview of the options discussed and the decision made regarding the location of the recording equipment, as well as other related topics.",
        "In the meeting, the options discussed regarding the location of the recording equipment were to have more regular meetings of known types and to have data from different domains or types of meetings. The decision made was to have more regular meetings and to aim for a variety of meeting types. It was also mentioned that advertising to linguistics graduate students may help in getting more native speakers for the recordings. Additionally, there was a discussion about the need for both regular meetings and random scattered meetings to gather data for different research purposes. It was suggested that having multiple speakers and different meeting types would be beneficial for acoustic-oriented research. Overall, the decision was to have a mix of regular and random scattered meetings to gather a diverse set of data.",
        "During the meeting, the options discussed regarding the location of the recording equipment were as follows:\n\n1. Using a room in the linguistics department or another building on campus: It was suggested that if Mari from IBM doesn't use the equipment, it could be set up in a room in the linguistics department or another building. This would require finding a motivated partner on campus who is interested in the project.\n\n2. Turning the equipment into a portable setup: Professor D mentioned the idea of making the recording equipment portable so that it can be easily moved around. This would involve wheeling the equipment to different locations.\n\n3. Recording meetings at ICSI: It was suggested that the meetings could continue to be recorded at ICSI, as they are currently doing. The room where the recordings take place is underused and can accommodate the equipment.\n\nThe decision regarding the location of the recording equipment was not explicitly stated in the meeting. However, there was a consensus among the participants that the first priority should be to try to get people to come to ICSI for the meetings. The room at ICSI is already set up for recording and it would be convenient to have the meetings in one location.\n\nAdditionally, it was mentioned that more disk space is needed for recording future meetings. It was discussed that the current disk space can accommodate about four more meetings, and they are planning to move some data from other disks to free up space.\n\nRegarding the progress on the project, PhD C shared their work on identifying and marking overlapping zones in the meeting recordings. They mentioned their plan to use a supervised clustering process to classify the different zones and evaluate the performance of different parameters. They also mentioned the possibility of using a neural network for classification, but expressed concerns about the lack of transparency in understanding the inner workings of the network.\n\nOverall, the options discussed and the decision made regarding the location of the recording equipment were to prioritize recording meetings at ICSI and to explore the possibility of setting up the equipment in a room in the linguistics department or another building on campus if it becomes available.",
        "During the meeting, several options and decisions were discussed regarding the location of the recording equipment. The team considered using a neural net, analyzing the effects of different inputs, and using a decision tree. However, it was determined that these methods would not be suitable for the specific variables being analyzed, such as pitch and cepstral coefficients. Instead, it was suggested to start by visualizing the data in two dimensions, using scatter plots of selected features. This would provide insight into how the different classes are separated. It was also recommended to consider the temporal properties and potentially build a Markov model or use features based on larger chunks of time. \n\nIn terms of the location of the recording equipment, the team discussed the possibility of using a PDA with multiple microphones for better beamforming. However, it was noted that the position of the speakers and the limitations of the PDA could affect the accuracy of the beamforming. It was also mentioned that having multiple PDAs communicating with each other could provide additional information for speaker separation. \n\nRegarding the decision to anonymize the data, it was suggested to use the same anonymized name for both the speaker identifier and in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned. The team acknowledged the need for anonymity to protect the identity of the speakers but also recognized the potential challenges in maintaining consistency and clarity in the transcript. It was agreed that further discussion and consideration were necessary to determine the best approach for anonymization.",
        "During the meeting, several options and decisions were discussed regarding the location of the recording equipment. It was mentioned that the current setup with wired microphones has had some issues, such as spikes in the audio. It was suggested to replace the wired microphones with wireless ones, potentially adding more wireless channels to accommodate more participants. The status of the recordings and transcriptions was also discussed, with approximately 35 hours of non-digit recordings and 11 hours of transcriptions completed so far. The transcriptions are being checked for accuracy and consistency, including the incorporation of additional conventions for numbers, acronyms, and vocalized/non-vocalized sounds. It was mentioned that a filter could be used to efficiently handle these conventions. The next steps include tightening up the time boundaries and using channel-based speech-nonspeech segmentation. The overall goal is to have clean and channelized data for further analysis by Liz and Don.",
        "During the meeting, several options and decisions were discussed regarding the location of the recording equipment. The meeting participants talked about the differences between the transcribers and their abilities to accurately transcribe technical jargon and colloquial speech. They also discussed the possibility of editing the transcripts to remove sections that participants did not want included in the data set. The issue of privacy and how to distribute passwords for accessing the transcripts was also raised. The participants debated whether email approval was sufficient or if a concrete signature was necessary. They also considered the convenience of accessing the transcripts on a web page versus receiving a printed copy. Ultimately, they decided to contact participants via email to ask if they wanted to review the transcripts and provide a password for web access if needed. The participants acknowledged the importance of maintaining the integrity of the data while also recognizing the potential burden on participants to review the transcripts."
