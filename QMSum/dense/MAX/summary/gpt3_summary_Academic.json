    "SmartKom is an architecture and module system that is part of the German SmartKom project. It allows users to speak into the system and receive responses. The system uses a German synthesis module for English sentences, although there are still some issues with certain words and phrases. The system also includes a dialogue manager, a knowledge base, and a generation module. The architecture is designed to be language independent, with the ability to generate syntactic structures for different languages. The system currently has syntax trees for a few sentences, but more work needs to be done to expand the trees for different utterances. The importance of SmartKom lies in its potential to improve communication and interaction between humans and computers. It also has the potential to be integrated into other projects and research areas, such as spatial descriptions and reference frames.\n\nSmartKom is a project that involves collecting dialogues for the purpose of training and developing the SmartKom system.

    "The current status of the segmenter is that it is working well and there have been discussions about potential improvements and changes. The team has discussed the possibility of re-evaluating the recognition results using the segmenter and using it to train the speech detector. There has also been discussion about adding SmartKom data to the Meeting Recorder corpus, with the decision to keep it separate but use the same infrastructure. The issue of disk space and backup capacity was mentioned, with the suggestion to use tape for archiving and have a separate file server for heavily accessed data. Consent issues and transcription were raised, with transcription being done in Munich. The idea of archiving data on CD-ROM or DVD was brought up, but tape was deemed a more reliable option. \n\nThe team also discussed recent changes and improvements to the segmenter. There were discussions about the backup system and the need for faster nightly backups. The possibility of using high-density tape drives and storing data on non-backed-up disks was suggested. The team also discussed the difference in error rates between males and females in recognition experiments and the need for further testing with a larger training set. The transcription effort was praised for its positive results, with the suggestion to use transcribers for a more detailed analysis of overlaps in recordings. The issue of microphone placement and its effect on recording quality was also mentioned. \n\nIn terms of recent changes, it was mentioned that Dave Gelbart volunteered to modify the Transcriber tool to improve the segmenter's performance. The team discussed the use of amplitude and energy levels to separate different speakers and improve accuracy. The team also mentioned the progress made on the TI-digits dataset and the potential for future research on modeling articulatory features. They discussed the challenges of annotating and marking gestural features and the need for intermediate levels of representation. There was also discussion about the potential for higher-order organization within meetings and the need for further analysis to improve the segmenter's performance. \n\nThe team also discussed the use of Javier's system, which focuses on silences, and the possibility of using a new class to divide speech into overlapping and non-overlapping segments. They discussed the potential use of the BIC criterion and Gaussian training to distinguish between overlapping and speech zones. The team mentioned the progress made on the TI-digits dataset and the need to extract the actual digits and enter relevant information into the computer.

    "During the team's discussion on support vector machines, controlling the size of combinatorial input, and volume variation, several points were brought up. The team discussed the transcription effort and the use of microphones, mentioning that the current transcription system uses an HMM-based system with Gaussian mixtures for speech and nonspeech. Improvements have been made in the nonspeech-speech pre-segmenting of the signal. They also discussed the need for a tool that can accurately represent overlaps in the transcriptions, such as a musical score notation. The team mentioned a tool developed by Susanne Burger at CMU that can handle eight channels simultaneously, but it runs on Windows. They also considered using the Praat software for transcription, which is multi-platform.\n\nThe team discussed the possibility of treating breath and laughter as special words with dedicated phones in the recognition system. They also discussed the importance of microphone placement and wearing the microphone correctly to reduce breathing noise. Suggestions were made to have people move the microphone slightly away from the center of their mouth and to wear it close enough to get good volume.\n\nIn terms of experiments and findings, the team conducted experiments using different features and neural networks trained on various datasets. They found that using delta in the features improved performance compared to not using delta. Training on TIMIT for English produced better results compared to training on other languages. They also performed cross-language experiments, finding that training on English only yielded better results compared to training on French or Spanish.\n\nThe team explored feature combination experiments and found that combining features and neural network outputs improved performance.
