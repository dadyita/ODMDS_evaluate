    "The meeting discussed the conceptual design of a remote control and aimed to reach a decision on the concept. The market research showed that a fancy look and feel, along with technological innovativeness, were top priorities for users. Ease of use was also important, but not as much as the other factors. Fashion trends indicated that a fruit and vegetable motif would be popular. \n\nBased on these findings, it was decided that the remote control should have a fancy look and feel, incorporate lots of technology, and be easy to use. The project manager preferred a design with frequently used buttons placed in the middle and made larger in size. Less frequently used buttons could be covered. The industrial designer suggested a sliding or rolling feature for easier manipulation. The use of speech recognition technology was also discussed, with consideration for energy consumption.\n\nThe engineering requirements included a main board size of at least seven centimeters and a seven-inch TFT screen. The possibility of using solar cells for additional energy supply and a spongy design were also mentioned.\n\nThe user interface designer emphasized the need for a user-friendly interface with larger buttons in the middle. The idea of a removable spongy cover for the buttons and a light adaptation system based on the content being watched were also mentioned.\n\nThe marketing representative stressed the importance of a fancy look and feel, as well as considering the fruit and vegetable fashion trends. The idea of a fruit-shaped remote control, such as a banana or pear, was discussed.\n\nOverall, the decisions made in the meeting include the preference for a fancy and technologically innovative design, the consideration of a fruit-shaped remote control, the importance of ease of use, and the exploration of incorporating speech recognition technology. Further discussions and collaboration between the industrial designer and the user interface designer will be needed to work on a prototype based on the agreed-upon design.",
    "Based on the team's evaluation of the entire production process, they expressed several likes and dislikes. They liked the room for creativity during the design process, the opportunity to work individually and then come together in meetings to discuss progress, and the effectiveness of using a whiteboard and PowerPoint for presenting ideas. They also found the study conducted with test subjects helpful in understanding user preferences, discovering that users generally disliked the look and feel of most remote controls on the market, preferred remote controls with LED lights to indicate button presses, and liked lightweight remote controls with a pleasant sound when buttons were pressed.\n\nHowever, the team also faced some difficulties. They mentioned time pressure and the need to cut down on certain features due to budget constraints. They would have liked more information about the costs of different components at the beginning of the project. Despite these challenges, they felt that the process went smoothly overall and were satisfied with the outcome.\n\nIn terms of likes, the team appreciated incorporating high technology features into the remote control design, such as LCD display and speech recognition, as well as having a simpler and more user-friendly design with fewer buttons. They also liked the idea of a remote control that could control multiple devices connected to the TV and having a trendy and fashionable design.\n\nHowever, they had concerns about the cost of production, feasibility of certain design elements like a two-sided or sliding mechanism remote control, the complexity and usability of too many functions or buttons, and the issue of losing the remote control.\n\nIn conclusion, the team had a positive overall evaluation of the production process, with a focus on incorporating new technology, simplifying the design, and creating a fashionable look. They faced challenges related to cost, complexity, and usability but ultimately felt that they had created a remote control that was both fashionable and technologically innovative.",
