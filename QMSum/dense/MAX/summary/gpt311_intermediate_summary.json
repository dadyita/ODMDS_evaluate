        "In this meeting, the focus was on the conceptual design of a remote control. The goal was to reach a decision on the concept by the end of the meeting. The project manager presented recent results from market research and fashion trends. The market research indicated that a fancy look and feel, as opposed to a functional look and feel, was the number one priority. The ease of use was also important, but less so than the technological innovativeness of the remote control. The fashion trends from Paris and Milan revealed that the fruit and vegetable motif would be popular in clothes, shoes, and furniture.\n\nBased on these findings, the remote control should have a fancy look and feel, with lots of technology incorporated. It should also be easy to use. The project manager expressed a preference for a design that is easy to use, with frequently used buttons placed in the middle of the remote control and made larger in size. The remote control should not require users to learn how to use it, and buttons that are not frequently used can be covered. The industrial designer suggested incorporating a sliding or rolling feature inside the remote control for easier manipulation. The use of speech recognition technology was also discussed, with considerations for energy consumption.\n\nThe industrial designer presented the overall engineering requirements, including the size of the main board, the TFT screen, and the infrared unit. The size of the board should be at least seven centimeters, with the screen being seven inches. The industrial designer also mentioned the possibility of using solar cells for additional energy supply, as well as the potential for a spongy design.\n\nThe user interface designer discussed the need for a user-friendly interface, with larger buttons in the middle for easy access. The designer also suggested the possibility of a removable spongy cover for the buttons, similar to peeling a banana, to enhance the user experience. The idea of incorporating a light adaptation system based on the content being watched was also mentioned.\n\nThe marketing representative highlighted the importance of having a fancy look and feel, as well as considering the fashion trends of fruits and vegetables. The idea of a remote control shaped like a fruit, such as a banana or pear, was discussed.\n\nOverall, the decisions made in this meeting include the preference for a fancy and technologically innovative design, the consideration of a fruit-shaped remote control, the importance of ease of use, and the exploration of incorporating speech recognition technology. The next steps involve further discussions and collaboration between the industrial designer and the user interface designer to work on a prototype based on the agreed-upon design.",
