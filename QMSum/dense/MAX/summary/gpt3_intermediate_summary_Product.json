        "The Industrial Designer disagreed with Marketing and User Interface on various design aspects of the product. The main points of disagreement were regarding the use of technology on the remote control, the size of the remote control, and the functionality of the options menu.\n\nThe Industrial Designer believed that including too much technology on the remote control would make it costly. They also expressed concern about the size of the remote control, particularly if a speech recognition system was added. They suggested that the TV itself could have the speech recognition system instead.\n\nThe User Interface team disagreed with the Industrial Designer, stating that technology such as speech recognition already exists and can be easily implemented. They also argued that the remote control could be made slim and still have the necessary functionality.\n\nThe Marketing team expressed concern about the size of the remote control and whether it would be appealing to customers. They suggested that the speech recognition system could be optional and that the remote control should be easy to hold and use.\n\nOverall, the Industrial Designer disagreed with Marketing and User Interface on the design aspects of the remote control, particularly regarding the use of technology and the size of the remote control.

        "During the meeting, the Industrial Designer disagreed with Marketing and User Interface on various design aspects of the product. The Industrial Designer felt that it was important to find out the meaning of icons on buttons, while Marketing and User Interface believed that it would be difficult for users to learn how to use the product if icons were used. Additionally, the Industrial Designer wanted to include a scroll wheel and push button, but Marketing and User Interface felt that it would be better to have a normal scroll wheel and eliminate the push button. There was also disagreement on the use of a sample speaker, with Marketing suggesting to remove it to lower the production cost, while the Industrial Designer wanted to keep it as a special feature. \n\nOverall, the Industrial Designer felt that there was a lack of communication and collaboration between team members, and that more time and information could have improved the quality of work. The team agreed that the SMARTboard was not always effective and that a digital pen could be a better alternative. They also suggested having more time for individual work phases and better communication during the process. Despite the disagreements, the team was satisfied with the results and celebrated the completion of the project."
