        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications included Julie Morgan's perspective on unforeseen costs and Karen Cornish's perspective on the given budget. The funding position was highlighted as the main pressure on the Welsh higher education sector. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance were in the process of being implemented, and changes to the student finance arrangements were set to take effect from September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions were expected to take longer. The other pressures mentioned were student recruitment, pay and pension costs, increased student expectations for modern facilities, and uncertainty about potential consequences from the review in England of fees and funding. In terms of resource implications, it was noted that the funding allocations for 2018-19 had been announced, but funding for research and teaching was still at a lower level than recommended by the Diamond report. It was expected that funding would be introduced from 2019-20 to start implementing the Diamond recommendations.",

        "The panel of experts expressed the opinion that employers do not have a clear understanding of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification and its value. They argued that the title of the qualification, \"Welsh bac,\" is not helpful and suggested that a better title would be the \"Skills Challenge Certificate.\" The panel also noted that many employers are more focused on the specific qualifications and skills required for their industry rather than the Welsh baccalaureate. They highlighted the need for more employer engagement and input in the development of the qualification to ensure that it aligns with the skills and employability needs of industries. The panel also discussed the challenges of funding and prioritization within the education system, with a focus on GCSE resits taking precedence over the Welsh baccalaureate at lower levels.

        "The Welsh Government has been working closely with higher education (HE) and further education (FE) institutions to assess the potential impact of Brexit. The government has formed a working group with representatives from HE and FE to gather information and help shape its response. Each institution is analyzing its own exposure to EU students, funding, and projects such as Horizon 2020. The government has also been engaging with the National Union of Students to understand the concerns and priorities of students. In terms of preparedness for a no-deal Brexit, the government has been visiting institutions to ensure they have plans in place and is working with officials in Westminster to address specific issues such as Erasmus+ provision and Horizon 2020 funding. The government has also set up a European Transition Team to coordinate its response to Brexit. In terms of student recruitment, the government acknowledges that there has been a drop in EU student applications in Wales due to changes in government policy regarding student support. However, the full picture will not be known until the spring when the final census data is available.",

Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM expressed different opinions on this matter. Sian Gwenllian AM inquired about quality assurance and Kirsty Williams AM responded by explaining that they are developing a new performance measure for schools that will focus on school performance for all children. Kirsty Williams AM also emphasized the need for a more sophisticated model that looks at each individual child, tracks their progress, and measures the value added by the school in terms of performance. Kirsty Williams AM further stated that the current performance measure, level 2 plus, narrows the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort and does not adequately measure the progress and value added by the school. The meeting also discussed the confidence in the data up to 2016, with Kirsty Williams AM stating that there is no lack of confidence in the data, but rather a need for a different way of measuring success in schools. The meeting touched upon the target of 37% of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold, with Kirsty Williams AM explaining that they are moving away from the level 2 threshold and developing a new suite of performance indicators in line with the new accountability measures. The meeting also addressed the support for looked-after children and adopted children, with discussions on the PDG for looked-after children and its visibility compared to the PDG for free-school-meal pupils.

        "In the meeting, it was discussed that the increase in exclusions from school is due to a variety of factors, including challenging behavior, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and a lack of capacity in the education system to provide appropriate support. Local authorities are working on strategies to support and reintegrate at-risk learners, but there are challenges in terms of funding and training for staff. The accountability measures in schools may also contribute to the rise in exclusions. There are concerns about the impact on learners with additional learning needs and the need for adequate support and provision in EOTAS settings.

However, there were some concerns raised, such as the need for clarification and simplification of language, the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions in religious education, and the teaching of relationships and sexuality education (RSE). \n\nThe Welsh Government is reflecting on the feedback received and will make refinements to the guidance based on the feedback. The process of reflection and refinement is being led by subject specialists and practitioners. The final curriculum will be published in January 2020, and the legislation will be introduced following the Easter recess. The aim is to have the new curriculum implemented in September 2022.\n\nIn regards to the legislation, the Welsh Government plans to include the 'what matters' statements and a statutory framework for progression in the primary legislation.

The specific wording of the 'what matters' statements will be included in secondary legislation. \n\nThere were concerns raised about potential unintended consequences of the curriculum, such as the exacerbation of segregation between different groups of pupils. The Welsh Government values the work of the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) and will consider their findings. However, the Minister emphasized that the curriculum alone will not lead to less equity in the education system, as the four enabling objectives (strong leadership, excellent teaching, assessment and accountability, and well-being) are crucial to achieving equity. \n\nThe Minister acknowledged concerns about the accountability framework and the potential for inconsistency in how the curriculum is delivered. The Welsh Government is working to ensure that the accountability framework aligns with the aims and objectives of the curriculum and that there is consistency across all schools. \n\nProgress has been made in bridging the gap between the Welsh Government and local government, with renewed engagement and support from the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales.

        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector include the impact of a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, increased overall costs, uncertainty due to the Augar review in England, and Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales and are being faced by universities across the UK. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was already a funding gap between Wales and England, and Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England. This funding gap has put additional strain on Welsh universities.\n\nThe financial indicators for universities in Wales are not showing any significant warning signals, but there are concerns about the long-term sustainability of the sector. Universities have reserves, but a large portion of these reserves are tied up in their estates and are not immediately available as liquid cash. Universities are also facing increasing costs, including the costs of servicing their borrowings for investments in their estates. The operating cash generated by universities in Wales is lower than that of English institutions, which impacts their capacity to meet their costs.\n\nWhile there are financial challenges, the situation is being managed and there is no immediate risk of institutions falling over. However, there may be a need for institutions to take out more costs, resulting in job losses and a reduction in capacity. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, including the increase in resource through the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, is seen as crucial in addressing these challenges. The sector's performance in areas such as student satisfaction and research impact is positive, but there are concerns about the long-term impact of the financial challenges on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales.\n\nIn terms of governance, Welsh universities operate under the guidance of the Committee of University Chairs' code of governance, which sets out best practices for governing bodies. There are regular reviews of governance arrangements, and there is a need to ensure a consistent minimum set of expectations across institutions. The role of the governing body becomes even more significant in times of financial pressure, and institutions are expected to engage with the challenges they face. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales has a risk review process in place to monitor institutions and intervene if necessary to protect the interests of students.\n\nIn terms of part-time student funding, there is a need to maintain and support part-time provision in Wales. Funding has been allocated to support collaboration between higher education and further education institutions, and efforts are being made to improve transparency around the use of fee income. The impact of Brexit and the loss of European Union funds is being addressed through recommendations from the Reid review, which highlight the importance of investment in research and innovation and the need for better engagement with UK-wide developments. Efforts are being made to increase funding for innovation and to improve Wales' ability to access funding from UKRI.\n\nOverall, while there are financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector, efforts are being made to address them and ensure the sustainability and success of the sector in the long term.",
        "During the meeting, the issue of financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector was discussed. The main pressures, barriers, and causes for these challenges were explored. It was noted that the issue of teacher recruitment and retention is a common problem across the globe, and not unique to Wales. The financial incentives offered to teachers in England have not solved the problem either. The meeting also touched on the need for diversity in the teaching workforce and the importance of bringing in career changers with different life experiences. \n\nIn regards to the Welsh higher education sector, the meeting discussed the need to improve the number of Welsh speakers in teaching through the medium of Welsh. The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in initial teacher education reported a need for improvement, and the Minister and officials are working to implement the recommendations of the report. Financial incentives have been introduced to address the issue, but ambitious targets will need to be met over the next three years. The meeting also touched on the need to ensure that Welsh language skills are kept alive in teaching qualifications and to provide more opportunities for part-time study. \n\nThe meeting also discussed the reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector. The Minister expressed her commitment to pursuing the recommendations of the Hazelkorn report, which aims to improve the post-compulsory education and training sector. The Minister stated that there is no formal policy for mergers, but collaboration between institutions is encouraged. The Minister also expressed her commitment to the PCET Bill and stated that it is on track to be introduced before the end of the fifth Assembly. \n\nThe meeting also addressed the issue of investment in vocational education and the need to achieve parity of esteem between academic and vocational education. The Minister stated that investment will be focused on areas of skills shortages and that the government will work with employers to ensure that courses meet their needs. The meeting also discussed the need for improved mental health support for students and the development of a mental health charter for universities. The Minister stated that HEFCW is developing a strategic approach to well-being and mental health for students and is working with universities to create an action plan. The meeting also discussed the role of the regional skills partnerships in supporting Welsh-medium provision in post-16 education. The Minister stated that there is more work to be done in this area and that the recommendations of the Graystone review are being actioned.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector were discussed in a meeting.

Overall, the meeting addressed several challenges and areas for improvement in the Welsh higher education sector.",
        "During the meeting, several factors were identified as potential pressures and barriers for the Welsh higher education sector. These include financial challenges, changes to student support arrangements, a decrease in applications from EU and non-EU students, pay and pension costs, increased student expectations, and uncertainty about future funding and the impact of Brexit. The financial challenges facing the sector include the implementation of the recommendations made by the Diamond review, which will take time to be fully implemented, and the need for additional capital investment to enhance competitiveness. The decrease in applications from EU students is attributed to changes in student support arrangements and the attractiveness of institutions' facilities and infrastructure. The potential impacts of Brexit on the sector include the loss of EU funding for students and research, difficulties in maintaining collaborative research activities, and potential changes to student mobility and immigration status. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) has been working closely with the Welsh Government and the sector to address these challenges and provide support. The sector is actively planning for various scenarios and engaging with stakeholders to enhance its competitiveness and attractiveness. HEFCW also highlighted the importance of continued investment in research and the need to maintain and strengthen collaborative networks and partnerships. The sector is managing its financial challenges and working towards long-term sustainability, but the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the availability of transition funding are causes for concern. HEFCW has advised the Welsh Government on the potential impacts of Brexit and the need for transition funding, but the final decisions and funding allocations are dependent on the political and budgetary processes. The sector is committed to addressing these challenges and finding alternative funding sources, such as the charitable sector, while continuing to deliver high-quality education and research. HEFCW will continue to monitor the sector and provide guidance and support as needed.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are diverse and complex. During a meeting, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams, discussed several factors contributing to these challenges. \n\nOne of the main concerns is the potential impact of Brexit on higher education. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has led to a decrease in EU student applications in Wales, making it the only country in the UK to experience such a drop. This decrease in applications can be attributed to the change in government policy regarding student support, specifically the removal of tuition fee grants for EU students. This change has made studying in Wales less attractive for EU students compared to other countries in the UK. However, Williams believes that the Welsh higher education sector still has a strong offer and can market itself effectively to attract international students.\n\nAnother challenge facing the Welsh higher education sector is the financial deficit. Even without considering the impact of Brexit, higher education in Wales is already in a managed deficit. The funding announcements from the Diamond and Reid reviews are still awaited, which adds to the uncertainty. However, Williams assures that the Welsh Government is fully committed to implementing the Diamond review proposals and has provided additional funding to support this. The long-term sustainability of funding for the sector remains a concern, especially if there is a 'no deal' Brexit scenario.\n\nIn terms of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification, Williams values the qualification and believes it provides a broad and balanced curriculum for Welsh students. She highlights positive feedback from students and teachers who have found the qualification valuable in developing skills for further study and the workforce. However, there have been concerns raised about workload issues and the ability to balance the Welsh bac with other qualifications. Williams acknowledges the need for improvement and refinement of the qualification and emphasizes the importance of effective leadership and support from teachers and school leaders in delivering the qualification.\n\nOverall, the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are multifaceted, with Brexit and the sustainability of funding being major concerns. The Welsh Government is committed to addressing these challenges and working with stakeholders to ensure the continued success of the higher education sector in Wales.",

        "Dr. David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, discussed the impact of Brexit on Wales' higher education system during a meeting. He stated that the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has had an impact on the relationships and arrangements with Europe, which is a significant issue for university management. The HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income from the EU, such as EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding. The drop in EU students applying to study in Wales is one of the impacts of Brexit that has already been observed. Dr. Blaney mentioned that the change in student support arrangements for EU students, who now have to pay the full fee, may be a factor affecting their decision to study in Wales. He also highlighted the importance of investment in facilities and infrastructure, as well as the need for Wales to promote itself as a safe and supportive place to study. In terms of financial pressures, Dr. Blaney mentioned the funding position, pay and pension costs, student recruitment, and uncertainty about potential consequences arising from the review of fees and funding in England. He stated that institutions are working to minimize cost reductions and maintain infrastructure while waiting for funding from the Diamond recommendations to be implemented. However, the exact amount of funding and the timeline for its release are still uncertain. Dr. Blaney emphasized the need for clarity and the potential challenges if funding is delayed or not sufficient. He also discussed the importance of attracting research funding from UK research councils and the charitable sector, as well as the need for investment in research capacity and infrastructure. Overall, the impact of Brexit on Wales' higher education system is still uncertain, but there are concerns about the potential decline in EU student enrollment and the need for continued investment and support for the sector.",

        "The impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education is still uncertain, but there are some potential challenges that have been identified. One of the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector is the funding position. The recommendations made by the Diamond review are in the process of being implemented, but the full funding is expected to take longer. Universities are trying to minimize cost reductions in order to maintain infrastructure and be prepared for future funding. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has also led to a decrease in applications from EU students and non-EU international students. There are also pressures related to pay and pension costs, increased student expectations, and the potential consequences of the Augar review in England. In terms of financial forecasting, universities are providing financial forecasts to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) and are planning for capital investment in their strategies. However, the exact impact of Brexit on funding and student numbers is still uncertain. The Welsh Government's HE Brexit working group is working to assess the risks and potential impact of Brexit on the sector. Individual institutions are also planning for different scenarios, but the details of these plans are not publicly available.

        "The discussion during the meeting revolved around the issues with HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) and the decision made regarding them. One of the main points of discussion was the targeting of funding towards improving educational outcomes, specifically the pupil development grant (PDG). The committee questioned the effectiveness of the grant and whether it was being properly targeted towards children eligible for free school meals. The representatives from Estyn (the education and training inspectorate for Wales) acknowledged that the targeting of the grant has improved over time, but there are still some issues with schools interpreting poverty in a wider way and not strictly focusing on children eligible for free school meals. They also noted that there is a lack of targeting towards more able and talented pupils who receive free school meals. \n\nThe representatives from Estyn also discussed the use of the PDG by schools and highlighted that it is being used for a variety of activities such as tracking progress, improving attendance, working with families and the community, and improving exam results. They acknowledged that there is still room for improvement in how the grant is used and how more able and talented pupils are identified and supported. They also discussed the importance of schools engaging with initiatives like the Seren network to support more able and talented pupils. \n\nIn terms of the effectiveness of the PDG, the representatives from Estyn noted that the use of the grant is often linked to the leadership capacity of schools. They also highlighted the importance of evaluation and the need for schools to effectively evaluate how the grant is being used. \n\nOverall, the representatives from Estyn acknowledged that while there have been improvements in the targeting and use of the PDG, there are still areas where further progress can be made. They emphasized the importance of strong leadership and effective evaluation in ensuring that the grant is used effectively to improve educational outcomes.",
        "In the meeting, it was discussed that there are issues with the implementation of the HMRC and decisions were made regarding them. One of the main concerns raised was the overuse of targeting key stage 4 and the focus on achieving C grades in particular. It was argued that this approach does not develop long-term transferable skills for students or produce the skills that teachers need. Instead, it was suggested that improving the curriculum and teaching quality would be a more sustainable solution. \n\nThere was also discussion about the performance indicators driving the focus on key stage 4. It was acknowledged that there is a general acknowledgement of the impact of performance indicators on school decisions. However, there was also recognition that decisions made in schools regarding the application of the PDG are evidence-based, with schools using research findings to inform their decisions. The Sutton Trust toolkit was highlighted as a valuable resource for schools to access research evidence. \n\nThe issue of attendance at key stage 4 for students eligible for free school meals was also raised. While it was acknowledged that attendance has improved for these students, there was recognition that it is still a major problem. The use of the PDG to improve attendance was discussed, with the need for more attention on community-focused schooling and working with families highlighted as potential solutions. Examples of schools that have made progress in improving attendance through community relationships and working with parents were mentioned. \n\nThe meeting also discussed the effectiveness of the PDG in narrowing the attainment gap for students eligible for free school meals at key stage 4. It was acknowledged that while there have been improvements in attendance, there is still a major problem. The need for more attention on community-focused schooling and tailoring the curriculum to the needs of these students was emphasized. The use of the PDG to appoint staff to facilitate community engagement and provide one-on-one support to students was mentioned as a potential strategy. \n\nIn terms of the decision-making process in schools, it was recognized that more could be done to ensure decisions are evidence-based and properly evaluated. The importance of schools evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and practices implemented was emphasized. The need for strong strategic leadership in schools and the role of headteachers in building strong relationships with families and communities was also discussed. The importance of sharing best practices and learning from other schools was highlighted as a way to improve outcomes for students. \n\nOverall, the discussion highlighted the challenges and issues with the implementation of the PDG and the need for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to improving outcomes for students. The importance of evidence-based decision making, community engagement, and collaboration between schools and other stakeholders was emphasized as key factors in addressing these challenges.",
        "The Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 was introduced to address issues related to the regulation of institutions in Wales, safeguarding the use of public funds, promoting fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy. However, there have been concerns about the effectiveness of the Act in achieving these objectives.\n\nOne of the main issues raised is the lack of flexibility in the Act and the difficulty in using its powers of intervention. HEFCW, the regulatory body, has stated that the Act's powers are inflexible and hard to use, making sanctions difficult to enforce. There have also been concerns about the balance between regulating different types of institutions, with private providers being seen as less regulated than public institutions.\n\nIn terms of fee and access plans, there have been criticisms that the current system is bureaucratic and does not effectively address national priorities. The Act requires institutions to submit annual fee and access plans, but there is a need for a more long-term and outcome-focused approach. The new PCET (post-compulsory education and training) Bill aims to address these issues by introducing outcome agreements that focus on outputs and outcomes rather than inputs.\n\nThere have also been concerns about governance in the higher education sector. The Act does not directly address governance issues, but there is recognition of the need for improvement. An independent review of governance is currently underway, and the findings will inform the PCET Bill, which will introduce a regulatory condition for good governance.\n\nOverall, the Act has some limitations and there is a need for reform to address the issues raised. The new PCET Bill aims to provide a more flexible and effective regulatory framework, with a focus on outcomes and good governance.",

        "The findings and concerns raised by WISERD research regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system were discussed in a meeting. The meeting highlighted the persistent attainment gap between students eligible for free school meals and those who are not eligible, as well as the performance of looked-after children and children from ethnic minority groups. The meeting also discussed the investment of \u00a3475 million in the pupil development grant to close the attainment gap, but acknowledged that more needs to be done as the problem persists and, in some cases, worsens.\n\nThe meeting also touched on the performance of students in Wales compared to the average in OECD countries. While students in Wales were found to be relatively more able to overcome the disadvantage of their background, there is still a gap in performance between students eligible for free school meals and their better-off counterparts. The meeting highlighted the progress that has been made in terms of basic qualifications, with an increase in the percentage of children achieving a level 1 qualification. However, it was acknowledged that there is still work to be done, particularly in providing support to children from an early age.\n\nIn terms of minority ethnic learners, the meeting discussed the need for a more sophisticated conversation about attainment across different ethnic groups to better target resources and address gaps in performance. The meeting also addressed the performance of looked-after children, with the 2019 data set to be published next month. The meeting acknowledged the need for improvement in this group and discussed the measures that have been put in place, such as the employment of PDG LAC coordinators and the testing of new approaches like virtual school approaches.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the ongoing concerns and challenges in closing the attainment gap and improving the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. The meeting also recognized the need for continued investment and support, as well as the importance of early intervention and collaboration among institutions and stakeholders.",

        "The Welsh baccalaureate qualification is valued by both learners and teachers. While there are some concerns raised about the workload and consistency in delivering the qualification, overall, it is seen as a valuable and rigorous qualification. The variability in how the qualification is delivered may be due to it being a relatively new qualification and different schools adopting it at different rates. Efforts are being made to ensure greater consistency in delivery, including the design group of Qualifications Wales and professional learning opportunities for teachers. There is also a need to better engage employers with the qualification and communicate its value to them. In terms of university acceptance, the Welsh baccalaureate is seen as an equivalent qualification to A-levels by universities in Wales and is used as part of the admissions process. While there may be some variability in how universities make offers, the overall feedback is positive and the qualification is seen as valuable for students.",
        "The increase in exclusions from school can be attributed to various factors, including challenging behavior, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and a lack of capacity in the education system to meet the needs of students. Local authorities are implementing strategies to support and reintegrate students at risk of exclusion, including the development of behavior and well-being strategies, multi-agency approaches, and collaboration between schools, pupil referral units (PRUs), and local authorities. Funding challenges can impact the provision of support for additional learning needs, but efforts are being made to address this, such as devolving funding to schools and providing training for staff. However, there are concerns about the impact of changes to registration of EOTAS (Education Otherwise Than At School) pupils and the management of data, funding, and joint working. Quality assurance and monitoring of EOTAS provision, particularly in privately run settings, can be challenging, but local authorities are working to ensure safeguarding and quality standards are maintained. The transition from EOTAS provision to mainstream education can be complex, but efforts are being made to support learners and provide a continuum of provision. Challenges in delivering a broad and balanced curriculum for EOTAS learners include capacity issues, safeguarding concerns, and the need for quality assurance and monitoring. Efforts are being made to collaborate, provide staff training, and ensure that the curriculum is delivered effectively in PRUs and other EOTAS provisions. However, there is still work to be done to ensure that all EOTAS learners have access to appropriate learning opportunities.",
        "Based on the given meeting, the findings and concerns raised by WISERD research regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system are as follows:\n\n1. Collaboration between Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) and schools is seen as the answer to ensure that learners from different socio-economic backgrounds have what they need.\n2. There is a concern about inconsistency in the education system, with variations in provision and support for students from different backgrounds.\n3. There is a need for better support for students with Additional Learning Needs (ALN) in EOTAS (Education Other Than At School) settings, as it is currently challenging for them to access ALN support.\n4. The capacity and expertise of staff in EOTAS settings is a concern, with a need for more dedicated educational psychologists and specialized teachers.\n5. There is a need for better access to mental health services for EOTAS learners, with variations in provision across different regions.\n6. School accountability measures may have an impact on the numbers of exclusions, and there is a need to balance the focus on academic outcomes with support for students' well-being.\n7. The impact of early trauma and adverse childhood experiences on students' well-being and behavior is a concern, and there is a need for schools to adapt their practices to take account of these factors.\n8. There is a concern about the support provided to students at risk of becoming EOTAS, with a need for a whole-school approach and better training for teachers to support these students.\n9. There is a need for a better balance between funding for diagnosis and support, with a recognition that support is important even without a formal diagnosis.\n10. There is a concern about the labeling of students as \"naughty\" or \"disruptive\" instead of recognizing their underlying needs, especially for students with additional learning needs or communication difficulties.\n11. There is a need for better coordination and clarity of responsibility for supporting excluded students, with involvement from schools, local authorities, parents, and other relevant stakeholders.\n12. The impact of delays in accessing EOTAS provision on students' well-being is a concern, and there is a need for better data and understanding of this issue.\n13. The impact of individual tuition, such as home schooling, on students' well-being is unclear, but there is a need for transparency and support for students in these situations.\n14. There is a need for better support for excluded students, not just in the educational setting but also in other areas of their lives, to prevent further disadvantages and vulnerability.\n15. There is a need for better training and support for teachers in recognizing and addressing mental health issues in students, with a focus on the whole-school approach and embedding mental health awareness in the curriculum.\n16.

        "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services discussed amendments related to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation. The Deputy Minister explained that she had tabled amendments in response to a recommendation from the Children, Young People and Education Committee. The amendments included placing a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences.\n\nThe committee members raised concerns and proposed amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness and the need for a post-implementation review of the legislation. The Deputy Minister addressed these concerns, stating that the amendments proposed were unnecessary as the government was already committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign and a continuous program of work to assess the effectiveness of the legislation. She also assured the committee that all the issues raised would be considered and addressed by the expert stakeholder group working on the implementation of the Bill.\n\nThe committee members also discussed the need for sufficient funding to support the implementation of the legislation. The Deputy Minister acknowledged the concerns and committed to providing further details on the costs associated with the post-implementation review in a revised regulatory impact assessment at Stage 3.\n\nIn summary, the discussions during the meeting focused on the importance of raising public awareness about the legislation and the need for a comprehensive review of its impact. The Deputy Minister assured the committee that the government was committed to these objectives and would work towards achieving them.",
        "The Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 was introduced to regulate institutions in Wales, safeguard public funding, ensure fair access, and protect institutional autonomy. The effectiveness of the Act in achieving these objectives has been debated, with some stakeholders expressing concerns about its limitations. The Act has focused on individual institutions rather than encouraging collaboration and has been criticized for not providing enough policy levers to align the sector with the social, economic, and civic needs of Wales. Additionally, the Act has been seen as inflexible and lacking in effective measures for intervention and sanctions.\n\nIn terms of fee and access plans, there have been concerns about their bureaucratic nature and the lack of confidence in their effectiveness. The Act has not struck the right balance in terms of regulating risk and has been criticized for placing more regulation on institutions with strong track records while leaving riskier private alternative providers less regulated.\n\nLooking ahead, the new Post-Compulsory Education and Training (PCET) Bill will aim to address these issues and provide a more effective regulatory framework. The new bill will focus on outcome agreements rather than fee and access plans, allowing for a longer-term and outcome-focused approach. The aim is to strike a balance between regulation and institutional autonomy, while also encouraging collaboration and addressing issues of poor governance in the sector.",

It was noted that stakeholders were broadly content with the current situation and that any changes to the quality assurance regime would need to be coherent, effective, and compatible with ENQA and UK-wide baseline standards.\n\nThe issue of overseas providers was also raised, with concerns about the need for appropriate quality guarantees and compatibility with ENQA and UK-wide baseline standards. HEFCW and the QAA were mentioned as organizations working on quality assurance of offshore activity.\n\nIn summary, the discussions and opinions in the meeting focused on the need for improved governance arrangements in universities, the importance of diversity in governing bodies, the challenges and improvements needed in quality assurance in further education colleges, and the need for quality guarantees in overseas provision.",

        "Barry Hughes, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales, expressed his thoughts on various aspects of the childcare offer during a meeting with the Children, Young People and Education Committee. He discussed the current legal framework and how it protects children, noting that there are specific offences in place to protect children from physical assault. However, he also acknowledged that the defence of reasonable punishment is available for assault on a child, which is not available for assault on an adult. He suggested that this difference in legal protection could be seen as children having fewer rights than adults.\n\nHughes also discussed the proposed changes to the law and the potential impact on the legal framework. He acknowledged that removing the defence of reasonable punishment would make things clearer, but also noted that there are shades of grey in determining what constitutes reasonable punishment. He provided examples to illustrate the spectrum of offending and the factors that would be considered in determining whether to prosecute.\n\nIn terms of the legal framework in Wales and England, Hughes discussed the potential implications of implementing the Bill in Wales. He highlighted the potential for confusion and the need for awareness raising, particularly for people travelling from England to Wales. He also mentioned the need to update CPS guidance to reflect the changes in the law.\n\nRegarding the registration of grandparents, Hughes did not provide specific thoughts on this aspect of the childcare offer.\n\nIn terms of performance measures and targets, Hughes stated that the number of prosecutions resulting from the Bill would be small and unlikely to have a significant impact on performance measures. He also emphasized that the CPS does not have targets for securing convictions and that decisions on prosecutions are based on the evidence and public interest considerations.\n\nRegarding unintended consequences, Hughes acknowledged the potential for increased malicious reporting and the impact on individuals' life prospects if convicted. However, he believed that the numbers would be small and that the focus should be on the message the legislation sends and the protection it provides for children.\n\nIn terms of implementation, Hughes stated that the CPS would work with the Welsh Government and other stakeholders to develop guidance and ensure a smooth transition. He also mentioned the need to maintain awareness of the legislation and monitor its impact over time.\n\nOverall, Hughes provided detailed insights into various aspects of the legal framework and implementation of the childcare offer, highlighting potential challenges and considerations.",
        "During the meeting, it was discussed that the childcare system is an important employer and that the goal is to provide parents with the opportunity to work while ensuring that children have a positive early years experience. The current system was described as complex and in need of simplification. Pilot projects are being conducted in several local authorities to explore ways of simplifying and integrating the system. The Welsh Government is planning to make an announcement soon regarding the direction they want to take.\n\nBarry Hughes, the Assistant Minister, expressed the need for a more child-centered approach and the desire to expand the childcare offer to include parents in education and training. The aim is to make the offer more universal and accessible to all families. However, it was acknowledged that there are financial considerations and that the government is working within budgetary constraints.\n\nThe meeting also touched on the evaluation of the childcare offer and the need for more data to determine its impact. It was mentioned that 94% of parents were already using formal childcare before the offer was introduced. The Minister acknowledged that it takes time for a new program to reach its full potential and that the evaluation will provide more meaningful results in the future.\n\nRegarding the legal framework, infrastructure of out-of-court disposals, targets for performance measures, and the registration of grandparents in relation to the childcare offer, no specific information was provided during the meeting.",
        "The implementation of the Bill will require close collaboration between various agencies and organizations, such as social services, the police, education sector, and health visitors. These agencies are already working together and have indicated their willingness to support the implementation of the Bill. The threshold for intervention by social services is not expected to change, and there is no anticipation of a significant increase in referrals to social services. The effectiveness of the implementation will not depend on the establishment of multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs), although they are welcomed and may be considered in the future. The training of teachers and other professionals will be incorporated into existing training programs and procedures. The mapping exercise being conducted will identify gaps in service provision and opportunities for improvement in parenting support programs. The implementation group is also considering suitable interventions, such as diversion schemes and community resolutions, to address cases of physical punishment without resorting to criminal prosecution. The impact on parents will be monitored through ongoing evaluation and data collection. The Healthy Child Wales program and health visitors will play a crucial role in raising awareness and providing support to parents. The concerns raised by the National Association of Head Teachers and social workers have been taken into account, and efforts will be made to ensure that the implementation of the Bill does not overwhelm existing services or create additional burdens on professionals. The focus will be on early intervention and providing support to families in a coordinated and robust manner. The mapping exercise will help identify areas where more investment is needed and where gaps in service provision exist. The impact of the Bill on reporting and disclosure of non-conviction data will be considered within the existing framework and guidelines followed by the police. Overall, the implementation of the Bill will require careful planning, collaboration, and ongoing evaluation to ensure its successful and effective implementation.",
        "Barry Hughes had several thoughts on different aspects of the childcare offer. \n\nRegarding the legal framework, he believed that the administrative burden of the current approach, which requires parents to provide proof of eligibility, is a major issue. He suggested that a centralized system, similar to the HM Revenue and Customs model, would be more efficient and less bureaucratic. \n\nIn terms of infrastructure, he acknowledged that there may be challenges in areas with higher costs, such as Cardiff and Newport. However, he expressed confidence that the current rate of \u00a34.50 per hour is suitable and that any adjustments can be made as necessary during the pilot phase. He also mentioned the possibility of exploring different rates for more expensive areas.\n\nWhen it came to performance measures, he highlighted the need to monitor and assess the development of the rollout. He mentioned that evaluations are being conducted to gather feedback from providers and parents, and adjustments can be made based on the findings.\n\nFinally, in relation to the registration of grandparents, he explained that the focus of the childcare offer is on registered and licensed providers. While there may be some registered grandparents who provide childcare, the offer is not intended for informal caregivers. He emphasized the importance of quality and the educational aspects of the scheme.\n\nOverall, Barry Hughes acknowledged the challenges and complexities of implementing the childcare offer, but expressed confidence that the Welsh Government is taking the necessary steps to address them and ensure the success of the program.",
        "The evidence suggests that the Brexit process has had an impact on Welsh higher education. The uncertainty surrounding the relationships and arrangements with Europe is a significant issue for university management. The impact on higher education in Wales includes a decrease in applications from EU students and non-EU international students. The change in student support arrangements for EU students, as well as perceptions about safety and the quality of facilities, may be contributing factors. Additionally, the lack of investment in capital infrastructure in recent years may have affected the competitiveness of Welsh universities. The financial pressures faced by the sector include funding reductions, pay and pension costs, and increased student expectations. The uncertainty surrounding the review of fees and funding in England is also a concern. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales is working with universities to address these challenges and ensure long-term financial sustainability.

However, there were concerns about the rigidity and complexity of the qualification, and the need for more input from employers to ensure that the skills developed through the Welsh bac align with industry needs. \n\nRegarding the demand for Welsh language skills, it was noted that there is a need for clearer communication and engagement with employers, parents, and young people to emphasize the value of the Welsh language and the benefits of bilingualism. \n\nIn summary, the meeting highlighted the need for clearer communication and collaboration between employers, educational institutions, and the Welsh Government to address the demand for Welsh language skills and develop effective strategies for skills development. There was a recognition of the importance of the Welsh bac in developing employability skills, but also a call for improvements in the qualification to better align with industry needs.",

        "During the meeting, the discussion focused on the demand for Welsh language skills and the strategies used to develop pupils' skills in analyzing and combining information into a discursive argument. The top priority in skills development was also discussed. Nicola Edwards emphasized the need for teaching language skills, while Julie Morgan recommended addressing the demand for Welsh language skills and provided reasons behind it. \n\nThe meeting also touched on the need for resources to support the curriculum and the ongoing work to identify those resources. The discussion then shifted to the single continuum of learning for the Welsh language and how progression steps and achievement outcomes will work in both Welsh-medium and English-medium schools. The importance of a Welsh dimension across the curriculum was highlighted. \n\nThe conversation then turned to the decision to opt out of creative thinking tests in the PISA 2020 assessment. Kirsty Williams explained that the decision was based on the timing, as schools would be in the middle of preparing for the new curriculum in 2021. However, she emphasized that creativity is valued in the Welsh education system and that Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD. \n\nThe meeting also covered topics such as physical activity in schools, the continuity of the foundation phase in the new curriculum, the transition to post-16 education, governance arrangements, and the inclusion of pupil referral units in the new curriculum. \n\nIn terms of funding, it was mentioned that the Welsh Government has allocated additional funding to support the higher education sector in dealing with the impact of Brexit. The specific use of this funding was not outlined in the meeting. It was also discussed that there has been a drop in EU student applications in Wales due to changes in student support policies, but efforts are being made to promote Wales as an attractive destination for international students. \n\nConcerns were raised about the uncertainty surrounding funding for higher and further education after Brexit, particularly with regards to EU funding. The Welsh Government expressed a commitment to maintaining learning opportunities currently supported by EU funding, but acknowledged that the outcome would depend on negotiations with the UK Government. The importance of multi-year funding settlements was also highlighted, but the Welsh Government noted the challenge of achieving this without multi-year budgeting from the UK Government."

        "During the meeting, the group discussed the effectiveness of using eligibility for free school meals as a measure and the impact of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals. The group had differing opinions on the targeting of the PDG and whether it was being used appropriately. The Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams, explained that individual interventions should be targeted at children eligible for free school meals, but schools may also use PDG funding for universal interventions that have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. She provided examples of schools using PDG funding to focus on growth mindset and attachment disorder training, which had shown positive results for children receiving free school meals. \n\nThe group also discussed the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals. Kirsty Williams acknowledged that there was a gap in attendance between children on free school meals and those who were not. She highlighted the importance of addressing this gap and mentioned examples of schools using PDG funding to improve attendance, such as implementing walking buses and providing additional support for families of older children. She also emphasized the need for a multi-agency approach to support children with attendance issues.\n\nThe group then moved on to discuss the impact of PDG on attainment. Kirsty Williams acknowledged that the attainment gap had widened in 2017, but noted that over the period of implementing PDG, there had been a narrowing of the gap. She mentioned several factors that could have contributed to the widening gap, such as changes in exams and the unintended consequences of literature. She also mentioned the need for a more sophisticated performance measure for schools, which takes into account individual progress and value added.\n\nThe group discussed the PDG for looked-after children and adopted children, and the lack of awareness among schools about its availability. Kirsty Williams explained that the PDG for looked-after children is held at a regional level and is used to provide targeted support based on individual needs. She acknowledged the need for better communication and information sharing between schools and adoptive parents to ensure that children receive the support they need.\n\nThe group also discussed the disappointing attainment and exclusion rates for looked-after children. Kirsty Williams emphasized the need for a cross-government approach to support these children, including improvements in the ALN system and collaboration between social services, health services, and education. She mentioned ongoing evaluations and reviews to identify areas for improvement.\n\nThe group discussed the Schools Challenge Cymru program and the lessons learned from its implementation. Kirsty Williams acknowledged the mixed results of the program and the importance of strong leadership, effective systems and processes, teacher quality, and collaborative activity. She emphasized that the lessons learned from Schools Challenge Cymru are being applied to the wider school improvement agenda, including the use of improvement boards and the categorization system to provide targeted support to schools. She also highlighted the ongoing support from the regional consortia and the positive progress made by some schools even after the end of the program.\n\nOverall",
        "During the meeting, Estyn provided several insights into the effectiveness of using the eligibility for free school meals as a measure and the impact of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals.\n\nEstyn acknowledged that the targeting of the PDG has improved over time, although there are still instances where the funding is not exclusively used for children eligible for free school meals. Some schools interpret poverty in a broader sense and provide support to a wider cohort of disadvantaged students. However, Estyn believes that the targeting of the grant is generally within the spirit of the program.\n\nEstyn also highlighted the need for better support for more able and talented students receiving free school meals. They mentioned that schools often focus on underachieving students and may not identify the underachievement of more able students who could benefit from additional support.\n\nIn terms of the effectiveness of the PDG, Estyn stated that it is difficult to measure the direct impact of the grant. While there have been improvements in attendance and some positive outcomes, the attainment gap between students eligible for free school meals and their peers has not significantly closed. Estyn emphasized the importance of strong leadership, effective use of research and evidence, and community engagement in maximizing the impact of the PDG.\n\nEstyn also discussed the challenges and unintended consequences of performance measures on the effectiveness of the PDG. Changes in performance indicators have led to shifts in school priorities and approaches, which can have both positive and negative effects on student outcomes.\n\nRegarding looked-after and adopted children, Estyn highlighted some confusion and lack of clarity among schools regarding the use of the PDG for these groups. However, there have been improvements in tracking and support for looked-after children, and regional consortia are working to address the specific needs of this cohort.\n\nOverall, Estyn acknowledged the variability in the success of the Schools Challenge Cymru program and emphasized the need for longer-term initiatives and a focus on sustainable improvements in curriculum, teaching quality, and community engagement to effectively support disadvantaged students.",
        "The group's opinion on the effectiveness of using eligibility for free school meals as a measure is mixed. They noted that the PDG (Pupil Development Grant) had some success in improving attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, but it was not seen as a panacea for all struggling schools. The effectiveness of the PDG varied depending on the collaboration between different agencies, such as the challenge adviser, local authority, and regional consortia. The group also discussed the need for a longer period of time, at least three years, to properly evaluate the impact of initiatives like the PDG. They also highlighted the importance of evaluating the success of the PDG and other initiatives in order to make informed decisions about future policies and programs.",

They noted that PDG has led to increased attendance rates and improved engagement among these students. They also mentioned that PDG has helped to address the achievement gap and improve educational outcomes for children from low-income backgrounds.\n\nThe group acknowledged that there are still challenges to be addressed, such as the need for more consistent provision of early childhood education and care across different parts of Wales. They discussed the variations in the amount of provision available in different areas and the reasons behind these variations. They mentioned that local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education, which has led to differences in the amount of provision available.\n\nThe group also discussed the need for a more integrated approach towards early years education and care. They highlighted the importance of maintaining high-quality standards and ensuring that the foundation phase is delivered effectively in non-maintained settings. They mentioned that joint inspections by Estyn and CIW have been implemented to monitor the quality of provision in non-maintained settings.\n\nIn relation to the eligibility criteria for the childcare offer, the group mentioned that the current focus is on working parents, but there are plans to extend the offer to parents in education and training. They acknowledged that there are financial considerations that need to be taken into account, but they are committed to making the necessary funding available to deliver on the offer. They also mentioned the importance of working with local authorities to ensure that facilities are developed in each area to meet the needs of families and children.\n\nThe group discussed the decision to suspend the work with HMRC and the reasons behind it. They mentioned that the decision was driven by the need for a more flexible approach that can accommodate changes in eligibility criteria and reach a wider group of children. They also highlighted technical issues related to the Welsh language standards and the cost implications of working with HMRC.\n\nIn relation to Flying Start, the group discussed the need to reach a wider group of children and expand the benefits of the program. They mentioned the importance of collaborative working between different agencies, such as health visitors and childcare providers, to support children and families.

However, there may be some inconsistency in how universities use the qualification for application purposes. Overall, the Cabinet Secretary is committed to ensuring the rigour and value of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification.",
        "During the meeting, the Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams, provided an update on the progress of developing the new curriculum for Wales. The main messages received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum included support for the need for change, support for the four purposes of the curriculum, and support for greater autonomy and agency for teachers.

The Minister stated that the feedback will be reflected upon and considered in the refinement of the curriculum. The next steps include further workshops with subject specialists, an editorial process for refining the curriculum, and final publication in January 2020. The Minister also announced that certain aspects of the curriculum, such as the \"what matters\" statements and the framework for progression, will be included in the primary legislation. The \"what matters\" statements will provide clarity and consistency at a national level, while still allowing flexibility for individual schools. The Minister also mentioned that feedback on religious education and relationships and sexuality education was received, and a response will be provided in the future.",
        "During the meeting, it was discussed that the group's opinion on the effectiveness of using eligibility for free school meals as a measure was divided. Some members believed that it was an important measure to identify students in need, while others felt that it was not the role of the education system to determine eligibility for free school meals. There were concerns raised about the potential challenges for staff in discussing issues that they personally did not agree with in the curriculum.\n\nIn terms of evaluating the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement for children receiving free school meals, it was mentioned that there were strong views that decisions about access to the full curriculum should be made by parents rather than schools or the state. It was also emphasized that these aspects of the curriculum were important for achieving the four purposes of education in Wales.\n\nRegarding the timetable for the Bill and seeking Royal Assent, it was mentioned that a final draft of the curriculum would be published in January 2020. The expectation was to introduce the Bill following the Easter recess, with the aim of implementing the curriculum in September 2022.\n\nThe group discussed the value of the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) and the presentation by Dr Nigel Newton. It was acknowledged that WISERD's research was helpful in informing the group's work, and there was a commitment to ensuring equity in the education system.\n\nThe group also discussed potential unintended consequences of the curriculum, such as potential segregation within schools between different groups of pupils. It was acknowledged that there was no evidence to suggest that this would happen, but the concerns raised were taken into consideration to inform decision-making. It was emphasized that the success of the curriculum would depend on strong leadership, excellent teaching, effective assessment and accountability, and the well-being of the child.\n\nIn terms of preparations for implementation, it was mentioned that a significant investment had been made in professional learning to support teachers in implementing the curriculum.

There were also plans to support newly qualified teachers and improve coaching and mentoring schemes.\n\nThe group discussed the selection of innovation schools and their role in working with the government on final refinements to the curriculum. The aim was to ensure that the curriculum could be practically implemented in schools, and the selection of schools took into consideration their ability to do so.\n\nThe group also discussed assessment, progression, and accountability. Feedback on the draft assessment proposals was generally positive, with support for the emphasis on ongoing assessment to support children's learning and progression. It was acknowledged that there needed to be better clarity on the purposes of assessment and definitions around formative and summative assessment.\n\nRegarding accountability, it was emphasized that the focus should be on self-evaluation and external verification of that by Estyn, rather than using assessment for accountability purposes.

        "During the meeting, Julie Morgan AM, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, discussed the bill to ban physical punishment and addressed concerns raised by Janet Finch-Saunders AM. She emphasized that the bill is not addressing child abuse but rather aims to protect children's rights and ensure they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. She acknowledged that people have different views on physical punishment but emphasized that any form of physical punishment, no matter how mild, is incompatible with children's human rights. She also highlighted the support for the bill from professionals working with children.\n\nIn response to questions about working with parents, Morgan stated that while bringing up children is difficult, physical punishment should not be part of parenting. She emphasized that there are alternative methods to discipline and that the bill aims to provide clarity and consistency by removing the defense of reasonable punishment. She acknowledged the concerns of parents but stated that the legislation will be implemented in a practical and workable way, with support from various agencies.\n\nRegarding the effectiveness of the bill, Morgan referred to research showing that countries that have banned physical punishment have seen less youth violence. She also acknowledged the mixed evidence in this field but stated that the decision to support the bill is based on the commitment to children's rights.\n\nIn terms of implementation, Morgan discussed the need for ongoing evaluation and monitoring of the legislation's impact. She mentioned the establishment of an independent body to evaluate the effectiveness of the bill and the ongoing monitoring surveys to assess public views. She also highlighted the importance of an awareness campaign to ensure that parents and professionals are aware of the changes.\n\nDuring the discussion on social services, Morgan addressed concerns about the impact on workload for social workers and the need for support services for families. She acknowledged the challenges faced by social workers but expressed confidence that the legislation will not overwhelm social services. She mentioned the ongoing evaluation and data collection to monitor the impact of the bill and highlighted the commitment of social services to work together with other agencies.\n\nRegarding the role of education in implementing the bill, Morgan stated that teachers will be involved in the preparation and that the education sector is represented on the implementation group. She emphasized the importance of awareness campaigns and training for teachers to ensure they are ready to support the legislation.\n\nIn response to questions about the Healthy Child Wales program, Morgan acknowledged the need for more support for parents and mentioned the mapping exercise being conducted to identify gaps in service provision.

        "During the meeting, Barry Hughes, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales, discussed the current law regarding physical punishment and the potential impact of the proposed bill to ban physical punishment. He explained that under the current law, there is a defense of reasonable punishment for assaulting a child, but this defense does not apply to assaulting an adult. He also mentioned that the law should reflect contemporary society and that opinions on physical punishment are changing, particularly among younger generations.\n\nIn terms of the effectiveness of the proposed bill, Hughes stated that it would provide a clearer legal framework by removing the defense of reasonable punishment. However, he also acknowledged that there may still be some gray areas in determining what constitutes reasonable punishment in specific cases.\n\nRegarding the implementation of the bill, Hughes mentioned that there may be some divergence between the law in Wales and England, as the defense of reasonable punishment would still apply in England. He suggested that guidelines and policies would need to be updated to reflect this divergence and that there may be a need for clear communication and awareness-raising to ensure that the public understands the changes in the law.\n\nWhen it comes to the burden of proof, Hughes clarified that the removal of the defense of reasonable punishment would not change the burden or standard of proof. The prosecution would still need to prove that an assault occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, and it would be up to the accused parent to argue that their actions were lawful and reasonable.\n\nIn terms of alternatives to prosecution, Hughes mentioned that there may be cases that do not meet the evidential stage or public interest test for prosecution. He emphasized that prosecution is not always the first course of action and that there are other options such as out-of-court disposals and diversions. He also mentioned the importance of considering the best interests of the child when applying the public interest test.\n\nIn terms of implementation, Hughes mentioned that the CPS would need to keep a record of cases referred to them and that there may be a need for further discussions and reviews to assess the effectiveness of the law and its impact on prosecutions.\n\nOverall, Hughes expressed confidence in the ability of the CPS to adapt to the changes brought about by the bill and to ensure that the law is applied in a fair and proportionate manner.",

The amendments included a duty to promote public awareness about the change in the law and a duty to report on the effect of the legislation.\n\nThe committee members raised concerns about the need for ongoing awareness-raising campaigns and the potential impact of the legislation on certain groups, such as visitors to Wales. They also suggested specific topics that should be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, such as information on alternatives to physical punishment and how to raise concerns about physical assault.\n\nThe Deputy Minister responded by explaining that the amendments were unnecessary as the government was already committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over a period of six years. She also emphasized that the level of detail proposed in the amendments was not required on the face of the bill and that the specific topics to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign would be determined by experts and stakeholders.\n\nThe committee then moved on to discuss the duty to report on the effect of the legislation. The Deputy Minister introduced amendments to require a post-implementation review of the bill's impact. The committee members expressed support for the amendments but suggested shorter reporting periods, such as three years instead of the proposed five to seven years.

Vaughan Gething, the Minister for Health and Social Services, provided an update on the understanding of how the virus impacts children and young people and their role in transmitting the virus. He mentioned that children and young people are less likely to be significantly affected by COVID-19 compared to older people and those with healthcare conditions.

They also mentioned that employers are more focused on professional qualifications and the quality of skills rather than the Welsh bac. However, others mentioned that there are certain universities that do value the Welsh bac and accept it as part of the admissions process, especially local universities like the University of South Wales and Cardiff Metropolitan University. It was also mentioned that there is a need for more input from employers in the review of the qualification to ensure that employability and entrepreneurial skills have a greater role. \n\nIn terms of the Welsh bac's impact on wider education provisions, it was mentioned that some schools and colleges prioritize GCSE resits over the Welsh bac, which can limit the availability of the qualification.

        "The evidence suggests that the Brexit process has had an impact on Welsh higher education. The uncertainty surrounding the relationships and arrangements with Europe is a significant issue for university management. Some of the specific impacts include a decrease in applications from EU students and a reduction in non-EU international student applications. The change in student support arrangements for EU students, as well as the perception of the UK as a less stable partner for EU research collaborations, may be contributing factors to the decline in applications. Other pressures on the Welsh higher education sector include funding constraints, pay and pension costs, increased student expectations for modern facilities, and uncertainty about potential consequences of the Augar review of fees and funding in England. The universities in England may be better at selling themselves internationally, and the perception of Wales as a safe and supportive place to study may be a factor in attracting international students. The financial forecasts for the next few years take into account the potential impacts of Brexit, but there are still uncertainties about future funding and the need for increased investment in capital infrastructure to remain competitive.",

The Cabinet Secretary highlighted the need to increase diversity in the teaching workforce and mentioned efforts to encourage career changers and part-time training options. The discussion concluded with the acknowledgement that teacher recruitment and retention is a global issue, not unique to Wales, and that further action is needed to address the challenges in this area.",

        "The decision to allocate $1 million in bonuses to the CEO of the Canada Infrastructure Bank instead of investing in essential infrastructure such as roads, schools, hospitals, and long-term care homes was likely based on the belief that rewarding the CEO would incentivize performance and attract top talent to the organization.

        "The Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams, acknowledged that there is room for improvement in the targeting of the pupil development grant (PDG). She stated that while individual interventions should only be targeted at children eligible for free school meals, schools may use PDG funding for universal interventions that have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals.

        "During the meeting, it was discussed that the major challenge faced during the transition of excluded students was the increase in challenging behavior and the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This created a strain on the capacity of schools and the education otherwise than at school (EOTAS) system, leading to more exclusions. To address this challenge, local authorities have developed behavior and well-being strategies, which include a tiered approach to provision and a focus on equipping staff with the necessary skills to meet the needs of students. However, there is still a lag in the system in terms of bringing all schools up to the same level of provision.\n\nIn terms of school accountability measures, it was suggested that they may have had an impact on the rise in exclusions. The pressure on schools to perform and meet certain performance measures, combined with the narrow focus on academic attainment, may have led to increased exclusions. However, it was noted that recent changes, such as the introduction of capped 9 measures, may help to improve the situation, but it is still early to determine the full impact.\n\nWhen it comes to support and reintegration strategies for students at risk of exclusion or disengagement, local authorities have clear strategies in place and employ a multi-agency approach. This includes working with social care and health colleagues to provide a holistic support package for students and their families. The majority of local authorities have clear strategies and engage in collaborative working to ensure a continuum of provision and support for learners. However, there may still be variations in provision and challenges related to capacity and funding.\n\nIn terms of access to mental health support, it was noted that there may be variations across different regions and health boards. However, there is a recognition of the need for improved mental health support for EOTAS learners. It was suggested that a whole-school approach to mental health and well-being, as well as training for teachers and staff, could help to address this issue.\n\nIn terms of the balance between funding for diagnosis and support, it was acknowledged that there needs to be a focus on both. Proper diagnosis can help schools understand a student's needs and provide appropriate support. However, it was also emphasized that support should not solely rely on diagnosis and that adequate support should be provided regardless of diagnosis.\n\nRegarding the awareness and impact of early trauma and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), it was noted that there is ongoing work on the ACEs agenda in schools. Some schools have become trauma-informed and are adapting their practices to take account of early trauma. However, there is still work to be done to ensure that the emotional and mental health well-being needs of vulnerable students are at the forefront of the curriculum and assessment.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the challenges faced during the transition of excluded students and the efforts being made to address these challenges. It was noted that there is still work to be done to ensure that all students have access to appropriate support and provision, and that their mental health and well-being needs are prioritized",
        "According to the annual report from Estyn, the education inspectorate in Wales, the quality of teaching in secondary schools remains a concern.

The report also notes that the regional consortia, which are responsible for driving school improvement, vary in their effectiveness. Some areas, particularly secondary schools and the support for digital competence, require more attention. The report also highlights the need for more support for schools causing concern, with a focus on improving teaching and learning. Funding is seen as a key factor in addressing these issues, with additional resources needed to support schools and provide training for teachers. The report also mentions the importance of the new curriculum in improving the quality of teaching and learning, and the need for schools to have time and support to prepare for its implementation.",
        "The major challenge faced during the transition of the excluded students was ensuring the continuity of education while also protecting the health and safety of staff and students.

The new purpose of schools will be to support those most in need, including key workers, children with additional learning needs, and those who benefit from free school meals. The specific details of how this support will be provided are still being developed in collaboration with local authorities and schools. The Welsh Government is working to ensure that all maintained schools have access to digital tools for distance learning through the Hwb digital learning platform. The decision to cancel the summer exam series was made to provide early certainty to students and staff, and further details on how grades will be awarded will be announced soon. The government is committed to protecting the well-being and education of all students and will continue to work together with schools and local authorities to address the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "The Welsh baccalaureate qualification is valued by learners and teachers. Many students have reported positive experiences and have gained valuable skills from studying for the qualification. However, there are also some concerns and criticisms raised by stakeholders. Some students and teachers have raised concerns about the workload associated with the qualification and the potential impact on student well-being. There is also variability in how the qualification is delivered, with some schools providing more support and enthusiasm for the qualification than others.\n\nTo address these issues, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams, highlighted several initiatives. The design group of Qualifications Wales is working to refine the qualification and address workload concerns. There are existing opportunities for professional learning and support for teachers delivering the qualification. The government is also working to better communicate the value of the qualification to employers and ensure greater consistency in its delivery.\n\nIn terms of the perceived lack of rigour and value of the qualification, Williams emphasized that the Welsh baccalaureate is a rigorous qualification that has been benchmarked against A-levels. It is recognized by universities and has a UCAS tariff associated with it. However, she acknowledged that there is a need to address concerns and misconceptions about the qualification, and to ensure that it is consistently delivered with the same level of rigour across all schools.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are criticisms and challenges associated with the Welsh baccalaureate qualification, the government is committed to addressing these issues and ensuring its value and consistency. The qualification is seen as an important part of providing a broad and balanced curriculum for Welsh students, and efforts are being made to improve understanding and engagement from learners, teachers, and employers.",
        "During the meeting, the Minister for Education discussed the major challenge faced during the transition of excluded students and how it was resolved. The challenge was related to the convenience of teachers rather than ensuring the best outcome for the students. The Minister shared a personal experience where her daughter wanted to reuse a project she had done previously, but the Welsh bac teacher did not allow it. The Minister emphasized the importance of using the individual project to gain value from the qualification and to use it in personal statements and interviews. She also mentioned that variation exists in the delivery of the qualification, but where it is being delivered well, such practices are not encouraged as they deprive students of valuable experiences. The Minister further discussed the perception of the Welsh baccalaureate among universities. She mentioned that Welsh universities accept the Welsh baccalaureate as an A-level equivalent, and it is deemed valuable for competitive courses like dentistry, medicine, and veterinary science. She also stated that Welsh universities, including Cardiff University, value the Welsh baccalaureate as part of a student's personal statement and interview process. The Minister expressed confidence in the Welsh baccalaureate and stated that Welsh students are not disadvantaged by taking this qualification. She mentioned her conversations with universities, including Cambridge and Oxford, where they expressed a high regard for the Welsh baccalaureate and its ability to develop the skills necessary for university-level work.",
        "The major challenge faced during the transition of the excluded students was the blurring of eligibility for the pupil development grant (PDG). The PDG was originally intended to target students eligible for free school meals, but it has been used more widely to support students from low-income backgrounds. The challenge was to ensure that the PDG was being used appropriately and effectively to improve educational outcomes for these students.\n\nTo resolve this challenge, the government has implemented several measures. They have appointed PDG regional advisers to provide strategic advice and support to schools in using the grant. They have also emphasized the importance of leadership in schools and the need for evidence-based interventions. The government is working with regional consortia to ensure that schools are using the PDG effectively and are able to demonstrate impact.\n\nIn terms of eligibility, the government has acknowledged that the current system of using free school meals as a proxy for need may not be perfect, but it is the best option available at the moment. They are exploring different ways to identify need, such as considering the impact of universal credit and working with the department in England to understand their thinking on eligibility. Any changes to eligibility would be subject to a full public consultation.\n\nIn terms of the practical use of the PDG, the government has found that the majority of schools are making well-thought-out and appropriate decisions. They have seen improvements in attendance and are working to address the differential between free school meal and non-free school meal students. The government is encouraging schools to focus on early intervention and evidence-based interventions to close the attainment gap. They are also considering greater flexibility in the use of the PDG and longer-term projections to better support schools in their planning.\n\nOverall, the government is committed to ensuring that the PDG is used effectively to improve educational outcomes for excluded students. They are actively working to address any challenges and improve the targeting and impact of the grant.",
        "During the meeting, the major challenge faced during the transition of excluded students was discussed. It was recognized that a multi-agency approach is needed to support these students, as their exclusions can often be a result of other issues in their lives. The committee discussed the work being done on mental health support and behavior support in schools, as well as changes made to the PDG for excluded students. Additional support is now being provided to these students that was not available before.\n\nIn terms of the impact of PDG on attainment, it was acknowledged that the attainment gap had widened in 2017. However, it was also noted that over the period of PDG implementation, there had been a narrowing of the gap. The committee discussed possible reasons for the widening of the gap, such as changes in exams and unintended consequences of literature. It was agreed that there is no one answer to why free-school-meal children were less resilient in the exam system last year and that further discussions and analysis are needed to understand the issue better.\n\nThe committee also discussed the role of exam boards in the lack of grade stability and the need to raise concerns with them. The Cabinet Secretary confirmed that she had written to Qualifications Wales and had asked them to submit evidence on the issue. She also mentioned that a deep dive into the subject would be conducted at the next ministerial policy board meeting.\n\nRegarding the transition of excluded students, the committee discussed the need for a multi-agency approach to support these students. It was noted that the PDG for excluded students is held at a regional level and that changes had been made to improve its effectiveness. The Cabinet Secretary mentioned that an external agency had been commissioned to evaluate the impact of the PDG for excluded students and that the report would be published later in the year.\n\nIn terms of the transition from Schools Challenge Cymru to the regional consortia, the committee discussed the effectiveness of the transition and the lessons learned from the program. The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged that there were mixed results from the program and that there were areas for improvement. She mentioned that the expertise from the program had been transferred to the regional consortia and that ongoing support was being provided to schools through the categorization system.\n\nThe committee also discussed the use of the PDG to track the progress of eligible students. The Cabinet Secretary emphasized the importance of tracking and acknowledged that there are different systems used by schools. She mentioned that the Welsh Government is considering the development of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda.\n\nOverall, the meeting provided valuable insights into the challenges faced during the transition of excluded students and the impact of the PDG on attainment. The committee discussed the need for a multi-agency approach, the importance of leadership, and the role of tracking progress. The Cabinet Secretary acknowledged the need for further analysis and improvements in the support provided to schools."
