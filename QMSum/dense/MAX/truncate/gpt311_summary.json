        "During the interactive evaluation, the User Interface and Industrial Designer disagreed on the price of the product. The User Interface believed that the product should be priced higher due to its trendy and fashionable design, while the Industrial Designer believed that the price should be lower due to the lack of technological innovation. This disagreement may stem from different perspectives on the value of design versus functionality.\n\nThe User Interface also disagreed on the redesign after the product evaluation. The User Interface felt that the product should be redesigned to be more user-friendly and intuitive, while the Industrial Designer believed that the current design was sufficient. This disagreement may be due to differing opinions on the importance of user experience and ease of use.\n\nThe User Interface suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance based on user requirements and hot trends. The User Interface believed that these colors would make the product visually appealing and trendy. This suggestion may also be influenced by the User Interface's understanding of user preferences and market trends.\n\nDuring the discussion of product appearance, the marketing team disagreed with the User Interface designer on the shape of the product. The marketing team believed that the product should have a more universal appeal and should not be limited to a specific target market. This disagreement may be due to the marketing team's focus on appealing to a wider range of customers and maximizing market potential."

        "During the evaluation of the entire production process, the team expressed their likes and dislikes. Some of the likes mentioned were the use of SMARTboard and laptops, which brought new ideas and made the process more interactive. The team also appreciated the opportunity to have control over the design and technological aspects of the remote control. They also enjoyed working with the digital pens and laptops, although some members mentioned struggling with the software. \n\nIn terms of dislikes, the team mentioned feeling restricted by the company's initial decision to only use a TV remote as a base. They felt that this limited their creativity and made it difficult to incorporate certain features, such as a cover with a cherry fruit on it. They also expressed concerns about the usability and intuitiveness of the remote control, particularly for left-handed individuals. Additionally, they mentioned the challenges of incorporating advanced features, such as speech recognition, and the need to consider the cost implications.\n\nOverall, the team seemed satisfied with their work and the final product, considering it a combination of technological innovation and fashion-forward design."

        "During the meeting, Kirsty Williams AM, the Minister for Education, discussed various topics related to higher education in Wales. In regards to the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, Williams stated that the act will be superseded by the new Post-Compulsory Education and Training Bill. She also acknowledged that the 2015 Act had both successes and weaknesses in fulfilling the government's objectives. One of the weaknesses was the potential limitation on institutions to fulfill national outcomes due to the emphasis on institutional autonomy. Williams emphasized the importance of maintaining institutional autonomy while also ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability.\n\nRegarding private providers, Williams stated that the Act currently requires regulated institutions to be charities, which excludes alternative private providers from regulation under the Act. Williams expressed her intention to continue with the charitable status requirement in the new legislation.\n\nWhen asked about the impact of the Act on part-time and postgraduate fees, Williams explained that the Act does not permit fee regulation for postgraduate courses, except for PGCE courses. She also stated that fee levels for part-time courses are currently not exceeding the amount of student support provided by the Welsh Government. However, Williams acknowledged the potential difficulties in introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses and stated that the Act precludes fee regulation in certain areas.\n\nIn terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, Williams highlighted the challenges faced by universities due to the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, uncertainty surrounding the Augar review in England, and Brexit. She mentioned that universities are taking out costs, which can impact their capacity to deliver for Wales. Williams also mentioned the decrease in EU student applications and the potential impact on research collaborations with EU partners.\n\nRegarding school improvement and raising standards, Williams discussed the use of the national evaluation and improvement resource, which aims to support self-evaluation and improvement in schools. She emphasized the importance of self-evaluation and the need to develop robust self-evaluation skills within the education system. Williams also acknowledged the challenges faced by local authorities in using their powers of intervention in schools and highlighted successful interventions in schools such as Sir Richard Gwyn Catholic High School and Ysgol Trefonnen.\n\nOverall, Williams expressed her commitment to continuous improvement in the education system and the importance of collaboration with stakeholders and organizations such as the OECD in achieving this goal."
