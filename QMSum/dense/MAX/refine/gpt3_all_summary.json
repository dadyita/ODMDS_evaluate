This disagreement may have been due to different perspectives on the cost of materials and production. The User Interface designer may have believed that the product could be sold at a higher price, while the Industrial Designer may have been more concerned about keeping the cost within budget.\n\nThe User Interface designer also disagreed on the redesign of the product after the evaluation. This may have been because they believed that the original design met the user requirements and market trends, and saw no need for significant changes. However, other team members may have felt that certain aspects of the design could be improved.\n\nThe User Interface designer suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance. This may have been based on the association of these colors with fruit, as the product was designed to resemble a banana. The User Interface designer may have believed that these colors would make the product more visually appealing and in line with current trends.\n\nDuring the discussion of product appearance, the marketing team disagreed with the User Interface designer on the shape of the product. While the User Interface designer saw the shape as unique and fashionable, the marketing team may have had concerns about its practicality and market appeal.
