    "During the meeting, the options discussed regarding the location of the recording equipment were not explicitly mentioned. However, there was a discussion about transcription options and decisions that needed to be made. The team mentioned using a tool called \"Transcriber\" from a French group, which has a user-friendly interface and allows for the transcription of audio to text. They also discussed the possibility of getting linguistics grad students and undergrads to do the transcription work, as well as the option of using commercial transcription services. It was mentioned that Jane had already done some transcription work, and they were considering different transcription conventions and the inclusion of additional information such as stress marking, repairs, and false starts. The team also discussed the possibility of integrating speech recognition technology into the transcription process, although it was acknowledged that the recognition quality might not be ideal.\n\nThe decision on how to proceed with transcription was not finalized in the meeting, but there was a suggestion to try an experiment with perfect boundary detection to see if it would make the transcription process easier. The team also mentioned the possibility of contacting the University of Washington to discuss transcription options and the distribution of the recorded data. Overall, the meeting focused on transcription options and the need to make decisions on how to proceed with the transcription process.\n\nAdditionally, several options were discussed regarding the location of the recording equipment. One option was to use an automatic boundary detection system based on volume on a specific channel. However, it was noted that this would only work for automatic boundaries and not for perfect human segmentation. Another option was to generate the segmentation manually and then have someone else transcribe the words and time themselves on it. This would provide an indication of whether it is worth spending time developing a tool to compute the segmentations automatically.\n\nIt was also mentioned that if a tool could handle speaker identification, it would be a major advantage. The cost of using an external transcription service was discussed, with estimates ranging from $28 to $32 per hour for technical documents. However, it was noted that these services may not be able to handle multiple channel data or provide speaker identification.\n\nThe decision was made to have graduate students transcribe the recordings, with a proposed payment rate of $8 to $10 per hour. It was suggested that the transcriptions could be done using the French software that was discussed in the meeting, which allows for multiple speakers. The script developed by the transcriber could convert the transcriptions into the format required by the software.\n\nThe transcription conventions were also discussed, including how to indicate speaker changes and handle backchannels. It was suggested to mark areas of silence as \"no speaker\" and use arrows to indicate the continuation of thoughts or conversations. The issue of ambiguity when multiple speakers are involved was acknowledged, but it was noted that this is less of a concern in meeting transcriptions.\n\nOverall, the decision was made to have graduate students transcribe the recordings using the French software and following the discussed transcription conventions. The use of an external transcription service was deemed less feasible due to",
