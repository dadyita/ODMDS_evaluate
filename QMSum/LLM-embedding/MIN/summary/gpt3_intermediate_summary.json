        "During the meeting, the User Interface, Industrial Designer, and Project Manager discussed the introduction and details of the prototype for a new remote control. The Industrial Designer suggested setting points to drive the project, and the User Interface asked if they received an email about it. The Project Manager confirmed that they had not yet sent an email but could do so if needed. The User Interface mentioned that they had received an email about the designs.\n\nThe Marketing team emphasized the importance of designing the remote control with originality, trendiness, and user-friendliness. The Industrial Designer mentioned that they had some confusion about their responsibilities but clarified that they would be responsible for the industrial design.\n\nThe Project Manager asked for a discussion on what needs to be done and the ideas for the design. The Industrial Designer mentioned that they wanted to create a new remote control for TV distribution and that it should not be very costly. The User Interface suggested the remote control having a function where users can list all the programs they want to watch instead of manually searching for channels. The Project Manager expressed concern about the cost if too much technology is included in the remote control. The Industrial Designer mentioned that choosing from a list of programs might require using navigation buttons. The Marketing team mentioned that the main function of a remote control is to have something in hand and suggested that if speech recognition is included, it may be better to have it in the TV itself.\n\nThe User Interface suggested having six or seven buttons for different categories and using the same buttons to choose among sorted programs. The Industrial Designer mentioned that navigating through channels or content on the TV screen using navigation buttons and the user interface would be an easy way to achieve this. The Project Manager agreed that this was a good idea and suggested displaying the navigation on the TV screen instead of the remote control. The User Interface and Industrial Designer agreed that this would be revolutionary and solve the issue of remote controls with too many buttons.\n\nThe User Interface mentioned that for the technical points, they would need to check how to gather data from programs or contents. The Marketing team suggested having a light adaptation system that adjusts the lights depending on the picture on the screen. The User Interface asked if they should have a conceptual remote control or just include the functions. The Project Manager agreed to discuss this further in the next meeting.\n\nIn summary, the prototype of the remote control was introduced during the meeting, with discussions focusing on its originality, trendiness, and user-friendliness. The main function of the remote control was determined to be the ability to choose content or channels, with suggestions for using navigation buttons and displaying the navigation on the TV screen. The technical aspects of gathering data and the possibility of including a light adaptation system were also discussed. Further discussions and information gathering were planned for the next meeting."

        "During the interactive evaluation, the User Interface and Industrial Designer disagreed on the price because the User Interface believed that the cost of having many buttons and advanced functions was too expensive. The Industrial Designer disagreed and felt that the advanced functions could be hidden and accessed through a small LCD screen and jog-dial. \n\nThe User Interface also disagreed on the redesign after product evaluation because they felt that the changes made to reduce costs compromised the original design goals and user requirements. \n\nThe User Interface suggested yellow and red as the basic colors for the product appearance because yellow was the company's color and red would make the power button more prominent. \n\nDuring the discussion of product appearance, the marketing team disagreed with the User Interface designer on the shape of the product. The marketing team wanted a more unique and stylized button grid, while the User Interface designer felt that the positioning of the buttons should be more familiar and intuitive for users.\n\nIn summary, the disagreements between the User Interface and Industrial Designer were mainly due to cost considerations and design compromises. The User Interface also had different opinions on the product appearance, colors, and shape compared to the marketing team. The meeting highlighted the challenges of balancing user requirements, cost constraints, and market trends in the design process."
