    "The discussion on resource implications for higher education institutions in Wales acknowledged several financial challenges, including a demographic dip, increased pension costs, and uncertainty due to the Augar review and Brexit. Welsh universities are facing a \u00a340 million funding difference compared to their counterparts in England. The Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) stated that while the challenges are significant, there is not currently a crisis in the sector, and universities are taking steps to balance their books, although this may result in job losses and reduced capacity. The Diamond reforms, which increase funding for higher education in Wales, are seen as crucial for the future of the sector.\n\nThe discussion also addressed the issue of university reserves. It was explained that while universities may have reserves, a significant portion of those reserves may be tied up in assets such as estates and not immediately available as liquid cash. The operating cash generated by universities is important for their financial sustainability and ability to meet costs. Concerns were raised about whether universities are effectively deploying their reserves for the benefit of students, and it was noted that universities have governance mechanisms in place to oversee their estates strategies and financing, with borrowing decisions requiring the consent of HEFCW.\n\nWhile there are significant challenges, there is currently no expectation of any higher education institutions in Wales facing financial stress or potential closures. HEFCW is closely monitoring their financial performance to protect the interests of students. Collaboration between higher education and further education is being encouraged, with specific funding provided by HEFCW to support collaborative activities and promote local provision within regions.\n\nMaintaining and increasing research funding was highlighted as important for the capacity and competitiveness of the Welsh research base. However, there have been no increases in QR funding over the past nine years due to financial constraints. Efforts are being made to increase support for research and innovation, including funding for innovation projects and improving access to funding from UK-wide research bodies. The potential impact of leaving the European Union on research funding was discussed, and efforts are being made to mitigate this impact through increased investment in research and improved collaboration with UK-wide research bodies.",

    "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector include a dip in the number of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, uncertainty due to the Augar review in England and Brexit. Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England. Despite these challenges, there is no crisis in the sector and institutions are managing the situation. However, there may be more costs being taken out, resulting in job losses and a reduction in capacity. Universities have reserves, but a large portion of it is tied up in their estates, making it less immediately available. They are also facing increasing costs in servicing their borrowings. Most universities have renegotiated their loan covenants due to changes in accounting standards. One university, the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, disclosed the need to renegotiate their financing arrangements. HEFCW has mechanisms in place to ensure institutions are managing their financial challenges and meeting their commitments to students. The rigour and consistency of governance arrangements across institutions are expected to be followed, with a need for continual refreshing of governing bodies. While tensions between executive teams and governing bodies may exist, the overall relationship is effective. There is a possibility of more institutions facing increased risk in the near future due to financial pressures. Part-time student numbers may not be sustainable, but significant fee increases for part-time students are not foreseen as it would not be acceptable to the market.",
    "Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, believes that Brexit has had a significant impact on Welsh higher education. He emphasized the importance of higher education to the Welsh economy, with universities contributing \u00a35 billion and 50,000 jobs annually. The potential loss of EU students, EU research funding, and structural funds poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of higher education providers in Wales. Dr. Blaney mentioned anecdotal evidence of difficulties in EU collaborative research activities and the need for greater investment in facilities to attract prospective students. He noted that the decrease in EU student applications to study in Wales may be due to changes in student support arrangements and the perceived state of repair of campuses. However, he highlighted the importance of maintaining the quality of the higher education system in Wales and the need for continued investment in research and innovation.\n\nDr. Blaney also emphasized the efforts of the sector to promote Wales as a safe and attractive place to study, as well as the importance of maintaining access to EU funding programs such as Erasmus+. He mentioned the need for clarity on the future relationship between the UK and EU in order to plan effectively and ensure the continued success of Welsh universities. In terms of funding, Dr. Blaney discussed the Diamond recommendations for higher education funding and student finance, and the need for transition funding to support the implementation of these recommendations. He also mentioned the potential impact of Brexit on attracting funding from UK research councils and charitable organizations, highlighting the importance of investment in research infrastructure and the ability to cover overhead costs.\n\nOverall, Dr. Blaney expressed concern about the uncertainties surrounding Brexit and the need for continued support and investment in the higher education sector in Wales.",

    "During the meeting, the discussion focused on the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them. Julie Morgan, a participant in the meeting, emphasized that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognizes that any physical punishment of children is incompatible with their human rights. She highlighted that the Bill aims to send a clear message that physical punishment is not acceptable and that there are alternative methods to discipline children.\n\nThere were concerns raised about the impact of the Bill on parents who use physical punishment as part of their parenting toolkit. Julie Morgan acknowledged that parenting is difficult but emphasized that there are already a range of other ways to support parents in raising their children. She also stated that the legislation is not expected to overwhelm social services or lead to a significant increase in workload.\n\nThe need for effective multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs) was also discussed, but it was stated that the effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on them. Close working between social services and the police is already established and will continue.\n\nConcerns were raised about the potential diversion of resources for social services and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). Julie Morgan expressed confidence that both social services and CAFCASS have the capacity to handle the workload and that ongoing monitoring and evaluation will help identify any issues.\n\nThe importance of investing in parenting support services and early intervention strategies was emphasized. Julie Morgan mentioned the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign and the need to update it to cover a wider age range. The discussion highlighted the need for a more coordinated and robust early intervention strategy.\n\nThe readiness of teachers for the legislation was discussed. Julie Morgan stated that the education sector is represented in the implementation group and that teachers would be included in the awareness campaign and training already provided for childcare issues.\n\nDuring the meeting, Karen Cornish mentioned that there were already procedures in place for teachers and other workforces to address issues related to HMRC, as they fall under safeguarding. She highlighted the importance of creating a whole-school approach to mental health and well-being and fostering an atmosphere where children feel comfortable bringing up any concerns with trusted staff members.\n\nJulie Morgan emphasized the need for a clear understanding of the new legislation and the importance of raising awareness about it. She mentioned the Healthy Child Wales program and health visitors play a crucial role in promoting positive parenting and that the removal of the defense in the Bill would allow them to do so more effectively. However, there were concerns raised about the accessibility of the program, especially in certain areas.\n\nThe participants addressed the impact of the legislation on teachers and the disclosure of non-conviction data. They stated that teachers are already expected to report instances of physical punishment and that the legislation would not change that. They mentioned that the disclosure of non-conviction data is a rigorous process and that only a small number of cases result in information being released during employment checks.\n\nRegarding the resourcing of the legislation, the participants acknowledged that there could be unknown costs but stated",
    "The WISERD research findings and concerns raised in the meeting regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system are summarized as follows:\n\n- Funding to improve educational outcomes for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds has improved over time, but there is still room for improvement in targeting specifically the underachievement of students eligible for free school meals.\n\n- Schools need to address the underachievement of more able and talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds by improving their identification and providing additional support.\n\n- The effectiveness of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) in improving outcomes for disadvantaged students has improved, but there is a need for more emphasis on community-focused initiatives and engagement with parents and the community.\n\n- Challenges faced by students from disadvantaged backgrounds include attendance issues and the impact of changes to performance measures. A more sustainable approach focusing on curriculum development, teaching quality, and long-term skill development is needed.\n\n- Looked-after and adopted children require specific attention, and efforts should be made to address their needs and engage with their families.\n\n- The effectiveness of the Schools Challenge Cymru program varied among schools, with some making significant improvements and others not. The program needs more time to properly evaluate its effectiveness.\n\n- Targeted funding and support for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, as well as a comprehensive and sustainable approach to improving outcomes, including community engagement, curriculum development, and teaching quality, are crucial.\n\n- The meeting also discussed various other aspects of the education system, including the shift in focus from literacy and numeracy to curriculum and pedagogy, challenges faced by different types of schools, the importance of self-evaluation processes, the performance of further education colleges, and the challenges faced by local authorities and consortia. Continuous improvement and collaboration within the education system were emphasized for better outcomes.",
    "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. In relation to the duty to promote public awareness, the Deputy Minister introduced amendments 1 and 4, which would require Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law and the prohibition of physical punishment. The Deputy Minister responded to amendments proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders, stating that they were unnecessary and added unnecessary provisions. The Deputy Minister also emphasized her commitment to a high-intensity awareness campaign over a six-year period.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2, which would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of the legislation. She explained that this provision would come into force the day after Royal Assent and that the post-implementation review of the Bill would be a continuous program of work. The Deputy Minister addressed an amendment that would require a report on the awareness-raising campaign to be prepared and laid before the Assembly before section 1 is commenced, arguing that it was unnecessary and in conflict with the need for certainty on the commencement date.\n\nDuring the discussion, Janet Finch-Saunders expressed support for additional requirements for the duty to promote public awareness. Suzy Davies raised concerns about the length of time for the post-implementation review and proposed amendments to specify the timeframe for reporting and to consult with the committee on the contents of the interim report. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian expressed support for the Deputy Minister's offer to provide an interim report and to consult with the committee on the issue.\n\nIn response, the Deputy Minister expressed willingness to consult and discuss with the committee on the contents of the interim report and training requirements. She also stated that the amendments proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders made little difference in practical effect. The Deputy Minister emphasized the importance of regular reporting of public attitudes and stated that all the areas raised by the amendments were relevant. She assured the members that the impacts of the Bill had been thoroughly considered before its introduction and that the costs associated with its implementation would be closely monitored. The Deputy Minister also highlighted ongoing engagement with stakeholders to ensure effective implementation of the legislation.\n\nIn response to concerns about potential consequences of the legislation, the Deputy Minister explained that the guidance and procedures of non-devolved bodies were outside the control of the Welsh Government. She argued against amendments that sought to delay the commencement of the Bill until certain conditions were met, emphasizing the importance of good working relationships with these bodies. The Deputy Minister urged the committee to reject the proposed amendments and assured them that the impacts of the legislation would be closely monitored."
