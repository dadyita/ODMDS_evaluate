    "Phd f: at the previous at last week's meeting, this meeting I was griping about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and Adam, and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data, since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us, phd a: Well, great. Then I was, talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area, sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where I was thinking about doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns, like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech, sort of raw cues from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting, or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to. postdoc e: And if people want to approach, i so I know e e You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group, professor d: - huh..",
    "User interface: We have a lot of different options for the remote control, but we're not sure what to do with it, so we're going to have to decide whether or not we want to use it as a remote control or not. Industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to have a button on the right side of the remote, but I don't know if it's practical to have it on the left side, or if it should be on the other side. user interface: It would be nice to be able to change the shape of the buttons, but it's not practical to do that. industrial designer: Yeah, it's a little bit awkward to have the buttons on either side, but if you put them on top of each other, it would make it easier for people to switch between them. User interface: I'm not sure if I want to change it or not, but the idea is to have two buttons on each side, and I think that's a really good idea. Industrial Designer: I agree with you, I think the idea of having two buttons would be interesting. User Interface: Yeah I agree, I agree. industrial Designer: That's a great idea, I like the idea, but there's no guarantee that it's going to work. Marketing: We'll see what we can do to make it work, and if it doesn't work, we'll just have to make a new one. Industrial Design: Okay, I'm sure we can figure out a way to get it working, and we'll figure out how much money we have to pay for it, but at the end of the day, it'll be a lot cheaper than the original price.. marketing: Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? project manager:. You know is there a card in th can we make a Card in the case, can we use it to charge it, or is there any other way to do it? User Interface User Interface Industrial Designer Industrial Designer User Interface Project Manager Industrial Designer Project Manager User Interface Marketing User Interface. to me the only additions to the remote would be the ability to adjust the volume, and the ability for the user interface to control the volume by pressing a button, and for the power button to turn on and off.",
    "The first petition is from a group of citizens who are concerned about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They are calling on the Government of Canada to take immediate action to address the crisis, and they are asking for the government to provide a plan to deal with the issue. They also want to ensure that the government is aware of the importance of the need for support for those affected by the pandemic and their families. The petitioners are also calling for the creation of a government-funded fund to provide assistance to those affected. The second petition is about the need to protect the environment, and the petitioners want to see the government take action to ensure the safety of the environment. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. The fourth and final petition deals with Bill S-204, a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. the chair: Thank you, Mr.Chair, and thank you for allowing me to take a moment to highlight an initiative that I started early on during the COVID crisis. The Heroes of Etobicoke-Lakeshore is an opportunity for citizens in my riding to recognize the contributions of those in their community who make life a bit easier. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out. I think of Daniel Lauzon who set up Food for Now, a mobile service that helps take care of the homeless. I also think of Toni Varone, who helped his business clients by forgiving their rents, or young Lucas, who wanted to thank his teachers.",
    "The industrial designer suggested that the design of the remote control should be based on the shape and feel of the device, with the idea that it should be easy to use and easy to hold, and that it shouldn't be too heavy or bulky. The industrial designer proposed that the remote should be shaped like an apple, and the project manager agreed, but the industrial designer was concerned that it would be difficult to find a way to incorporate the shape into the design. The project manager also suggested that it was important for the product to have a unique look and feel, with a unique shape and a unique feel, and it was decided that the logo should be in the shape of an apple. The marketing team agreed to incorporate it into the product, but they were concerned about the cost of the product due to the cost associated with it, and they wanted to make sure that the product would be affordable. They also wanted to ensure that there would be a variety of options for the color and shape of the control, as well as the size of the buttons, as they wanted it to fit into the budget of the project. marketing: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether or not we want to go with a different colour for the logo, or if we want it to be the same colour as the current logo, and then we need to decide on the size, shape, and color of the logo. We also need to figure out whether we want the logo on the front or the back, as it could be too big or too small, or whether it's too small or too big, and if it's the right size or not too small. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating the logo into the front of the design, but ultimately decided against it because they didn't want to overcomplicate the design too much, and also because they wanted the logo to be simple and not too complicated.",
    "Phd f: I think it would be a good idea to have a lot of people in the room because it would make it easier for people to understand what's going on and it would also be easier for them to understand how to interact with it. grad h: Right, which So I've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data and the TYSL tools are there're two sets, there's a back - end and a front - end, so the front- end is the user interface and the back - End is the indexing tool and the querying tool.. So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for conveniently you can now do Information retrieval on it, do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting, phd F: What what kind of what does that look like? The string that you type in. So the fact that it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it's probably gonna take me s significantly more than that to get IT to compile. professor b: And then does it play something back or that's something you're having to program?",
    "The team discussed the various options for the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that the project manager and industrial designer coming up with the idea of incorporating a push-button on the side of the remote, while the Marketing Expert suggested using a push button on the left-hand side. The Industrial Designer suggested that the buttons on the remote could be placed on the right side, and the Project Manager agreed. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating an LCD screen into the remote to display the user interface, as it would be easier for the user to see what's going on and easier for them to understand what's happening. The project manager also suggested incorporating a remote control with an LCD display, which would allow users to change the color of the screen to match their personal preferences. The Project Manager also suggested using an LCD for the buttons, as they could be easily visible from the front of the device. The industrial designer also suggested adding a microphone to the remote for voice recognition, which could be used to activate the remote by pressing a button, or by placing it in the middle of the display.",
    "meilyr rowlands: I think it's important to recognise that there is a lot of work to be done, and I think that we need to be careful not to over-focus on the number of children who are eligible for free school meals, but to focus on the proportion of those who are not eligible for meals, and to make sure that they have the support they need to meet their needs. However, we do recognise the need for more support for the more able and talented children, and we are working closely with schools to ensure that they are providing support to these children. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there are some differences in the way that schools are using the PDG, I would like to ask whether they are using it in a way that is consistent with the guidelines of the Welsh Government, and whether it is appropriate for schools to use it in this way, or whether it should be used in a different way. meilyr Rowlands: Yes, we've done that. claire morgan: Throughout our inspections, we are looking for best practice, because part of our strategy is always to identify where there are weaknesses, but actually to point schools in the direction of where they can find a solution. It was being spent on children who were underachievement, and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was often spent on boys than girls. I think, ultimately, all of these sorts of initiatives come down to strong leadership and effective leadership\u2014that they know how to organise and use those grants effectively. One of the shortcomings that we often identify is evaluation\u2014that money has been spent on a particular way of using the grant, but it has not been evaluated well. michelle brown am: And where schools work particularly hard to engage with Seren and take up opportunities from that and push as many pupils as appropriate to work with that, is that something that you would recognise within your inspection reports? And, on the other side, where schools don't do that, was that something you would pull them up on?",
    "The Project Manager suggested that the remote control should have a spongy texture on the outside, and the industrial designer suggested that it could be used as a remote control, as it would be easier to use than a regular remote control. The Project Manager also suggested incorporating a microphone into the remote, but the Industrial Designer argued that it would not be practical to incorporate a microphone, as there would be a lot of people who would want to use it. The Industrial Designer agreed that the microphone should be placed on the front of the remote and the Project Manager agreed that it should be on the back of the device, as this would make it easier for people to hold it in their hands. The project manager also suggested that there should be an LCD screen on the top, as the buttons could be easily accessible, and that the buttons should be easy to see and easy to find. The industrial designer proposed that the button should be located on the left-hand side of the screen, while the button on the right would be placed in the middle of the top-right corner of the display. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition system into the product, with the project manager stating that it was important for the remote to be able to recognize the voice of the user, as well as the user's voice, as they would have to interact with the remote for the user to understand what they were doing. industrial designer: And now we've we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some some kind of sort of bezzled logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the body of the product. user interface: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether or not we want to go with a different material for the buttons, or if we can use the same material for all of the buttons. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to use a plastic material, but we're not sure if it's going to be practical, but if it is, we'll have to find a way to incorporate it into the design. We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, and we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device? Industrial Designer: Well, we've got to make sure that it's not too hard to use, and we have to think about how to make it easy to use.",
    "Phd a: Well, I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed, but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker. And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth, or and even on prosody, which Don is gonna be working on soon, it adds this extra, you know, vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar. phd e: Is it because You you're saying the for dialogue purposes, so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes? Is that what you mean?",
    "User Interface: Okay, we have a lot of questions about the design of the remote control, and we need to make sure that it's not too complicated, but we have to be careful not to overcomplicate it. We have to think about the size and shape of the buttons, and it's important that the buttons are not too big or too small. We also need to be sure that we have enough room for all the buttons to work together, as well as enough buttons to be able to connect to different devices. User Interface: I think it would be a good idea to have two buttons, one on each side and one on the right side, so we can switch between them. The project manager agreed and agreed with the user interface that this would be the best way to achieve this goal. The user interface also suggested that the design should be based on the user's preferences, and the team agreed with this idea. The team also agreed that the project manager should be the lead designer for the project, as he is the only one who knows the most about the product, and that he should be in charge of all aspects of the project.",
    "The Industrial Designer and the Project Manager discussed the various options for the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting the idea of using a plastic case and a rubber case, while the User Interface team suggested using rubber instead of plastic for the buttons, and the project manager suggested using a combination of plastic and rubber for the power button. The Project Manager also suggested that the user interface team would be able to change the color of the remote to match the color scheme of the TV, as well as the shape and size of the buttons. The Industrial Designer also suggested incorporating a voice recognition feature into the remote, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice. The project manager also mentioned the possibility of using the remote as a remote control for the television, but the industrial designer emphasized the importance of having a simple design, as it would be easier for the user to use the remote without having to buy a new one. The industrial designer also mentioned that the remote could be used in a variety of different scenarios, including situations where the user would want to turn on the TV for a longer period of time, such as when they want to watch a TV for longer periods of time or when they need to leave the room for a few hours. Industrial designer: I think it's going to be interesting to see how people react to the remote and whether they like it or not.. user interface: No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about you know the the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here marketing:. industrial designer: that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it, it locks into place such that, you know, it's pretty permanent but at the same time, if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way marketing: Okay. project manager: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly, but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here, we've got this it's a solar cell thing right? industrial designer, we have to make sure that we have enough power supply for the battery, but we have a lot of different sizes of batteries, so we're going to have to decide whether or not to include more than one battery in the remote.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of using the remote control as a remote control, with the idea that it could be used to turn on and off by pressing a button on the remote, but it would be difficult to find a way to control it. The team also discussed the idea of incorporating a voice recognition chip into the remote to allow the user to control the remote with their voice, but they were not sure if they would be able to achieve that. The industrial designer suggested that the remote could be made of plastic or rubber, and the project manager suggested using rubber for the buttons, but the industrial designer was skeptical about the idea, considering the cost of the material and the difficulty of manufacturing it. However, the team decided to go with rubber, as it was cheaper and easier to produce than plastic, and it was easier for the team to use. They also decided to use rubber as the material for the power button, as they believed that the rubber would be more durable than plastic and would be easier to work with. The project manager also suggested using a plastic case for the remote as a base, as this would be the most cost-effective option, as well as a more durable material than the rubber case. The Industrial Designer suggested using plastic instead of rubber as it would make the remote more durable, and they also proposed using rubber instead of plastic for the batteries, as the rubber was more durable and less prone to wear and tear. The idea of using rubber was met with skepticism by the Industrial Designer, who believed that it would cost too much money to make a rubber case for a remote with a rubber cover, so they opted for a plastic cover instead.",
    "user interface: Okay, so we're going to have to find a way to make the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen look different, but we're not sure if it would be practical to have two buttons on it. industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to have a single button on the left and a double one on the right, but I don't know if it's practical to do that. user interface: I'm not sure about that, but it would make sense to have one button on each side of the screen, and the other two on the top and bottom. Industrial designer: Yeah, I think that would be a really good idea, and I think we could easily fit it in there, and it could be used as a power button or something like that. We could also use it to turn on and off, or we could use it as a volume control. Industrial Designer: It would be nice to be able to change the color of the display, and we could also change the size of the buttons to fit in the case, but that would cost a lot of money. User Interface: We're gonna have to make sure that it's not too big or too small, because we don't want to have too many buttons, but if we do, it would have to be a lot bigger than what we have now. industrial Designer: We'll have to decide whether or not we want to go with two buttons or three, and then we'll decide if we need to increase the number of buttons, or if we just need to add more buttons. We're also going to need to figure out what kind of buttons to include in the remote control, as well as how many buttons to add to the display. We'll also need to decide on a color for the buttons, as there's no way of knowing what color they'll be, as they're all different colors. We also discussed the possibility of using a different material for the LCD screen, with the idea of incorporating a spongy material, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost of materials and the need for a more durable material.",
    "User Interface: Okay, so we're going to start with the remote control, and we need to decide whether or not we want to include a power button or not, and then we have to decide if we want it to have a volume button on it or not. We also need to determine whether we want the remote to have different functions for different devices, like volume, volume, and power, or whether it should have different buttons for different types of remote controls, or if it should just have one button for volume and one for power. User Interface: I think it would be a good idea to have the power button on the right side of the remote, and the volume button would be on the left side, because it would make it easier for the user to find it. Marketing: We need to make sure that the remote is easy to use, and that it doesn't require a lot of effort to find, and it should be easy for people to find. The project manager agreed with the user interface team that it was important to have an easy-to-use remote control that would be easy to find and easy to understand, and they also agreed that it shouldn't be too complicated, as it would only take a few seconds to learn how to use it. The team agreed that a simple remote control would be the most effective, but they were concerned about the cost of the product, as they believed that it would take too much time to learn to use the remote. They also believed that the cost would be too high for a single-function remote control and that a multi-function one would be more cost-effective. The group decided to focus on a single function remote control for now, with the aim of making it more user-friendly and less complicated in the future.",
    "Phd e: I think it would be a good idea for us to try to find a way to reduce the amount of time it takes for the voice activity detector to be activated, because it is a very important part of the system, and if it is not activated, then it will be impossible to understand the speech. professor b: It would be interesting to see if there is any way to get around this problem, but I don't think there is a way, because there are a lot of things that could be done to solve it, and it would take a long time to do it. Because a all - pole model will still try to to put the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue is set to zero. because a all-pole model would still have to deal with this issue, and there is no way for them to do that because they would have to change the whole model. However, if they were to do this, they would lose the ability to analyze the data, because they wouldn't be able to see the difference between the input and output, and they would be unable to compare the input to the output.",
    "Phd b: I think it would be a good idea for us to try to reduce the latency of the system, but we have a lot of work to do to get it down to a more reasonable level. Professor c: So, for example, if we were to take a picture of a person's face, we would have to wait for them to look at it, but if they were able to see it, they would be able to recognize it. However, if they didn't, they wouldn't recognize it, and if they did, they'd have to go back to the beginning of the picture and try to find it again. Professor C: So it would take a long time to get to the end of the image, and it would cost a lot more money to get there. Professor D: So we'll have to find a way to minimize the amount of time it takes to get from one end to the other, and we can do that by adding a delay of a few milliseconds.. A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between, you know, a quarter of a second of latency and a hundred milliseconds, and I ''m not even sure if we can distinguish between a quarter and a half a second. professor c: Yeah, I think we can get there, but I think the latency is going to be a little bit higher than that. phd a: I'm not sure about that, but it could be a lot lower than that, because it would require a lot less time.",

The industrial designer suggested that the remote should have a voice recognition feature, and the team agreed that it was a good idea to incorporate it into the design of the remote. The team also discussed the possibility of using the remote as a speaker, with industrial designer saying that it could be used to play music, while user interface suggested that it should be used for voice recognition. The project manager suggested using a microphone for the voice recognition, while industrial designer emphasized the importance of having a microphone in the remote, as it would make it easier for people to understand what they were saying. Industrial designer also suggested incorporating a speaker for the microphone, but the idea was rejected by the team due to the cost of the microphone and the need for a separate microphone. The group agreed that the microphone should be placed on the right side of the device, with a microphone on the left and a speaker on the other, and they decided to include a speaker in the middle. They also decided to incorporate a microphone into the case, as they believed it would increase the chances of making the remote easier to find and easier to understand.",
    "The group discussed the possibility of incorporating a touch screen into the remote control, with the idea of using the touch screen as a way to interact with the remote, but the project manager expressed concerns about the cost and difficulty of implementing it due to the size of the device and the cost of materials needed to produce it. The team also discussed the feasibility of using a battery for the remote and the need for a rechargeable battery, but they were unable to come to a consensus on how to incorporate it into the design of the remote. They decided to go with a battery-powered remote control for now, as it would be more cost-effective and less expensive than a battery powered remote control. The project manager suggested that the remote should be able to charge on demand, while the user interface team suggested using a solar power supply to charge the battery, as they believed that the battery would last for a long period of time. The industrial designer suggested using rubber as a material for the case, as there is a lot of rubber in the market and it would make the remote more durable. However, the team decided to use rubber for the casing as it is more durable than other materials, as well as for the power supply. They also considered using a plastic case, but ultimately decided to focus on a rubber case as it was cheaper and easier to manufacture.",

Dr. Blaney believes that Brexit will have a negative impact on Welsh universities, with a significant impact on the number of students applying for higher education in Wales. However, he believes that there will be a positive impact for Welsh universities in the future, as they will be able to attract more students to Wales. He also believes that students from other European Union countries will be attracted to Wales, and that there is a need for a strong relationship between the UK and the EU. He believes that Wales will be the best place to study in the UK, as it is currently the only country in the world to have a higher education system with a higher number of EU students than the UK.",
    "Professor B: I think it would be a good idea to start with the German language, because it has a lot of similarities to the English language, and it's easier for us to understand it, and we can use it in the future. However, there are some differences between the German and English languages, so we'll have to decide whether or not to use them separately or combine them together. The German language is a little different from English, but it's not too different from the English one, so it shouldn't be too hard to translate it into English. Professor B: So, for example, if you were to say, \"I want to go to the cinema, I want to see a movie,\" and then go to a cinema, you could say \"I'm going to the movie theater,\" and it would make sense to have a movie theater in the middle of the city, because there are a lot more people in the city than there are in the country..

Industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to have a banana shaped case with a rubber material around it, as it would make it easier for the user to use, and it would look like a banana. User Interface designer: It would be interesting to see how the user interface would look and feel, as well as how it would work with the remote control. Industrial Designer: We have to make sure that it's not too complicated, and we need to make it easy to use and easy to understand. Marketing: We need to design the product in a way that is comfortable for the users, but not too hard to use. Project Manager: I don't know if we can do that, but I think we can make it simple, and I think that it will be easier to use than a traditional remote control. marketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about during the previous meetings. project manager: I'm not sure if it's going to work, but we have to see if it works, but if it does, we'll see if there is a market for it.",
    "grad c: and so we had a meeting on Friday talking about how to avoid that, and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject m to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those, and there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it it's getting more complicated. And so, the person can maybe make a mental note that \" ah yeah I wanted to go shopping here \" and \"I wanted to maybe take a picture of that \" and \u201c maybe eat here \u201d, and then they can decide if they want to do that or not. grad c: And we want to make sure that they are aware of what they are doing and what they're doing, and we want them to be able to recognize the difference between the two.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, addressed the concerns raised by the committee regarding the need for a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of the change in the law, stating that it was important for the public to be aware of the implications of the law change. She also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public understands the impact of the Bill and the need to ensure that it is implemented in a way that is consistent with the Welsh Government's objectives. However, the Deputy Minister emphasized that the Bill was not intended to create a new criminal offence, and that it should not be seen as a new offence, but rather as a change to the existing law. The Deputy Minister also highlighted that the bill was not meant to create any new criminal offences, but to provide an opportunity for the government to address the issue of parental consent and ensure that parents are not penalised for failing to comply with the new law. In response to the concerns of the committee, the Minister for Children and Families raised concerns about the lack of transparency in the Bill, particularly in relation to the implementation of the legislation, and suggested that the government should consult with the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill, which is currently being debated in the Scottish Parliament, to determine whether it is appropriate for the Bill to be implemented in Wales. The Minister for Education and Skills agreed with the committee on this issue, and agreed that it would be appropriate to consult with both the Scottish and Welsh Governments before implementing the Bill. I believe that the Scottish Government has the right to regulate the Bill in accordance with the Scottish Bill, and I am confident that they will be able to do so in line with the requirements of the Scottish bill. Furthermore, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment. I think we always need to bear in mind that what the Bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence. And in this context, it doesn't make sense for this Bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished. As I set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point, safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business, and, as now, the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child. I wish to speak to amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the duty to promote awareness, as well as amendments 1B and 1C. I don't think it's necessary for the Government to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, as is suggested in amendments 1C, but I do believe that it's important that the awareness campaign be comprehensive, well planned, well-organized, and well-coordinated, and reach out to all those people and all those communities, and understand how to respond to it.",
    "The WJEC does provide what's required in a regulatory sense, and there are two things there\u2014the specification, which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching, and also exemplar assessments, which include marking, and those go to the regulator before they are published. The WJec also do invest a great deal in resources that we produce digitally in both languages simultaneously. Each new course has substantial teaching guidance, which includes a lot of useful information for teachers and pupils. And we run a professional development programme for teachers that is free of charge when courses are new, and then annually there is some charge for those events. Indeed, the regulations as they stand in Wales, Northern Ireland and England preclude examination bodies from having commercial links with providers of textbooks. So, that is one point that we noted as something that needs to be considered for Wales as we move forward, whether it would be possible\u2014. As we are not talking about examination boards competing with each other in Wales for GCSE and A-levels, in passing, that was something that I would want to suggest may deserve review. At the moment, these tend to be England-based\u2014Hodder Education and Illuminate Education, for example\u2014and then the Welsh Government does provide funding to the Welsh-language versions for those textbooks. Philip Blaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, and Emyr George, associate director general qualifications, discussed the role of commercial publishers to provide textbooks. Now, that's something that needed to be looked at in the future, as there was a need for different models for how that might be achieved and also, potentially, around a paradigm shift in what's expected of those materials.",
    "Hefin david am: So, let's start with the early years, because we know that there's a lot of work to be done when it comes to the provision of early years services in Wales, and we need to make sure that we have a system in place to ensure that children have the best possible start in life, and that they have the support they need at the start of their life. julie morgan am: Absolutely, because it's important for parents to have a good start in their children's lives, and it's also important for children to have the opportunity to learn from their parents, so it's really important for them to be involved in their child's education and to be able to support them in their early years. So, we're working closely with the local authorities and working with them to understand how they can best support children in their first few years of life. And, of course, we want to support parents in their time of need, but we also want them to know that we're there for them, and they can come to us for support. sian gwenllian am: And you've just said you want to simplify that, particularly with regard to the availability of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen? jo-anne daniels: We're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it's absolutely right, it is a very complex system because it has grown up from all different routes. We have got pathway projects in eight local authorities, including Swansea, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, and Swansea, who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support families too and support the home. So that can also help with the development of the children, so, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer discussed the cost of the remote control, with the industrial designer stating that they would have to spend a lot of money to make it cost-effective, while the marketing team emphasized the importance of having a cost-efficient design. The industrial designer suggested using a plastic case for the remote, and the project manager agreed, noting that it would be cheaper than using a metal case. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition chip into the remote for voice recognition, which would allow users to control the volume, volume, and volume control, as well as the ability to control volume with the voice recognition system. The project manager also suggested that the remote should be able to be used in a variety of situations, such as when the remote is turned on and off, or when it's turned off and on again. However, the team agreed that it was important to include a microphone in the case, as it would reduce the cost and increase the user's chances of being able to use the remote. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to have a microphone on the front of the case because it will be easier for people to find it, and it's easier for them to see it. Marketing: Okay, so we're going to have to make sure that it's not too expensive, because it's going to cost a lot, but we can afford it. industrial designer: Yeah, it's okay, I think we can do that, but it's gonna cost a little bit more than we originally thought, but I think the cost will be less than we thought. marketing: We'll have to decide whether or not to include the microphone, but if we don't, we can just add it to the back of the box. Industrial Designer: We're not going to put it in the box, because we're not sure if it will fit in there or not, but the idea is to have it on the back, so it can be placed on the side of the device, so that it doesn't get in the way.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of using the PDA as a way to reduce the amount of time it takes for the signal to travel through the room, with the goal of reducing the time needed to reach the center of the room. However, they were unable to find a good way to do this, as it would require a lot of time to process the data. The team also discussed the feasibility of using a low-pass filter, as this would allow for a more accurate signal to be sent to the microphone, as well as the ability to adjust the frequency of the signal. The group also discussed how to address the issue of reverberation, as there was a concern that it would be difficult to determine whether or not the noise was coming from the microphone or from the air conditioner, and the team agreed that it was important to address this issue.",
    "The group discussed the need for a universal remote control, with the user interface team suggesting that the remote control should be able to control a wide range of devices, including TVs, televisions, and DVD players, while the marketing team suggested that it should be more user-friendly, and the project manager agreed that it would be easier for people to use the remote than a traditional remote control. The group also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition feature into the remote, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice, as well as the ability to change the volume, volume, and volume of the remote. The project manager also suggested that the team should consider incorporating a remote control with voice recognition, as it would make it easier for users to switch between channels, and that it could be used for both TV and DVD playback. The marketing team also suggested the addition of a remote with a microphone, as they believed that the voice recognition could be a useful feature in the future. The team also proposed the inclusion of voice recognition in the remote as a way to interact with the TV, and they also suggested incorporating a microphone for voice recognition into the device. The user interface group also suggested adding a microphone to the remote so that users could ask for the channel and volume information, and it was decided that a microphone should be placed on the front of the device to make the remote easier to find and easier to use.",

    "meilyr rowlands: I think that there are different situations in different schools, but in the best schools, they evaluate the barriers to learning for their particular children. In Brackla Primary School, in Bridgend, they've had an extensive strategy for engaging with the community, with the families, and equipping their children to participate in decisions around the curriculum, making them more confident learners. Cefn Hengoed in Swansea, which I'm sure many of you know about, have an extensive Strategy for engagement with families, equipping them with the tools they need to make their children more confident and more capable, and they have a range of activities to engage with families. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. You referred to the fact that it is used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable. It was being spent on children who were underachievement, and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children when they were eligible for Free School meals, because those numbers are equal. So, we think that schools are perhaps not following that exactly, but within the spirit of the grant, I think I\u2019m fairly comfortable. There is a specific question\u2014I don't know if you are going to ask this\u2014regarding more able and talented pupils. I think what we've found is that the most effective schools\u2014the ones that really do make a big difference to this cohort of students\u2014are the ones that do that most effectively. claire morgan: I was in a conference for headteachers last week, where there was new data being discussed, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests, but I think the data will be very useful, because what that data can do is help secondary schools to identify more able children and that they are underachieving.",
    "user interface: We need to find a way to make the remote control user-friendly, but we need to make sure that it's easy to use and that it doesn't require a lot of effort to use, so we're going to have to think about how to make it easier to use. industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to have a button on the right side of the remote to control the volume, and I think that it would make sense to have it on the left side, because it's easier for the user to see what's going on, and it would also be easier for them to understand what they're doing. Industrial designer: It would be nice to be able to adjust the volume automatically, but I don't think it's practical to do that right now, so I think the best way to achieve that would be to use the remote as a remote control, but it could also be used to turn on the television and turn off the television, or it could be used as a power button to change channels, or as a volume control to change the channel, or even as a light switch to turn the volume up and down, depending on the needs of the user.. But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use, making sure that, you know, something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remotes as something like a microphone, and that the buttons are placed in a way that doesn't interfere with the user's ability to control their television, and also that they're easy to reach and easy to find, and they're not too hard to reach, so there's no reason why they shouldn't be accessible to the user, but there's also no need to be too hard on the user if they don't want to use it, but if they do want to, they can easily find it, and if they want to try it, they just have to press a button and it'll turn on and off, or they can turn it off and on and on again..",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to recognise that there's a lot of work to be done to ensure that the PDG is being used in a way that meets the needs of all children, and we need to make sure that we have a good understanding of how it's being used. We need to be aware of the impact of PDG on individual children, but we also need to understand the impact on the whole system, so that we can be sure that it's effective and effective. So, we have to be mindful of the importance of ensuring that we do not lose sight of the fact that there are children who are eligible for free school meals, and that they are not only eligible for meals, but they are also eligible for PDG. I think that the focus needs to be on ensuring that they have the support they need to achieve their goals, and I think there is a need for more support for them. llyr gruffydd am: And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think the guidance is sufficient as it is? Kirsty, are you confident that it will be effective in achieving the goals that you've set for the coalface, and do you believe that there is enough evidence to demonstrate that it is effective? kirsty Willams am: Yes, I think we have an excellent understanding of the need and the need to address it, and it's something that we're working on, and there are a number of things that we are looking at, including how to improve it.",

One of the things I was, I was trying to think about what what's the best way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts one was, that spectrogram that we show is O K, but the thing is the eyes and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns from from noise that in first glance you look at them it doesn't seem like it's that bad because there's many features that are still preserved.. So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different, an and blow it up, and have that be the part that's just to show as well. Another, I think, was taking some spectral slices, like like we look at with the recognizer, and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there, and the other side of the spectrum, and the only difference is that we have to change the amount of time it takes to get from zero to twenty milliseconds to twenty-five milliseconds. phd f: We have to be careful not to overdo it, because if we use too much time, we'll lose the signal, but if we don't, we won't have enough time to fix it.",

The team also discussed the need for a remote control that is easy to use and easy to find, and the idea of using a wheel for the wheel was discussed. The Industrial Designer proposed a simple remote control with a push button, but the project manager suggested that the wheel could be replaced with a wheel, as it would be easier for the user to find it. The project manager also suggested the addition of a voice recognition chip to the remote, which would allow users to control it with their voice. The user interface suggested using a button on the left side of the screen to control volume, and they also suggested a light on the right side, which could be used to turn on and off the remote. The industrial designer also suggested adding a button for volume and a volume button to turn off the volume, but they were both rejected by the user interface due to the cost and complexity of the device. The User Interface team proposed a new design for the remote that would be more user-friendly, with a simple look and feel, and it was agreed upon by the team.",
    "The project manager suggested that the remote control should have a spongy texture on the outside, which would make it easier to use, as well as the ability to change the color and shape of the buttons, and that it should be able to be used in different shapes and sizes. The industrial designer agreed, and the project manager agreed that it would be a good idea to have a variety of colors and patterns on the front and back of the remote, as it would allow users to choose from a wide range of colours and shapes. The project manager also suggested that it could be used as a remote control, as long as it was easy to find and easy to use. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition system into the remote as well, with the idea of using voice recognition to activate the remote by pressing a button, but the team ultimately decided against it, as they felt that it was too complicated to incorporate it into a simple remote control. They also decided to focus on the design of the device, considering the cost of the product and the need for a simple design that would be easy to produce. The Industrial Designer suggested using a plastic material for the cover, which was considered by the team to be the most cost-effective option, while the Project Manager agreed with the Industrial Designer's suggestion of using rubber for the buttons and the User Interface suggested using plastic for the screen.

    "The first petition is from a group of citizens who are concerned about the lack of adequate funding for the construction of a sports centre in Oro-Medonte. They are calling on the Government of Canada to provide funding for this project, as they believe that it would be beneficial to the community. They also want to see the government provide additional funding for a new sports centre to be built in the area. They believe that this would be a good idea, as it would provide a much-needed boost to the local economy. The group also wants the government to ensure that there are adequate funds available for the project. The second petition is about the need for a government-funded sports centre, as there is a lack of funding for sports in the province. The government should provide funding to build a sports center for this purpose. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. The fourth and final petition deals with Bill S-204, a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S204 and of similar bills in previous parliaments and would like to see us pass that bill as soon as possible. These residents have signed a petition asking the government of Canada, and in fact all members of Parliament, to put a high priority on assisting our poorest seniors. The increases to the GIS by $200, and $300 to the OAS, have been well received. They just want to highlight how important it is to support our seniors, in particular the poorest of our seniors. the chair: Thank you very much, Mr. I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out.

    "The remote control has a lot of buttons on it, but it's hard to find a way to control it, and it's difficult to use it because it's too hard to hold it in one hand, and the buttons are too small, and there are too many buttons, and they're not easy to reach, and you have to press them all at once, which is not ideal for people who have to hold them all the time. However, oh, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part, then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, because there are no restrictions on physical size, or shape, it it could be as fancy as you want to be, you know,it could be like a lollipop or something like that, something weird like that., will people will people be willing to wait for the period that it'll take to train the remote, 'cause I think it will the remote will get better over time with the same user user, but for the first week or for the next two weeks are you willing to have a bad remote control, and what if you have visitors come round, they stay the night, they wanna use the T_V_, they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you, they'll have to use a different remote control for each channel, but they'll be able to use the same remote control., and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to incorporate a voice recognition system in a remote control considering the new project requirements.",

    "user interface: But we don't know if it's going to be easy to use, but I think it would be fun to have a voice recognition feature, and I think the user interface would like to be able to control it with their voice. industrial designer: Yeah, I think that's a good idea, but we need to make sure that it's not too hard to learn, because it would take a lot of time to learn. Industrial designer: I don't think it's too hard, but it's definitely not easy to learn it, and it's important for the user to be familiar with it. user interface: It's not about the content, it's about okay, is it easy to f Yeah, definitely. user Interface: Yeah, but that's the that of the basic idea of the the speaker industrial designer, and the User Interface designer agreed that the voice recognition function would be a good addition to the remote control, but they didn't want to compromise on the quality of the product. They also agreed that it was not necessary to change the shape of the case, as it was already in place, and they could easily adjust the shape to suit the user's preference. The Industrial Designer suggested using a plastic case, but the Project Manager suggested using rubber instead of rubber, as the project manager believed that the rubber would be more durable. The User Interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer on the idea of using plastic, as they believed that it would make it easier for users to adjust the volume and volume, and that it could be used in the future. The Project Manager agreed with User Interface on the decision to use rubber, and User Interface agreed with Industrial Designer's suggestion of using rubber for the buttons, as he believed that they would be easier to use than the rubber case.",
    "meilyr rowlands: I think that there is a lot of work to be done, and we have a lot to do, but I think it's important to recognise that we need to be careful not to lose sight of the fact that there are many different types of children who are eligible for free school meals, and it is important to identify those who are not eligible, and to ensure that they receive the support they need. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there's some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. I think what we've found is that the most effective schools\u2014the ones that really do make a big difference to this cohort of students\u2014are the ones that do that most effectively. In terms of what schools are doing with the grant, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they're trying to work with families and the community in general, and they're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy. I was in a conference for headteachers last week, where there was new data being discussed, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests, and the data showed that there was a significant improvement in the performance of children in the first six months of the school year. So, we look at the relative performance of different groups, including boys and girls, free and non-free, ethnic minorities and ethnic minorities, but we also look at performance of more able pupils in particular. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, and I think we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meal meals, but it has not been evaluated well. However, we do feel that schools are using the PDG effectively. One of the shortcomings that we often identify is evaluation, because part of our strategy is always to identify where there are weaknesses, but actually to point schools in the direction of where they can find a solution.",
    "User Interface: Okay, so we're going to start with the remote control, and we're gonna have to decide whether or not we want to include a power button on it or not, and then we need to decide if we want it to have a volume button or not. marketing: We need to find a way to make it easier for people to find the remote, but we're not sure how to do it. user interface: We're gonna need to make sure that it's not too complicated, because we don't want to have too many buttons on it, but it needs to be easy to find and easy to use. Marketing: We want to create a remote control that's easy to pick up and use, but not too hard to lose, and it's also not too difficult to use, so it can be easily lost or broken. We also need to be able to adjust the volume and volume of the remote to suit the user's preference, and the remote needs to have the ability to change the channel, volume, and power button. We're also going to have to consider the size and shape of the buttons, as well as the shape and size of the power button, to ensure that it doesn't get in the way of people's hands when they're trying to use the remote. The project manager suggested that the remote should be shaped like the shape of a triangle, with the power and volume buttons on the left and the volume button on the right, and with the channel and power buttons in the middle. User Interface: I think it would be a good idea to include the volume, as it would make the remote easier to find, and I think that it would also be useful for people who have a lot of different types of remote controls.",
    "User Interface: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether or not to go with a different color for the buttons, but we're not sure if we want to use a different colour for the red apple, or if we can use the same colour for all the buttons. Industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to use different colors for the different buttons, and I think that it would make a lot of sense to have a variety of colors for different shapes and sizes. Marketing: So we'll have to make sure that it's not too different from the other buttons, as it would cost too much money to change the color of the buttons. marketing: That's the pr project manager: Right, so as far as the the finance of the batteries are concerned, we need to find a way to reduce the cost of the power supply, and we're gonna have to reduce it by one point. industrial designer: Yeah, I think we can do that, but I don't know if it's possible to do that. marketing: I'm not sure how much money we have to spend on the battery, but it's probably not too much, so I'll see if I can find it.. I think you just do one, don't you, for the project manager, is that meant to be all sixteen buttons, and therefore, what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons, but just to have the one that was soft and spongy, and therefore marketing said that it was okay to have only one, whereas the others would have to be hard plastic, and industrial designer said that they would only have one, and marketing said they'd have to choose between two colors, with one being red and one being blue, and the other being orange. Industrial Designer: Okay, I think the idea is to make it look and feel like an apple, and then have a bunch of buttons on it, and it's gonna look like a red apple and have a number of different colors on it.",
    "dafydd evans: I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college. sian gwenllian am: So, do we get rid of it?",
    "The group discussed the importance of having a remote control that was easy to use, with the idea that it would be easier to use than a traditional remote control, and the team agreed that it was important to have a simple design that could be easily accessible and easy to handle. They also agreed that the remote control should be easy to hold, and that it should be able to be used in a variety of ways, such as using the remote to turn on the TV, play music, or turn off the TV. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a speaker into the remote, which would allow the user to control the remote with their voice, as well as the ability to control it with their hands. However, the team decided to focus on the idea of making the remote more user-friendly, as they believed that the device would be more comfortable to hold than a regular remote control. The group also agreed on the need for a more ergonomic remote control and suggested that it could be made out of plastic or rubber, as it would make it easier for people to hold it in their hands and not have to lift it off the table. The project manager also suggested that the project manager should be the lead designer, as he was the only person with the most experience with the project, and he would be the one who would have the most input into the design of the product. The marketing team agreed with this idea, but the industrial designer expressed concern about the cost of the device, as the cost would be too high for a device of this size and complexity. The industrial designer suggested using rubber instead of rubber for the buttons, and suggested using plastic for the power and volume buttons, while the marketing team suggested using a rubber case for the volume and volume control, which was agreed upon by the group.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating speech recognition into the remote control, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost of developing a speech recognition system, as it would not be cost-effective. They also decided to focus on a simple design, with the idea that the remote would be easy to use and simple to use. The team also discussed the idea of incorporating a remote control with an LCD screen, which would allow users to control the remote by pressing buttons on the screen, but they decided against this idea because it would be too expensive. The industrial designer suggested that the project manager and the marketing team would be responsible for the design of the remote, as they were responsible for deciding on the price of the product. The project manager also suggested using an LCD display, but the industrial designer rejected this idea, believing that it was too expensive, and the team decided to go with a simpler design instead.",
    "The group discussed the concept of a banana-shaped case with a banana shaped case, with a rubber material for the battery and a rubber case for the power supply, as well as the idea of using the banana as a base for the device. They also discussed the need for a simple and easy-to-use user interface, and the need to find a way to make it easy to use. The team discussed the cost of the product, with the project manager stating that the cost would be less than the average cost of a smartphone. The group agreed that the product should be simple and affordable, and that it should be able to be used in a variety of environments. The project manager also suggested that the user interface should be easy to understand and easy to navigate, as it would be easier for the user to use than a phone with a complex user interface. The industrial designer proposed that the case should be made of rubber, and suggested that it be shaped like a banana and have a banana shape. The user interface would have to be flexible enough to adapt to different shapes and sizes, but not too flexible to be too bulky. The marketing team agreed to include the banana shape in the design of the case, as they believed that it would appeal to a wide range of users. The Industrial Designer proposed a simple design with a simple look and feel, but the Project Manager disagreed, stating that it was too complicated. The Project Manager agreed with the Industrial Designer's assessment that the banana case should not be too heavy, as the rubber material would be too hard to handle, and he suggested using rubber instead of rubber for the case.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of adding a remote control with an LCD screen to the remote control, but the project manager explained that the LCD screen was already available and that it would be too expensive, so they would have to find a way to incorporate it into the design of the remote. The team also discussed the idea of incorporating a button to control the remote, but they were unable to come to an agreement on how to do it. The project manager suggested that the remote should be simple and simple, and the team agreed that it should be easy to use, with a simple design and a simple price point. They also agreed that a simple remote control would be a good choice for the average user, as they would not have to spend a lot of money to buy a new remote control. However, they were not sure if they would be able to reach the target market, as it was unclear whether they would need to spend more money on the remote or if they needed to invest more money in the design. They decided to focus on making a simple and stylish remote control that would appeal to a wide range of people, with the aim of appealing to a younger audience. The remote control should have a simple look and simple functions, but it should not be too complicated, as the user interface team was concerned about the cost of the product, as well as the need for a more complex design. The marketing team suggested that they could make the remote with more features, such as the ability to change the channel and volume, while the industrial designer suggested adding a button for volume control and a volume button for the volume. The industrial designer also suggested adding an LED light, which would be useful for dimming the lights in the room, and a light button for turning on and off, which could be used to turn on or off the TV.",
    "Phd a: Well, I had a just a quick question but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed, but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker.. And the reason here is just that for the people doing work not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth, or and even on prosody, which Don is gonna be working on soon, it adds this extra, you know, vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar. phd e: Is it because You you're saying the for dialogue purposes, so that means that the transcribers are having trouble with those mikes? Is that what you mean?",
    "The Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams, agreed with the Minister for Health, Steve Davies, that there was a need for a comprehensive response to the coronavirus pandemic, with a focus on supporting vulnerable children and young people. Kirsty also highlighted the importance of ensuring the safety of children and their families, as well as ensuring the health and safety of the wider community, and highlighted the need for the government to work closely with local authorities and schools to ensure the safety and well-being of children. The Minister acknowledged the challenges faced by secondary schools, and the need to ensure a safe environment for children, with Kirsty stating that the government was working closely with schools and local authorities to ensure that they were prepared for the challenges posed by the pandemic. The Ministry of Education has been working with the Ministry of Health and the Welsh Government to develop a plan for the next two weeks, with the aim of ensuring a safe and secure environment for all children, including those who have been affected by the virus, and ensuring that they have the support they need to recover and recover from the virus. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas? kirsty williams am: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, as we have compared it to a snow day. Hefin david am: A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus and we understand that that is the case across Government.",
    "The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control could be used as a remote control, as it would be easier for people to use than a traditional television, and that it could be placed on a flat surface, allowing users to control it with the touch of a button. The Industrial Designer also suggested that it should be able to be used in a variety of situations, such as in the dark or in a dark room, and it could also be used to turn on and off by pressing a button on the side of the remote. The industrial designer also suggested the idea of using a special case for the remote, similar to the one used in the iPod, which would allow users to use it as a handheld remote control. However, the Industrial Designer expressed concerns about the cost of the device, as they would have to pay for a new case, as well as a new power supply and a new battery for the battery, which could be costly. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a battery in the case, but the industrial designer believed that it would cost too much money to add a battery to the case and that the case would be too small to fit into the case. The idea of a battery was also discussed, with the Industrial Design team believing that the battery should be small enough to fit comfortably in a purse or purse, while the Project Manager believed that a battery should not be too bulky, as the case should be relatively small and easy to handle. The Project Manager also suggested using a battery as a power source, as there is no need for a separate battery for this type of device, and the battery could be easily stored in a pocket or purse for easy access. We have a number of different choices for a design concept and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of, but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work, industrial designer: user interface: how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device.. The case, the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do, there's there's the shape of a case, we could do a flat sh a flat case, a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case. I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet, just keep that in mind, but these are the options we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic, the m the main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titanium, rubber or other coloured types of plastic. then if you want to do anything more advanced, you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want. The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the Dark or whatever, you can work out which button's which and basically, yeah it's ith it's fun.",
    "Kirsty williams am: Well, we have a lot of work to do in relation to the impact of Brexit on the sector, and we have been working closely with the HE and FE sector, as well as the wider sector, to understand the potential impact of the Brexit process, and to ensure that they are prepared for it. However, we are aware that there are a number of challenges facing the sector in terms of their ability to adapt to the changes that are going to take place. So, we're working with the Ministry of Education and the Welsh Government to understand how they can be prepared for these challenges. We are also working with universities and colleges to ensure they are adequately prepared for the challenges that they face. We have been in contact with the Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams, who is responsible for higher education and further education in Wales, and they have been providing support and guidance to the sector.

The government is committed to ensuring the safety of Canadians and their families, and they are working hard to ensure that they have access to the necessary resources to ensure their safety and well-being. Additionally, the government is working closely with the provinces and territories to establish a national standard of care for the care of the most vulnerable in our society. They are also working with the federal government and the provinces to develop a national strategy for the future of the health care system. They also call on the government to prioritize the creation of a national health insurance program for Canadians who have lost their jobs due to lack of access to health care.

We want it to have a lot of buttons, but not too many buttons, so it doesn't have to be too complicated. We also need to be able to adjust the volume and volume of the remote, and the power button is going to be the most important button, because it's the only button that's going to change the volume, and that's what we need for the remote to work properly. We're also going to have to decide whether or not to include a power button on the remote and whether it should be on the left or the right side of the device, or if it should only be on one side or the left side. The team also discussed the possibility of using the remote as a stand-alone device, with the idea that it could be placed on a shelf in the living room or in the kitchen. The project manager suggested that the remote could be used to control the television, but the user interface suggested that it should not be used for TV sets, as it would be too difficult to find the remote. The group agreed that it was important to design the remote with a simple design, and they decided to focus on making it simple and simple, with only a few buttons on the front and a few on the back.",

The Industrial Designer suggested that the remote should be able to change channels, and the project manager agreed, noting that it would be important for the team to have the ability to adjust the volume, volume, and power of the remote, as well as the size and shape of the buttons. They also discussed the possibility of using the remote to control the TV, as it could be used to turn the TV on and off, and it could also be used as a way to change the volume of the TV. The industrial designer also suggested the idea of having the remote in a different color, as they could easily change the color of the channel if they needed to. The project manager also mentioned that the team would need to design the remote with a different look and feel depending on the user's preference, and they would have to make sure that it was ergonomic and comfortable to hold.

The project manager also suggested that there should be a button in the middle for the volume, as well as a power button and a volume button, but the team agreed that there was no need for either. They also agreed that the button should be placed in the center of the device, as it would make it easier for users to find the remote. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to have two buttons on either side of the screen, so that it's easy to see, and we can easily switch between them. industrial designer: It would be nice if there were buttons on both sides, but I don't think there's a need for that. marketing: Okay, so we're going to have to decide whether or not it's necessary to have buttons on each side, but we're not sure if it's practical to have them on the same side, or if they should be on opposite sides. Industrial Designer: I'm not sure about that, but it's probably not a bad idea, as long as it doesn't interfere with the other buttons. industrial Designer: Yeah, I agree with the idea of having two buttons for volume and volume control, but there's no need to have too many buttons, as they're not going to be used all the time.",
    "The team discussed the possibility of using the DAT to create a voice-recognition system that would be able to identify the location of the microphone, as well as the ability to determine whether the microphone was on or off based on the direction of the speaker. The team also discussed the importance of having a voice recognition system in place, as it would allow them to understand the context of the conversation, and it would be easier to understand what the person was saying and what they were trying to say. They also considered the feasibility of using a speech recognition system, as they were able to determine that the voice recognition would be more accurate than a speech synthesizer, and they were confident that it would not be difficult to use speech recognition. They were also confident that they could identify the presence of a microphone in the room, as there was no need for a separate microphone to be placed in the center of the room. They hypothesized that the microphone could be placed on the left or right side of the person's face, and that it could be used to locate the microphone. The group also considered using a voice synthesizer to determine the position of the microphones, as this would be the most accurate way to determine where the microphone should be placed. However, the team realized that it was not practical to place the microphone on the right side, as the microphone would be too close to the mouth, which would result in the person having to hold the microphone in their mouth. To address this issue, they decided to place it in the middle of the table, where it was easier for the person to hold it in their hand.",
    "The group discussed the possibility of incorporating a push button into the remote control, with the idea that it would be easier for the user to control the remote by pressing the button, and the idea of having a button on the right side of the remote to turn it on and off. The team also discussed the feasibility of using the wheel as a remote control for the wheel, as it could be used to turn the remote on or off, and it could also be used as a power button to turn off the TV. However, the team decided to keep the wheel for now, as they believed that the wheel would be more convenient and less expensive than the push button. The project manager also mentioned that the project manager was concerned about the cost of the wheel sensor, as he felt that the cost would be too high. The group agreed that they would need to find a way to incorporate the wheel in the remote, and they decided to incorporate it into the design of the device. The industrial designer suggested that the remote could be placed in a plastic case, similar to the ones used in TVs, and that the buttons would be placed on the left and right sides of the screen. The user interface suggested using a rubber case for the buttons, but the industrial designer rejected the idea, stating that the rubber case would be difficult to find and that it was too expensive. The idea of using rubber was rejected by the user interface team, who suggested using plastic instead of rubber, as the rubber would be harder to find in the dark. The Industrial Designer suggested using rubber instead of plastic for the button and suggested using the same material for the power button and the volume control. The Project Manager agreed with the Industrial Designer's suggestion, noting that the plastic case would make it easier to find, as well as making it easier for users to find the buttons. The User Interface team also suggested incorporating a light on the remote for easy access, but they were unable to come to an agreement on the amount of time it would take to produce the necessary parts, as there were too many parts to fit in the case.",

I think that it is important for the Bill to be inclusive, but it is also important for it to be clear, so that people can understand the impact of the Bill and understand the implications of it. We need to ensure that we have a clear understanding of what is considered appropriate and appropriate for children, and it is vital that we are clear about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. We know that there is a need for clarity in the Bill in terms of the definition of appropriate punishment, but we also need to be sure that it does not lead to unnecessary harm to children. We also know that children are more likely to be affected by the Bill than adults, and the Bill needs to be consistent with the principles of the Convention on the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011, which recognises the importance of respecting the rights of children and young people. The Bill also needs to address the issue of the right to bodily autonomy, which has been raised by the Commissioner for Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru and the Police Service.",
    "user interface: We need a power source, we're gonna need a smart chip if we're going to make it multi-functional, and we need to make sure that it has enough power to power all the remote controls, so that it doesn't lose power when it's turned off. marketing: We're gonna have to think about how to make the remote control more user-friendly, and I think it's important to have a power button on the right side of the remote so that people can see it and not have to hold it in their hands. user interface: It's important for people to be able to see it, and it's also important for them to know how to use it, so they don't have to look at the remote and try to find the power button, and they can just press it and it will turn on and off automatically. marketing: But also s so the channel, the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used, but those are the definitely the top ones. And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers, so even though we need a small number of buttons, we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player, a TiVo, what what exactly are we using it to do, as well as the age range. user Interface: marketing: And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it, and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it. project manager: And then lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include, and how simple, complex it should be?, what are needed to complete insulation process, 'cause, you know, that's something that also has to be considered. and we have to be sure that we have enough power supply to power the remote, and that it's not going to lose power in the middle of the night.",
    "Janet Finch-Saunders AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, and Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government, discussed the need for a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from the date of Royal Assent. They also highlighted the importance of ensuring that the public are aware of the change in the law and the need to raise awareness of the implications of the law change. However, they expressed concern about the lack of clarity in the draft Bill, with the Deputy Minister stating that it would be difficult for the public to understand the meaning of the new law. The Deputy Minister emphasized that the Bill was not intended to create a new offence, but rather to change the existing law. They emphasized that it was important for the Welsh Government to ensure that the awareness campaign was well-planned, well-organized, and well-conducted, and that the campaign would focus on the impact of the Bill on children and their families.",
    "Bethan owen: I think there are a number of factors that are contributing to the decrease in the number of applications, but I think one of the most important factors is that there is a lack of clarity about the impact of Brexit on Welsh universities, and we need to be careful not to overstate the impact. There is a lot of uncertainty in terms of the impact that Brexit will have on the future of the Welsh higher education sector, and it's important to make sure that we have a plan in place to deal with that uncertainty. However, it's also important to recognise that there are other factors that could play a role, such as the need to ensure a smooth transition to the next stage of the Brexit process, as well as the importance of a smooth Brexit for Wales, and the need for the Welsh government to ensure that the Welsh universities have the support they need to meet the needs of their students. Additionally, it is important to note that there has been a significant increase in the amount of interest from international students in Wales, who are seeking to study in Wales. We are beginning to see some increase in applications from students from outside the EU, but we have not seen a significant decrease in applications to Wales, so it's not clear whether this is related to Brexit or not. We can't say for sure, but it's possible that it's related to the uncertainty around Brexit and the uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the rest of the EU. We're not going to speculate too much on that, but there's a lot to be gained from the research and teaching grant, and I think it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming years. We'll have to wait and see what happens.",

I just want to start by asking about your perception of how schools are using the pupil development grant funding, and to what extent they are genuinely targeting that funding exclusively towards children eligible for free school meals. Estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant, and, really, going back to before this specific grant, to a similar grant, called RAISE. At the start of this grant, the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement, rather than dealing with the underachieving of children who are eligible for school meals specifically. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, and I think we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meal meals. In terms of what schools are doing with the funding, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things they are doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they're trying to work with families and the community in general, and they're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy.",
    "The group discussed the cost of the product, with the project manager stating that they would have to find a way to make the product more affordable, and the industrial designer stating that it would not be possible to sell the product for less than five Euros. They also discussed the possibility of using rubber as a material for the case, as it would be more durable than plastic. The team agreed that a rubber material would be a good choice for the product as it could be used in a variety of situations. The industrial designer suggested that the product should be made of rubber, and that the user interface should be simple and easy to use. The project manager agreed with the idea of using a rubber case for the battery, but the team decided to use rubber instead of plastic, as the rubber material was more durable and would be easier to handle. The group also agreed on the need for a user interface that is easy to understand, as well as the need to be able to change the shape of the case to fit into different shapes and sizes. The Industrial Designer proposed that the case should be shaped like a banana, with a banana-shaped case and a banana shaped case. The Project Manager agreed with this idea, and agreed to include a banana shape in the case. However, the Industrial Designer pointed out that the banana shape would not fit into the budget, as a banana would be too small and the case would be hard to hold. The User Interface team agreed to incorporate a banana into the case and suggested that it should be covered in rubber, which was agreed upon by the team.",

    "The team discussed the possibility of incorporating a speech recognition feature into the remote control, with the Project Manager stating that it would require a more advanced circuit board, and the Industrial Designer stating that the team would have to decide whether or not to include it in the final design of the remote. The Project Manager also mentioned that they would need to find a way to integrate the speech recognition into the device, as it would be difficult to incorporate it into a standard remote control. The Industrial Designer also mentioned the need for a more expensive circuit board for the remote, which would require the addition of an advanced chip, but the team decided to focus on a simple circuit board instead. The team also discussed the idea of incorporating speech recognition in the remote as a feature, but ultimately decided against it due to the cost and complexity of the project manager's opinion. The project manager also suggested that the user interface should be able to control the remote by pressing a button on the left or right side of the screen, while the industrial designer emphasized the importance of having a simple button on both sides of the display, as they would be easier to find and easier to use. The industrial designer also suggested incorporating a push button for the left side, which was met with some skepticism from the User Interface team, who believed that the button should be placed on the right side, as this would be the only way to activate the remote without having to press a button. However, the team ultimately decided to go with the push button, as there was no need to worry about the cost, as the button would be easy to find, and it would allow the user to simply press the button on either side to activate it. The user interface team also suggested using a rubber case for the buttons, but they were unable to determine the cost of the rubber case, so they decided to use a plastic case instead. Industrial Designer: I think it's a good idea to use plastic, but I don't know if it's going to be practical, but we'll have to see what the cost is and decide whether it's worth investing in it.. user interface: But the way that I interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly, it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than project manager: So if we go for a simple push button, so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we? industrial designer: I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost, but it didn't work out too well, so maybe in sort of quick summary of the last meeting, I can quickly give you what we what we had. We're gonna have effectively two pages, a front page which had the features that the the customers most wanted, and then the the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements.",
    "The group discussed the cost of the remote control, with the project manager stating that it would be expensive to produce a device that cost more than the average person's monthly income, and the team agreed that the cost would need to be reduced. They also discussed the importance of having a user-friendly remote control that would be easy to use, with a simple design that could be easily accessible, as well as having the ability to change the volume, volume, and power of the device. The team discussed the possibility of adding a speaker to the remote, but the idea was rejected by the team, as they believed that the speaker would be too bulky and bulky, and they were concerned about the cost and the need for a speaker that was too bulky. The group agreed that a speaker with a speaker was the best choice, as it could be used in a variety of different shapes and sizes, and it would allow users to control the device with their hands. The project manager suggested that the device could be made of plastic or rubber, and that it should be able to adapt to different sizes and shapes. The industrial designer suggested that it be made with a rubber material, as there was a possibility of using rubber in the case, but it would cost too much money. The marketing team suggested using a plastic material for the case and the industrial designer proposed using rubber for the buttons, but they were unable to find a material that was strong enough to withstand the weight of the case. They decided to go with rubber, which would be more durable than rubber, but not as durable as rubber. The Industrial Designer suggested using rubber instead of rubber, as the rubber would be easier to handle, and there would be less risk of wear and tear on the material. The user interface team agreed with the Industrial Designer's assessment that it was a good idea to use rubber as a material, but there was no guarantee that the rubber material would be durable enough to last for a long period of time.",

It was being spent on children who were underachievement, and one of the things we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children with disabilities, because those numbers are equal.

The team also discussed the feasibility of integrating a remote control with a screen, as it would be easier for the user to understand what's going on, as they would be able to see what's happening on the screen. However, the team decided to focus on a single-curved remote control that could be used for different purposes, such as controlling the volume, adjusting volume, and adjusting the volume of the remote. The industrial designer suggested that the user interface should be simple, with a single button on the right side of the screen, and that the buttons should be easy to read and easy to find. The remote control should have a simple and simple design, with buttons on the left and right sides, and it should not be too complicated, as the user would have to press a button to activate it. The idea is to have a small button on one side and a larger button on another, so that it's easier to see and easier to reach. The user interface team also considered the possibility to incorporate a voice-activated remote control into the remote, but they decided against this because they believed that it would not be practical. They decided to go with a simple remote control instead, with the idea that it could be easily accessible to the user, but it would require a lot of time and effort. They also decided to include a small remote control in the package, as there was no need for it to be expensive.

I I did not receive any information on that, but I think the competition, sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important, because there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to, but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate, you know, so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a a small tray. marketing: Now the early adopters, those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to to pay for it, the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities, ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control.",

Phd e: I agree with Professor C that there is a lot to be said about this, and I think that it's important to be careful not to overdo it, but it's also important to keep in mind that there are other things to consider, such as whether the speaker is speaking to the speaker or not, or whether they are speaking to each other or not speaking to one another, or if they are talking to one speaker and not to the other..

So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth? julie morgan am: Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we're working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things. sian gwenllian am: And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014? jo-anne daniels: Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded. lynne neagle am: I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day.

    "The User Interface team agreed that the remote control should be able to control the TV, but they were concerned about the cost of the device due to the fact that it would have to be sold separately from the other remote controls, as well as the possibility of having to buy a new remote control. The team decided to focus on the design of the remote, with the aim of making it more user-friendly and easier to use. However, the team realized that they would need to include a remote control with an LCD screen to display the TV channel, and they decided to use an LCD display instead of a traditional TV screen. They also decided to incorporate a voice recognition feature, which would allow the user to speak to the remote by pressing a button on the screen. The remote control was also designed to interact with the television, and the user interface team believed that it was a good idea to have a small remote control, as it would be easy to find and easy to use, and it would allow users to easily change channels and channels. The project manager agreed with the idea of using the LCD screen, but the team also realized that there was a need for a more advanced remote control that would be more user friendly, as they wanted to avoid the need to change channels on the TV. They decided to go with a screen-based remote control instead of an LCD, as this would be easier for users to find the channel. The industrial designer agreed with this idea, as he believed that the LCD would be a better choice than a traditional television screen, as the LCD could be used to display different channels, and that it could be easily changed by simply pressing buttons on the display.",
    "Phd b: We have a lot of work to do on the neural net, and we have to figure out how to make it more efficient, but we have some ideas on how to do it. Professor c: I think it would be a good idea to try to reduce the amount of time it takes for the neural network to process the input data, and I think we can do that by using a combination of different filters, but it would take a long time to get it up and running. Professor C: So, for example, if you were to take a picture of a person's face, you could see that they were wearing a hat, but if you took a picture, they would look like they had a hat on their head, and if you looked at the picture, you would see that their hair looked like it was on fire.. A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between, you know, a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds, and I ''m not even sure if we can distinguish between a quarter and a half a second.., basically if you yeah, if you said, \" what's the, what's the, the shortest route to the opera? \" and it took a second to get back to you, phd a: Yeah.",

There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel, so all those buttons that you don\u2019t really use unless you're programming or something.. industrial designer: Well there are loads of different types of dogs, so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog.., I like dogs because, they're so good to humans, like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs, and they're just such friendly animals..",

And so, the idea was to have the group of people in the group talk to each other on the phone, and the group would be able to identify the person who was speaking to them, and then they would have a conversation with the person they were speaking to, and they would know who they were talking to and what they were saying to them. The group agreed that this was a good idea because it would be easier for them to understand what the person was saying, and it would allow them to be more accurate in their speech.",
    "The Industrial Designer and Project Manager discussed the importance of incorporating voice recognition into the remote control, with the Industrial Designer stating that it was important for the remote to be easy to use and easy to understand, while the Project Manager agreed that it would be important for users to be able to control the remote with their voice. The Industrial Designer also suggested that the remote should be simple to use, as it should be easy for the user to find, and the project manager agreed to incorporate a voice recognition chip in the remote, which would allow users to control it by pressing a button. The Project Manager also suggested using a speech recognition chip for voice recognition, which was agreed upon by the industrial designer and industrial designer. The project manager also mentioned the need for a new chip for the voice recognition feature, as the current generation of remote controls don't have it, and they were unable to find a way to incorporate it into the existing remote control. The industrial designer agreed that the new chip would be more powerful than the current remote control and that it could be used in a variety of scenarios, such as playing music, changing channels, and controlling the volume, as well as using voice recognition. The team also discussed the possibility of incorporating a voice-activated remote control into the device, as there are currently no voice recognition chips on the market, but they were unsure about the feasibility of incorporating it into a remote control for children, as they were concerned about the cost and the difficulty of implementing it in a child-friendly device. Industrial designer: I think it's a good idea to incorporate voice recognition in the device as it would make it easier for children to learn how to use it. Industrial Designer: I agree with this idea, but I don't know if it's practical to incorporate this feature into a standard remote control as it's not practical for children. I'm not sure if it will be practical for kids, but if it is, I think we should consider incorporating it in the future.. I su i if given that the the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before, th th the double risk, perhaps we ought to stick to to buttons, since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work. project manager: do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project? industrial designer: it's fundament well I guess it it's something we've discussed since the the sort of the beginning, so I th I think in in our in our heads it's fundamental, but we need to make sure that it doesn't interfere with the rest of the functions of the remote., but I think there's a lot of work to be done to make it work, so we'll have to figure out the best way to do it..",

User Interface: I think we should have a button for volume, and I think that would be the best way to control the volume. user Interface: It would be nice to have the volume and the power button on one side, and the volume button would be on the other side, but it would also be fun to have two buttons on the same side for volume and for power. We're also going to have to decide if we want the volume to go up or down, and if it's going to be louder or lower, or if it should be louder, or whether it should just be lower.

    "The main elements of remote controls in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip and the battery. We have a number of different choices for a design concept and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of, but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work, industrial designer: user interface: how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device.. We want people to be able to use it s as a remote control, so we have to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are, and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to have a lot of features. We have to find a way to incorporate all of these features into a single device, but we have a hard time coming up with the right combination of materials, so we're going to use a combination of different materials to achieve that goal. We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials, but that's sort of what I have in mind. The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever, you can work out which button's which and basically, yeah it's ith it's fun. So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often. So, you have buttons for your favourite channel, changing the volume, which is something you do all the time when you're viewing T_TV_, and the button to switch it off, in case you get bored. other features, things like adjusting the brightness, tuning the T-V, I don't know what else you do with a T-TV, but I do know that you can adjust the brightness, and I think it would be a good idea to do that.",

Professor d: So, for example, for instance, we have a system where we have the same amount of data, but it's not the same as the other system, and it's different from the one that we have for the Danish system. However, there is a difference between the other two systems in terms of the amount of time it takes to process the data, and the difference in the quality of the data is different for each system. Professor D: We have to take into account the fact that they have different types of data and the different ways of processing it, so we need to adjust the data to match the different kinds of data. But we also have to consider whether or not it's a good idea to change the data or not, because it would be a waste of time to do it all at once. Professor C: I don't know if it would make sense to do that, but if it were to do so, I think that it would probably be a better idea. But if it wasn't, then it wouldn't be worth it.. But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things, a again within the constraint of the resources, if there's something simple that you can do Now for instance, it's, I think, very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal's side and then for the server ''s side say, \" Here's a number of things that could be done. \" So, everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did, and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them, too.",

I think it's important to recognise that there is a need for more support for more able children, and we are working hard to ensure that they receive the support that they need. llyr gruffydd am: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there's some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. You referred to the fact that it is used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable. It was being spent on children who were underachievement, and one of the things we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children with disabilities, because those numbers are equal. So, I think the focus needs to be on ensuring that the funding is spent in a way that maximises the impact of the grant for the most disadvantaged children. However, we also need to recognise the need for schools to engage with the wider community, and I think they are doing a very good job of doing that. In terms of what schools are doing with the PDG, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things they're doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they've got Families at Brackla, and it's a range of activities to engage families, and the schools are working to address some of those concerns. Cefn Hengoed in Swansea, which I'm sure many of you know about, have had an extensive strategy for engaging with the community, with the families and equipping their children to participate in decisions around the curriculum, making them more confident learners. They're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent to improve the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy.",
    "The Industrial Designer proposed the idea of a remote control that could be used to control the remote control, and the Project Manager agreed with the idea, stating that it would be easier for the user to find the channel they want, as it would not be necessary to search for the channel. The Industrial Designer also suggested that the remote should be easy to use, as the user interface would be able to navigate to the channel, while the project manager agreed with this idea. The User Interface team agreed to design a new remote control for the TV remote control and suggested that it should be simple to use and easy to change channels. The Project Manager proposed that the design should be user-friendly, with a simple look and feel, but the Industrial Designer agreed that it was not necessary to include a lot of buttons, as there would be no need for buttons on the remote. The project manager also suggested the inclusion of a speech recognition system in the remote, which would allow users to control their TV with their voice, as they would not have to hold the remote in their hand. However, the User Interface Team agreed that this would be difficult to achieve due to the size of the remote and the cost of the device. Industrial Designer suggested the use of a voice recognition system, which was met with skepticism by the Marketing team, but User Interface agreed to include it in the next meeting.",
    "The Industrial Designer and Project Manager discussed the importance of having a remote control that was easy to use and easy to find, as well as the need for a user-friendly design, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that the remote control should be shaped like a potato, while the Project Manager suggested that the user interface should be able to change the shape of the remote to fit in the user's hand. The Industrial Designer also suggested that it should be easy for the user to find the remote, as it would be easier for them to hold it in their hands. The Project Manager also suggested the idea of making the remote more ergonomic, and the User Interface team agreed that it was a good idea to have a button on the right side of the device, as the buttons would be easy to reach. The team also discussed the possibility of adding a volume button to the remote as well, but the industrial designer believed that it would take too much time and money to make it fit into the device. The project manager also suggested using a special button for the volume button, as he believed that the button would be too small to fit comfortably in the hand, and it would make it difficult for people to find it.",
    "The petitioners are calling for the Government of Canada to take immediate action to address the issue of sexual exploitation and human trafficking in Canada. They are asking the government to support amendments to amend the definition of the definition to ensure that the definition is correct and doesn't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into. The third petition is regarding Bill S-204, a bill in the Senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent, dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in China. There is no known scientific technology to clean up the bitumen when there is a spill, and the number of tankers would go from eight to 34 per month into the Burrard Inlet. I want to remind all members in the House that when presenting a petition, the idea is to be as concise as possible. The petitioners note the pandemic is having a devastating impact on many Canadians nationwide, especially those who have low to modest income, small business gig workers, freelancers, artists, film industry workers, non-salaried workers and individuals on fixed incomes such as seniors and those on disability. It further notes that rent, mortgage and utility payments are due at the end of each month, putting countless Canadians at risk of losing their housing. They've made sacrifices and gone above and beyond to make the lives of their neighbours better and to keep our communities safe. It would be impossible to list everyone who has emerged as a community hero, but I'd like to highlight a few, like Lily, an eight-year-old from Elgin who raised funds for her local food bank by building and selling squirrel picnic tables, and Louise Boardman from Spencerville who's making masks for long-term care facilities and selling others in support of the Breast Cancer Action centre. It is the people of LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes that make it so great. Chair, the Indian Act enshrined racism into Canadian law in 1876, and, through residential schools, the child welfare system, our legal system and our police, we criminalized and tore apart indigenous peoples. The deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi and the assault on Chief Allan Adam are recent examples of systemic racism within the RCMP. Anti-black racism has resulted in more young black men being jailed, children being streamed or excluded from schools and negative police interaction due to profiling. It's now time to reimagine and rework our institutions, starting with our police. andranne larouche (shefford, bq): Thank you, Mr.Chair. The first petition reflects the outrage of my constituents at the ever-expanding order in council from the government banning more and more firearms. I'm here to present two petitions containing hundreds of signatures on the issues of the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the People's Republic of China, particularly the practice that's alleged of involuntary organ harvesting. The second petition is from residents throughout SaanichGulf Islands concerned about what was, at the time this petition was submitted, a future problem. It remains an issue, and I present it on behalf of petitioners who wish the government of Canada not to put public funds into purchasing or maintaining the Trans Mountain pipeline or towards any expansion of the pipeline. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificate off at the table once the petition is presented.",
    "Phd b: I think it would be a good idea to have the transcribers go through the whole meeting, but I don't know if they would be able to get through it all in one sitting, or if they'd have to do it in groups of two or three, but if they were able to do that, they would have a better chance of getting through it. professor c: Can we pipeline it so that say there's, the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we you run it through this other other stuff?, grad e: Well the other stuff is I B I'm just thinking that from a data keeping - track - of - the - data point of view, it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to sending them bits and pieces. professor C: Yes except that if they had if there was a choice between having fifteen minutes that was fully the way you wanted it, and having a whole meeting that didn't get at what you wanted for them It's just dependent on whether we're willing to use Robustness?",
    "User Interface: Okay, so we're going to have two buttons on the left and right sides of the remote control, one on the right side, and the other on the bottom, and we're gonna have a button on each side for volume and volume control. industrial designer: I think it would be a good idea to have a different color for the buttons, but we're not sure if it's practical to have them all in the same color. Industrial designer: It would be nice to have more than one color, but it would cost a lot of money to make them all look the same, so I think we should go with just one color. user interface: I'm not sure how much money we have to spend, but I'm sure we can find a way to do it for less money.. We're at sixteen point eight and marketing: how - how are we going to achieve this high-end product if project manager: Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro, marketing: We only have very sparse project Manager: So let me see, what are we marketing: Two point three? Industrial Designer: Three and a half. industrial Designer: Because when you do something on the T_V, the T-V_ responds and reacts as well, marketing: industrial designer could be looking at the screen and pushing his thing so we may not need to User Interface: That's fair enough, yeah. industrial Interface: so when we scroll we need just some way to get the L_C_D_ panel to respond, Marketing: Industrial designer, we need to make sure that we have enough buttons for the volume and the power button, and then we'll have to add a button for volume, but the project manager wants to make it bigger, so they can be placed in the middle of the screen. Industrial Designer, Industrial Designer and User Interface have agreed on the idea of having a single button on the top of the display, but they want to include a second button on either side of it.",
    "dafydd evans: I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college. sian gwenllian am: Kay, is that your experience? kay martin: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications. But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want their apprentice to be literate, numerate, and have digital skills.",
    "user interface: so in the different stages of the design, so at first I will be responsible for for yeah, designing the technical functions of the of the remote control then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to come up with interface concept and then during the final stage I will need to design the user interface. industrial designer: I think it's going to be interesting to see how people interact with the remote and how they interact with it.. project manager: and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way, so that by the end of the day we came up with a great product.. Okay, cool, I am the Marketing Expert so like I'm gonna to be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design, trend watching in industrial design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design project manager, industrial designer, project manager and industrial designer. Industrial designer: Okay, I'm the Industrial Designer, and I'm responsible for the design of the product. marketing: Marketing is the Marketing Manager, Industrial Designer is the Industrial Design Manager, Project Manager is the Project Manager, User Interface is the User Interface, and Industrial Design is responsible for User Interface. Industrial Designer: I'm a User Interface Designer, I like to work with computers and I have a lot of experience with computers, but I have to learn how to use them. industrial Designer: Yeah, I know, it's hard to use a computer, but it's really fun to use it. Marketing: Marketing, we're going to have to find a way to make it easier for people to use this remote control, but we're not sure how to do it. Industrial Design: We have to think about how we can make it easy to use, and we have to make sure it's not too complicated.",
    "The Project Manager explained that the remote control needs to be able to be used in different scenarios, such as when a remote control is turned on and off, when the remote is turned off and on again, and when it's turned off, and that it needs to have the ability to control the volume, volume, and volume, as well as the ability for the remote to change channels. Additionally, the Project Manager suggested that the new remote control should have a voice recognition function, as it would be easier for users to understand what's going on. The Project Manager emphasized the importance of having a simple and easy-to-use remote control, and suggested that it should be easy to use and easy to understand. The Marketing team agreed with the Industrial Designer's assessment that it was important to have a simple remote control that could be easily used, but they were concerned about the cost of the remote, as they were not sure if they could afford to pay for it. The Industrial Designer suggested that they would need to make the remote more expensive, but the Marketing team believed that it would not be necessary, as the cost would be covered by the price of the product. The project manager proposed that the project manager and Industrial Designer would design the remote with an LCD screen, and the marketing team agreed that it could be placed on the side of the device, as there was no need for a separate remote control for the LCD screen.",
    "The main elements of remote controls in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip and the battery. We have a number of different choices for a design concept and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of, but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work, industrial designer: user interface: how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device. once we've chosen a a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concept, making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features. We can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries, but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery, like are used in high-tech watches, where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up. The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever, you can work out which button's which and basically, yeah it's ith it's fun. So, you have buttons for your favourite channel, changing the volume, which is something you do all the time, and the button to switch it off, in case you get bored.",
    "The Industrial Designer and the Project Manager agreed on the need for a new design for the remote control, with the Industrial Designer suggesting the use of rubber as a material, while the Marketing team suggested using rubber as the material of choice. The Industrial Designer suggested using a rubber material for the buttons, as it would be more durable than plastic, and the project manager agreed to incorporate a rubber case into the design. The User Interface team agreed with the idea of using rubber, as they believed that it was a more durable material than rubber, and that it would make the remote more user-friendly. The Project Manager suggested that the user interface team should be able to change the shape of the remote to fit into different shapes and sizes depending on the user's preference, but they were not sure if it was necessary to use rubber or not. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating a battery into the remote, but the industrial designer believed that the cost of the battery would be too high, and they did not want to spend money on a battery when they could buy a new one. The project manager suggested that a battery could be used to power the remote instead of a rechargeable battery, which would allow the user to use the remote for a longer period of time without having to charge it every time they wanted to use it.",
    "Kirsty williams am: I think it's important to recognise that there are a lot of challenges facing the sector, and we need to be mindful of these challenges, but I think that we are in a good position to address them, and I think we have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and it is important that we continue to work together to ensure that the sector is well-regulated. We have a good relationship with HEFCW, and they have been very helpful in their efforts to support the sector. I think there is a lot to be gained from working with them in this regard, and that's something that we will continue to do. sian gwenllian am: Just turning to the issue of the remit letter, Kirsty, are you aware of the fact that it was introduced by the previous government, and are you confident that it will be incorporated into the new legislation? Kirsty Williams am: Yes, I think the Minister is aware of this issue, and the Minister has indicated that it is something that they will be looking to incorporate into the legislation in the future. We will look to incorporate it into the Bill, but we will also be looking at how we can incorporate it in the legislation, and whether it is appropriate to do so in the context of the current legislation.",

    "Hefin david am: Thank you, Kirsty. Kirsty, it is important to note that this is the first time that we have had to deal with a pandemic in Wales, and it is essential that we focus on the health and well-being of children and young people, and we need to ensure that they have access to the necessary care and support. Hefin David am: I would like to ask that Kirsty williams am clarify that the government is not planning to relax any of the restrictions that are currently in place, and that they will continue to be in place until the end of the pandemic, and they will only be relaxed when it is safe for the public to return to school and when they are confident that the health of their children and their families is in the best interests of the Welsh Government and the wider public. kirsty Willams am: We will need to take a lead from our scientific and medical advisers, and I want to also say that we are working on a four-nation basis and keeping in very close contact with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. But we're also looking beyond the United Kingdom to approaches to education in the face of this pandemic. So, recently I was able to talk to educationalists and Ministers in Iceland, other parts of Europe, North America, South America and Australia. And it is really heartening and humbling to see the way that they've responded to this crisis. And there are teachers, teaching assistants, and many others, who are helping our children and families to keep learning at home. And we also have to look at\u2014and it's been paraphrased quite a lot today\u2014if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting, which groups they should be. And, finally, how do we operationalise that? How do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be, and what do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we would do social distancing in the context of education, school transport issues, how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate, for instance? So, there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very, very carefully before we could return, before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education and new approaches to what schooling may look like. But, again, I must be absolutely clear to you, members of the committee, and to people watching: it is not feasible, in this sense, to start to discuss reopening schools when we haven't had the necessary testing in place for the majority of the population. And doesn't it convey a mixed message that we're starting to relax some of these restrictions when, in reality, the restrictions are still in place and still need to being in place robustly? Kirsty Williams Am: First of all, thank you very much, Si\u00e2n, for that important question. Secondly, we will have to consider any decision to have more children returning to school. It is the responsibility of me, as the Minister, and indeed of the wider Government, to begin to think about planning for the future. But I have been absolutely clear: we are not moving to an imminent change in how education is operating at the moment. And I am also very clear that should we be given the opportunity to see more children in our schools, I will only do that when it's safe for me to do so, when I've been given the reassurances that it will be safe for them to return.",
    "The project manager and industrial designer agreed that the remote control should be easy to use and easy to find, and they agreed that it should be able to be used in a variety of scenarios, with the aim of making it easy for users to find the remote. They also agreed to incorporate voice recognition into the remote, which would allow users to control the remote with their voice, as well as the ability to control it with their hands. However, the project manager expressed concerns about the cost of the device, as it would be difficult to produce a remote that could be sold for less than $100. The team agreed that they would need to find a way to make the remote more affordable, as they would have to spend more money to produce it. The industrial designer suggested that they could incorporate a voice recognition chip in the remote to make it more affordable. The project manager agreed with the industrial designer that this would be the most cost-effective way to achieve the goal of making the remote accessible to everyone, and that it would allow them to sell it for less money than a conventional remote control. They agreed that there was a need for a more affordable remote control, and the team decided to focus on making it easier to find and more affordable than a traditional remote control with buttons."
