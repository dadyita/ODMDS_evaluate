        "During the meeting, there was a discussion on the resource implications for higher education institutions in Wales. It was acknowledged that there are financial challenges facing the universities, including the impact of a demographic dip, increased pension costs, and uncertainty due to the Augar review and Brexit. It was noted that Welsh universities are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England due to funding differences.\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) stated that while the challenges are significant, there is not currently a crisis in the sector. The institutions are managing the challenges and taking steps to balance their books, although this may result in job losses and a reduction in capacity. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which increase funding for higher education in Wales, is seen as crucial for the future of the sector.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the financial reserves of universities. It was explained that while universities may have reserves, a significant portion of those reserves may be tied up in assets such as estates and are not immediately available as liquid cash. The operating cash generated by universities is an important measure of their financial sustainability and their ability to meet costs, including the costs of servicing borrowings.\n\nThe question of university reserves was raised, with concerns about whether universities are deploying their reserves effectively for the benefit of students. It was explained that while some universities may have substantial reserves, it is important to differentiate between distributable reserves and assets that are tied up in the estates. It was noted that universities have governance mechanisms in place to oversee their estates strategies and financing, and that borrowing decisions require the consent of HEFCW.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the possibility of universities facing financial stress and potential closures. It was emphasized that while the challenges are significant, there is currently no expectation of any institutions falling over in the foreseeable future. The institutions are managing the challenges and taking steps to address them, and HEFCW is closely monitoring their financial performance to ensure the interests of students are protected.\n\nRegarding collaboration between higher education and further education, it was noted that HEFCW has provided funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between the two sectors. The funding aims to support new and existing collaborative activities and promote local provision within specific regions.\n\nIn terms of research funding, it was acknowledged that maintaining and increasing funding for research is important for the capacity and competitiveness of the Welsh research base. It was noted that while there have been calls to maintain QR funding in real terms, the funding has not increased over the past nine years due to financial constraints. However, efforts are being made to increase support for research and innovation, including funding for innovation projects and improving universities' ability to access funding from UK-wide research bodies.\n\nThe potential impact of leaving the European Union on research funding was also discussed. It was acknowledged that the loss of EU funds could have a significant impact on future research, and efforts are being made to mitigate this impact through increased investment in research and improved collaboration with UK-wide research bodies. The importance of maintaining"

        "During the meeting, the discussions focused on several key topics related to the new curriculum in Wales. These topics included the integration of human rights, issues in special education, recruitment of professional staff, challenges in training staff for special education, emphasis on the more able and talented stream, standards in special schools, and the trend of teacher recruiting.\n\nThe Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams, provided an overview of the feedback received during the consultation period for the draft curriculum. The feedback included input from headteachers, teachers, governors, teaching assistants, young people, and the business community. Overall, there was broad support for the proposed curriculum changes, including the need for change and the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. There was also support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession, as well as the emphasis on formative assessment.\n\nHowever, there were also some areas of feedback that called for clarification and simplification of the language used in the curriculum. Some areas called for more detail and depth, while others wanted a reduction in complexity. The Minister acknowledged these concerns and stated that the feedback would be taken into consideration during the refinement process.\n\nIn terms of the timeline for the final curriculum, the Minister stated that a final version would be published in January 2020. The refinement process would involve subject specialists and practitioners who have specific expertise in subject areas. The curriculum would then go through an editorial process and be published in January 2020.\n\nThe Minister also discussed the inclusion of certain aspects of the curriculum in the primary legislation. Originally, the legislation was only going to include the four purposes and areas of learning and experience. However, based on feedback, the Minister announced that the 'what matters' statements and a statutory framework for progression in each area of learning and experience would also be included in the legislation.\n\nThe Minister addressed concerns raised about the integration of religious education (RE) and relationships and sexuality education (RSE) in the curriculum. Some people expressed the need for a clearer focus on Christianity in RE, while others wanted a broader approach that includes a range of faiths and world religions. In terms of RSE, some objected to its inclusion in the curriculum, while others emphasized the importance of preparing learners for a diverse society. The Minister stated that she would consider the feedback and make a statement on the government's intentions regarding RE and RSE.\n\nThe meeting also discussed potential unintended consequences of the new curriculum. The Minister emphasized that equity and principles of equality are driving the curriculum reform and that no policy changes would be pursued if they led to less equity in the education system. The Minister acknowledged the research conducted by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) and stated that the feedback and concerns raised would inform decision-making.\n\nConcerns were raised about the potential for segregation within schools and the impact on disadvantaged pupils and those with lower attainment. The Minister stated that she did not believe any changes would lead to segregation and that the four enabling objectives of the curriculum, including",

These topics included the integration of human rights into the curriculum, issues in special education and recruitment of professional staff, challenges in training staff for special education, the emphasis on the more able and talented stream, standards in special schools, and the trend of teacher recruiting along with the reasons and steps taken.\n\nIn regards to the integration of human rights, it was discussed that the curriculum should define qualifications rather than the other way around. The aim is to ensure that all children have the opportunity to learn about and understand human rights, including children's rights. The feedback received on the draft assessment proposals was generally positive, with support for the emphasis on ongoing assessment to support learning and progression.\n\nThere were also discussions on the transition from the foundation phase to post-16 education, with a focus on ensuring a smooth transition and alignment between the two systems. The involvement of early years professionals in the development of the curriculum was highlighted, as well as the need for resources to support the Welsh dimension in the curriculum.\n\nIn terms of accountability and evaluation, it was emphasized that assessment should be separate from accountability, and that the focus should be on using assessment to support learning and progression rather than as a means of ranking or judging schools. The role of self-evaluation and external verification by Estyn was highlighted as a way to ensure accountability and continuous improvement.\n\nRegarding physical activity, it was confirmed that all children will have the opportunity to participate in physical activity under the new curriculum. The specific amount of time allocated for physical activity was not discussed in detail, but it was emphasized that it should be a priority and that schools should ensure all children have access to physical activity opportunities.\n\nThe governance arrangements for the new curriculum were confirmed to remain the same, with no significant changes planned. The involvement of further education in the development of the curriculum was highlighted, as well as the need to ensure a smooth transition for pupils from pre-16 to post-16 education.\n\nLastly, it was discussed that pupil referral units and education otherwise than at school (EOTAS) will have a minimum standard of what is expected in terms of curriculum content, and that additional support and adaptations may be necessary based on the individual needs of the child.\n\nOverall, the discussions in the meeting provided valuable insights into the progress and considerations related to the new curriculum, addressing various aspects such as human rights integration, assessment, accountability, transition, physical activity, governance, and support for pupils with special educational needs."

        "During the meeting, Lynne Neagle AM asked David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and Bethan Owen, Deputy Chief Executive of HEFCW, about the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector. David Blaney explained that the main pressures and causes for these challenges include the impact of a dip in the number of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, uncertainty due to the Augar review in England and Brexit. He also mentioned that Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England. Despite these challenges, David Blaney stated that there is no crisis in the sector and that institutions are managing the situation. He did not foresee any institutions falling over in the near future. However, he acknowledged that there may be more costs being taken out, resulting in job losses and a reduction in capacity. Bethan Owen added that universities have reserves, but a large portion of it is tied up in their estates, making it less immediately available. She also mentioned that universities are facing increasing costs in servicing their borrowings. Angela Burns AM raised concerns about university reserves and asked if universities were becoming skinnier financially. Bethan Owen explained that while universities have reserves, a large portion of it is tied up in their estates and not readily available as liquid cash. She also mentioned that universities are generating less operating cash compared to English institutions. Angela Burns AM also asked if any universities have broken loan covenants or been close to doing so. Bethan Owen stated that there have been significant changes in accounting standards, which led to most universities renegotiating their covenants. She mentioned one university, the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, which disclosed the need to renegotiate their financing arrangements. David Blaney emphasized that institutions have an obligation to meet their commitments to students and that HEFCW has mechanisms in place to ensure that institutions are managing their financial challenges. Hefin David AM asked about the rigour and consistency of governance arrangements across institutions and if any governing bodies exhibit an imprudent risk appetite. David Blaney explained that governing bodies are expected to follow the guidance provided by the Committee of University Chairs and that there is a need for continual refreshing of governing bodies to ensure a variety of perspectives. He also stated that there are tensions between executive teams and governing bodies at times, but overall, the relationship is effective. Hefin David AM asked if there is a risk of more institutions falling into the high-risk category in the near future. David Blaney stated that while it is not guaranteed, there is a possibility of more institutions facing increased risk due to the financial pressures in the sector. Janet Finch-Saunders AM asked about the sustainability of part-time student numbers and if there could be significant fee increases for part-time students. David Blaney stated that while part-time students are more price-sensitive, he does not foresee significant fee increases as it would not be acceptable to the part-time market.

        "Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, provided evidence on the impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education during a meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Dr. Blaney stated that the uncertainty surrounding Brexit has had a significant impact on the higher education sector in Wales. He highlighted the importance of higher education to the Welsh economy, with universities contributing \u00a35 billion and 50,000 jobs annually. The potential loss of EU students, EU research funding, and structural funds poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of higher education providers in Wales. Dr. Blaney also mentioned anecdotal evidence of difficulties in EU collaborative research activities and the need for greater investment in facilities to attract prospective students. He noted that the decrease in EU student applications to study in Wales may be due to changes in student support arrangements and the perceived state of repair of campuses. However, he emphasized the importance of maintaining the quality of the higher education system in Wales and the need for continued investment in research and innovation. Dr. Blaney also highlighted the efforts of the sector to promote Wales as a safe and attractive place to study, as well as the importance of maintaining access to EU funding programs such as Erasmus+. He mentioned the need for clarity on the future relationship between the UK and EU in order to plan effectively and ensure the continued success of Welsh universities. In terms of funding, Dr. Blaney discussed the Diamond recommendations for higher education funding and student finance, and the need for transition funding to support the implementation of these recommendations. He also mentioned the potential impact of Brexit on attracting funding from UK research councils and charitable organizations, highlighting the importance of investment in research infrastructure and the ability to cover overhead costs. Overall, Dr. Blaney expressed concern about the uncertainties surrounding Brexit and the need for continued support and investment in the higher education sector in Wales."

        "During the meeting, the discussion focused on the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them, as well as Julie Morgan's perspective. The main points discussed were:\n\n- The Bill is not addressing child abuse, but rather aims to prohibit all forms of physical punishment in order to protect children's rights. Julie Morgan emphasized that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognizes that any physical punishment of children, however minor, is incompatible with their human rights.\n\n- There were concerns raised about the impact of the Bill on parents who use physical punishment as part of their parenting toolkit. Julie Morgan acknowledged that parenting is difficult and that there are alternative methods to physical punishment that can be used. She emphasized that the Bill aims to send a clear message that physical punishment is not acceptable, and that there are already a range of other ways to support parents in raising their children.\n\n- The discussion also touched on the potential increase in reporting of physical punishment incidents and the impact on social services and other agencies. Julie Morgan stated that while there may be an initial increase in reporting, the legislation is not expected to overwhelm social services or lead to a significant increase in workload. She highlighted the ongoing evaluation and monitoring that will take place to assess the impact of the legislation and ensure appropriate support is in place.\n\n- The need for effective multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs) was also discussed. While MASHs were acknowledged as valuable, it was stated that the effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on them. Close working between social services and the police is already established and will continue.\n\n- Concerns were raised about the potential diversion of resources for social services and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). Julie Morgan expressed confidence that both social services and CAFCASS have the capacity to handle the workload and that ongoing monitoring and evaluation will help identify any issues.\n\n- The importance of investing in parenting support services and early intervention strategies was emphasized. Julie Morgan mentioned the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign and the need to update it to cover a wider age range. She also mentioned the mapping exercise being conducted to identify gaps and opportunities for further support. The discussion highlighted the need for a more coordinated and robust early intervention strategy.\n\n- The readiness of teachers for the legislation was discussed. Julie Morgan stated that the education sector is represented in the implementation group and that teachers would be included in the awareness campaign and training already provided for childcare issues. The cost of training was mentioned, and it was suggested that incorporating the training into existing programs would minimize additional costs.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the importance of the Bill in protecting children's rights and the need for ongoing evaluation and support to ensure its effective implementation. The discussion also underscored the importance of investing in parenting support services and early intervention strategies.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion focused on the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them. Karen Cornish, a participant in the meeting, stated that the main concerns raised were similar to those raised previously. She mentioned that there were already procedures in place for teachers and other workforces to address these issues, as they fall under safeguarding. She also highlighted the importance of creating a whole-school approach to mental health and well-being and fostering an atmosphere where children feel comfortable bringing up any concerns with trusted staff members.\n\nJulie Morgan, another participant in the meeting, emphasized the need for a clear understanding of the new legislation and the importance of raising awareness about it. She mentioned that the Healthy Child Wales program and health visitors play a crucial role in promoting positive parenting and that the removal of the defense in the Bill would allow them to do so more effectively. However, there were concerns raised about the accessibility of the program, especially in certain areas. The government acknowledged the need to reach all families and committed to identifying gaps in parenting support and addressing them.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the impact of the legislation on teachers and the disclosure of non-conviction data. The participants stated that teachers are already expected to report instances of physical punishment and that the legislation would not change that. They mentioned that the disclosure of non-conviction data is a rigorous process and that only a small number of cases result in information being released during employment checks.\n\nRegarding the resourcing of the legislation, the participants acknowledged that there could be unknown costs but stated that they were doing their best to anticipate and cover all eventualities. They mentioned that the impact on public services would not be significant as they already deal with similar issues. They also mentioned the ongoing discussions with the Finance Minister and the consideration of costs during the budgeting process.\n\nThe participants addressed the human rights implications of the legislation, stating that the Bill is necessary to protect the rights and freedom of children. They mentioned that the rights of parents are not absolute and that action can be taken to interfere with them if justified. They emphasized the importance of protecting children from inhumane or degrading treatment and stated that the legislation is proportionate and balanced in its approach.\n\nIn terms of awareness raising, the participants agreed on the need for a significant campaign to raise awareness about the legislation. They mentioned the success of similar campaigns in other countries and committed to working with organizations and communities to ensure that the information reaches all groups. They acknowledged the survey results showing a misunderstanding of the current law and stated that the legislation aims to provide clarity and protect children's rights.\n\nOverall, the meeting discussed various aspects of the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them. The participants addressed concerns, provided explanations, and committed to taking necessary actions to ensure the successful implementation of the legislation."

        "During the meeting, the WISERD research findings and concerns raised regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system were discussed. The findings showed that the targeting of funding to improve educational outcomes for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds has improved over time. Initially, the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement in general, rather than specifically targeting the underachievement of students eligible for free school meals. However, the targeting has improved, although it is not perfect.\n\nThe research also highlighted the need to address the underachievement of more able and talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds. There was a lack of awareness among schools about the needs of these students and a focus on supporting underachieving students instead. The research suggested that schools should improve their identification of more able students and provide them with additional support to achieve their full potential.\n\nThe research also examined the effectiveness of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) in improving educational outcomes for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It found that the PDG has been targeted better over time, but there are still areas for improvement. Schools are using the grant to track progress, improve attendance, work with families and the community, improve exam results, and enhance students' confidence and literacy and numeracy skills. However, there is a need for more emphasis on community-focused initiatives and engaging with parents and the community.\n\nThe research also discussed the challenges faced by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, such as attendance issues and the impact of changes to performance measures. It highlighted the need for a more sustainable approach to improving outcomes, focusing on curriculum development, teaching quality, and long-term skill development.\n\nIn terms of looked-after and adopted children, the research found that there was some confusion among schools about the use of the PDG for these groups. There have been efforts to improve engagement with these students and their families, but more work is needed to address their specific needs.\n\nRegarding the Schools Challenge Cymru program, the research found that its effectiveness varied among schools. Some schools made significant improvements, while others did not. The program focused on improving performance indicators, particularly at key stage 4, but there were concerns about the sustainability of these improvements. The research suggested that the program needed more time to evaluate its effectiveness properly.\n\nOverall, the research highlighted the importance of targeted funding and support for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. It emphasized the need for a comprehensive and sustainable approach to improving educational outcomes, including community engagement, curriculum development, and teaching quality.",
        "The WISERD research findings highlighted in the meeting discussed the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. The meeting acknowledged the shift in focus from literacy and numeracy to curriculum and pedagogy, and the promotion of collaboration and self-improvement. It was recognized that progress in the education system has been slow due to the numerous changes happening and the workload on teachers. The meeting also highlighted concerns about the consistent performance of students and the need for more significant outcomes. The meeting discussed the ongoing changes in the education system and the potential risks of continuous changes preventing development. The importance of involving schools in sharing good practices and promoting community-focused schools was emphasized. The meeting also discussed the challenges faced by secondary schools compared to primary schools and the need for effective self-evaluation processes in local authorities. The performance of special schools and pupil referral units was also addressed. The meeting highlighted the positive improvement in further education colleges, attributed to strong leadership, collaborative culture, and effective governance. However, concerns were raised about work-based learning and the need for improved monitoring and quality assurance. The meeting also discussed the role of directors and the challenges faced by local authorities and consortia. The need for consistent approaches and sufficient resources for the consortia was emphasized.

        "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. In relation to the duty to promote public awareness, the Deputy Minister introduced amendments 1 and 4, which would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. The Deputy Minister also responded to amendments 1A to 1E, which were tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders. She explained that these amendments were not necessary as they added unnecessary provisions to the Bill and that the level of detail they proposed was not required on the face of the Bill. The Deputy Minister also emphasized her commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over a six-year period from Royal Assent, should the Bill be passed. \n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2, which would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of the legislation. She explained that this provision would come into force the day after Royal Assent and that the post-implementation review of the Bill would be a continuous program of work conducted over the years following the commencement of section 1. The Deputy Minister also addressed amendment 2C, which would require a report on the awareness-raising campaign to be prepared and laid before the Assembly before section 1 is commenced. She argued that this amendment was unnecessary and in conflict with the need for certainty on the commencement date and the ability to work towards it with partners and stakeholders. The Deputy Minister assured the committee that the effectiveness of the awareness-raising campaign would be assessed and that the findings would be shared with the committee.\n\nDuring the discussion, Janet Finch-Saunders expressed her support for amendments 1A to 1E, which proposed additional requirements for the duty to promote public awareness. She highlighted the need for a sustained awareness campaign, particularly for harder-to-reach groups, and called for an independent evaluation of the campaign's effects before section 1 commences. Suzy Davies also raised concerns about the length of time for the post-implementation review, arguing that seven years was too long and suggesting a three-year reporting period instead. She also proposed amendments to specify the timeframe for reporting and to consult with the committee on the contents of the interim report. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian expressed her support for the Deputy Minister's offer to provide an interim report and to consult with the committee on the issue.\n\nIn response, the Deputy Minister expressed her willingness to consult and discuss with the committee on the contents of the interim report and training requirements. She also stated that the amendments proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders made little difference in practical effect and that the Government amendments already covered",
        "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. She emphasized the importance of regular reporting of public attitudes and stated that all the areas raised by the amendments were relevant. She also expressed her willingness to work with the members to bring forward amendments at Stage 3. The Deputy Minister assured the members that the impacts of the Bill had been thoroughly considered before its introduction and that no evidence suggested that public services would be overwhelmed following the law reform. She stated that the costs associated with the implementation of the legislation would be closely monitored and that a revised regulatory impact assessment would be provided at Stage 3. The Deputy Minister also highlighted the ongoing engagement with stakeholders, including the Association of Directors of Social Services and the police, to ensure effective implementation of the legislation. In response to the members' concerns about the potential consequences of the legislation, the Deputy Minister explained that the guidance and procedures of non-devolved bodies, such as the Crown Prosecution Service and the police, were outside the control of the Welsh Government. She argued that it would be inappropriate to make the commencement of the Bill conditional on the decisions of these bodies. The Deputy Minister disagreed with the proposed amendments that sought to delay the commencement of the Bill until certain conditions were met, as she believed it would create uncertainty and potentially jeopardize the legislation. She emphasized the importance of the good working relationships with the CPS and the police and their involvement in the strategic implementation group. The Deputy Minister urged the committee to reject the proposed amendments and assured them that the impacts of the legislation would be closely monitored and any necessary actions would be taken to manage workloads, resources, and costs."
