        "During the meeting, Lynne Neagle asked David Blaney and Bethan Owen about the financial sustainability of the higher education sector in Wales. They discussed the financial challenges facing universities, including the impact of a demographic dip, increased pension costs, and uncertainty due to the Augar review and Brexit. They also highlighted the funding gap between Wales and England and the challenges of balancing the books while maintaining capacity and quality. The introduction of the Diamond reforms was seen as crucial, and the forthcoming year would see an increase in resource funding to higher education. The performance of the sector was praised, but concerns were raised about the impact of stress on staff. Angela Burns asked about university reserves and whether universities were skinnier cats now compared to four years ago. The discussion touched on the importance of having liquid cash reserves and the need for universities to generate surplus cash to meet their costs. It was noted that some universities had to renegotiate their covenants due to changes in accounting standards. There was confidence that universities would not do the \"dirty\" on their students and that they would continue to deliver on their commitments. The discussion then shifted to governance arrangements and the need for a consistent minimum set of expectations for governing bodies. The importance of constructive challenge and the dynamic within governing bodies was emphasized. The potential for more institutions to be classified as high risk was acknowledged, but there was confidence that institutions were managing their challenges. The allocation of funding for the 2019-20 academic year was discussed, including the increase in funding for part-time provision and support for expensive and higher cost subjects. The need for greater transparency in reporting income and expenditure was acknowledged, and efforts were being made to improve the accessibility of this information. The impact of underfunding research and the need to maintain QR funding in real terms was discussed. The importance of QR funding for sustaining the research base and attracting funding from other sources was emphasized. Concerns were raised about the sustainability of current funding levels and the need for increased investment. The allocation of funding for educational research and the transition away from EU funding were also discussed. The need for increased investment in research and innovation, as well as better collaboration and engagement with UK-wide initiatives, was highlighted. The potential for accessing funding from UKRI and the role of innovation funding in supporting access to external funding were mentioned. The importance of embedding Welsh research in UK-wide conversations and strengthening relationships with UK research bodies was emphasized. The positive developments in research funding and the potential for future investment were acknowledged. The recent work on the \"basket of goods\" show regarding student accommodation costs was mentioned, but no specific details were provided.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the potential impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, provided insights into the potential challenges and risks that the sector may face. One of the main pressures identified was the funding position, particularly as the recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are being implemented. While the funding for the 2018-19 academic year has been allocated, the extent to which future funding will be available is uncertain. This uncertainty may affect institutions' ability to plan for the future and invest in capital infrastructure, which could impact their competitiveness.\n\nAnother pressure mentioned was the decrease in applications from EU and non-EU students. This could have financial implications for institutions as it may reduce fee income. The change in student support arrangements for EU students was identified as a possible reason for the decrease in applications. The attractiveness of institutions' campuses and facilities was also mentioned as a factor that may affect recruitment.\n\nIn terms of addressing these challenges, institutions are exploring various strategies. They are looking for additional sources of funding and working to strengthen their marketing efforts, both within the UK and internationally, to attract students. They are also making efforts to maintain and enhance student mobility programs, particularly in light of potential changes to the Erasmus+ program. The sector is working with the Welsh Government to advocate for continued access to EU research funding and is exploring opportunities for collaboration with UK universities.\n\nThe impact of Brexit on fee and access plans was also discussed. Institutions are considering the potential impact of Brexit on student recruitment and mobility and are including measures in their fee and access plans to address these issues. However, the extent of the impact will depend on the final arrangements for Brexit and the ability of institutions to attract students and find alternative sources of funding.\n\nIn terms of quality assurance, the impact of Brexit was seen as potentially affecting the richness of the student experience due to a decrease in the number of EU students. However, the baseline quality standards for degrees are not expected to be affected. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales works closely with the National Union of Students in Wales to ensure student interests are protected and participates in discussions on the impact of Brexit on higher education.\n\nOverall, the sector is actively monitoring and planning for the potential challenges and risks posed by Brexit. Institutions are taking a managed approach to financial sustainability and are exploring various strategies to address the potential impact on student recruitment, funding, and mobility programs. The role of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales is to provide guidance and support to institutions, monitor their financial sustainability, and challenge their assumptions and plans when necessary.",
        "The discussion on resource implications during the meeting focused on two main perspectives: Julie Morgan's perspective on unforeseen costs and Karen Cornish's perspective on the given budget.\n\nJulie Morgan emphasized the need to invest further in research and the broader research agenda for Wales, including STEM, arts, humanities, and social sciences. She highlighted the impact of social science research on public policy and the need for sufficient researchers to be able to participate in larger research projects. She also mentioned the importance of having competitive core research funding for universities to be competitive in securing UK-wide research funding.\n\nMorgan acknowledged that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently engaged in conversations with research councils and emphasized the need for better engagement to respond to research challenges effectively. She mentioned the intention to systematize this engagement to improve Wales' position in the research market.\n\nRegarding the potential difficulties after Brexit for researcher collaborations and networks, Morgan noted that the impact would depend on the Brexit deal. She highlighted the importance of being part of Horizon Europe and the signaling effect of being in the game. She also mentioned the significance of maintaining research quality, impact, and critical mass to win more research funding and establish a stronger presence in the international research market.\n\nKaren Cornish discussed the issue of attracting research funding from the charitable sector in Wales. She mentioned the challenges related to overhead funding and the need to increase quality-related research funding to attract more charitable sector research funding. She acknowledged that overhead funding is an issue in other parts of the UK as well.\n\nIn response to the question about the impact of the Bill on social services, Morgan stated that the effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs). She mentioned that social services already work closely with the police and have well-established mechanisms in place for joint working. However, she acknowledged the potential benefits of MASHs and mentioned the establishment of a multi-agency strategic group to consider the effectiveness of MASH arrangements in Wales.\n\nRegarding the potential increase in workload for social services, Morgan acknowledged the concerns raised by social workers and stated that the implementation group is addressing these concerns. She mentioned the ongoing evaluation, monitoring, and data collection to assess the impact of the legislation and the commitment of social services to cope with the demand. She also mentioned the importance of ongoing support for parents and the need to identify gaps in support services through a mapping exercise.\n\nMorgan emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach to support parents and children, including parenting advice and support, data collection and evaluation, operations and procedures, and out-of-court disposals and diversions. She mentioned the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign and the intention to update it to cover a wider age range. She also mentioned the universal services and targeted supports already in place, such as Flying Start and Families First, and the ongoing mapping exercise to identify gaps and opportunities for more support.\n\nIn response to the question about teachers' readiness for the legislation, Morgan mentioned the representation of the education sector on the implementation group",
        "The discussion on resource implications during the meeting focused on the perspectives of Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish. Julie Morgan highlighted the use of out-of-court disposals by the police and the need to work with various organizations to consider suitable interventions. She mentioned that the National Police Chiefs' Council is focused on reducing disposal options to two, conditional caution and community resolution. She also mentioned the importance of developing a diversion scheme to provide advice and support on positive alternatives to physical punishment. Karen Cornish added that non-conviction data and disclosure requirements, such as enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service checks, are important considerations. She stated that the police follow a quality assurance framework when disclosing information and that it is assessed by the chief officer to determine if it is relevant and should be disclosed. She also mentioned that the release of non-conviction information is relatively low and that the police and DBS have a rigorous process in place. Suzy Davies expressed concerns about the potential impact on parents when non-conviction data is disclosed, especially in professions where exemptions do not apply. Julie Morgan emphasized the close working relationships with various organizations and the commitment to addressing concerns. Lynne Neagle requested an update on the latest work done on out-of-court disposals, including estimated costs, as well as discussions with the DBS and the figures related to disclosure of non-conviction information. The discussion on resource implications did not directly address Julie Morgan's perspective on unforeseen costs or Karen Cornish's perspective on the given budget.",
        "The discussion on resource implications in the meeting focused on the perspectives of Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish. Julie Morgan highlighted the expected costs and funding for the childcare offer in Wales. She stated that based on current take-up rates and increases each month, the government expects to spend around \u00a350 million to \u00a355 million in the current financial year. The government has already allocated \u00a340 million for this purpose and is committed to providing the total funding needed to deliver the offer. She also mentioned that the offer has been well-received and has led to increased flexibility in work for parents. Karen Cornish raised concerns about the potential for increased demand for the childcare offer and the availability of funding to meet that demand. Julie Morgan assured her that the government is committed to providing the necessary funding and that local authorities will not have to find extra money from their own budgets.",
        "During the meeting, there was a discussion on resource implications, including perspectives from Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish. Gareth Pierce from the WJEC mentioned that while the organization is doing as much as it can with the budget it has, there is always a need for further resources. He explained that the WJEC relies on funding from schools and colleges and needs to make choices within the budget. Mike Ebbsworth added that teachers often have the idea that they need to have everything, but that is not always the case. The focus has been on different means of assessment, and resources have been shifted accordingly. Philip Blaker mentioned the need for a common core of resources to be available bilingually, while also allowing for creativity and adaptation by teachers. He suggested that not all materials should be bilingual, as that may inhibit the creation of more creative resources. The discussion then moved on to the \u00a3500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resources in the budget. Gareth Pierce mentioned that the WJEC has information on how that budget will be spent, but the exact allocation would need to be confirmed by the Welsh Government. There was also discussion on the timeline for producing textbooks and the challenges involved. Darren Millar raised concerns about the delays in producing textbooks and the potential disadvantage for learners who rely on traditional textbook learning methods. Gareth Pierce explained that efforts are being made to produce Welsh-medium textbooks simultaneously with English versions, but that it is a challenging process. The discussion also touched on the impact of the lack of resources on students' well-being and the fairness of the situation. Gareth Pierce acknowledged that some students may have been negatively affected by the lack of suitable support materials, but noted that there are many factors at play in students' achievement. The meeting also highlighted the importance of resources that support analysis and evaluation skills, and the need for collaboration between organizations to ensure the success of the new curriculum and qualification reforms.",
        "During the meeting, it was discussed that the resource implications of Brexit on higher and further education are a concern. It was mentioned that there has been a drop in EU student applications in Wales, which is attributed to the change in government policy regarding student support. The funding commitments for the Diamond and Reid reviews were also discussed, with assurances given that Welsh Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Diamond review. The issue of multi-year funding for higher and further education was raised, with concerns about the uncertainty caused by Brexit. It was mentioned that the European funding for apprenticeships is secure until 2020, but there are concerns about funding beyond that point. The importance of collaboration between different government departments and institutions was emphasized to ensure the sustainability of higher and further education. The impact of Brexit on student recruitment and immigration rules for international and EU students were also discussed. Overall, the Welsh Government is working to address the challenges and uncertainties posed by Brexit in order to support the higher and further education sectors."

        "Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM had differing opinions on the role of local authorities in quality assurance of individual institutions. Sharon Davies believed that local authorities should have a greater role in quality assurance, as they have a closer understanding of the needs and challenges of individual institutions within their jurisdiction. She argued that local authorities could provide valuable support and guidance to institutions in improving their quality standards. On the other hand, Kirsty Williams AM expressed the view that quality assurance should be the responsibility of individual institutions and their governing bodies. She believed that institutions should be held accountable for their own quality standards and that local authorities should focus on providing a supportive environment for institutions to thrive.\n\nDuring the meeting, Sian Gwenllian AM inquired about quality assurance and expressed her concerns about the lack of consistency and transparency in the process. She questioned the effectiveness of the current quality assurance system and asked Kirsty Williams AM for her response. In response, Kirsty Williams AM acknowledged the need for improvement in quality assurance and highlighted the ongoing work of an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff. She stated that the board's recommendations would help inform future actions and improvements in quality assurance.\n\nOverall, there were differing opinions on the role of local authorities in quality assurance, with Sharon Davies advocating for a greater role and Kirsty Williams AM emphasizing the responsibility of individual institutions. The concerns raised by Sian Gwenllian AM highlighted the need for improvements in the current quality assurance system.",
        "The opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance of individual institutions were not explicitly mentioned in the given meeting. The meeting focused on other topics such as the mental health of young people and the pay dispute in the FE sector. Therefore, it is unclear what their specific opinions are on this matter.\n\nIn the meeting, Sian Gwenllian AM inquired about quality assurance and Kirsty Williams AM responded by discussing the importance of self-evaluation in the education system. She mentioned that the Welsh Government has been working with the OECD to develop a national evaluation and improvement resource that will help schools in their self-evaluation process. This resource is currently in the testing phase and is expected to be implemented in September 2020. Williams also mentioned the need for a UK approach to quality assurance and the importance of external verification of the education system.\n\nOverall, the meeting did not provide detailed information about the opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance. However, it highlighted the importance of self-evaluation and the ongoing efforts of the Welsh Government to improve the education system.",
        "During the meeting, the Minister for Education, Kirsty Williams, provided some insights into the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales. She discussed the principles that would guide the decision on when schools can reopen, emphasizing that the decision would be based on the safety and well-being of children and staff. The Minister stated that a return to normal is not imminent and that a phased approach would be taken. She also highlighted the importance of testing and tracing in the next phase of reopening schools. \n\nIn terms of the current situation, the Minister acknowledged the challenges faced by vulnerable children and outlined efforts to support them. She mentioned that the number of vulnerable children attending school hubs has doubled in the past week, but acknowledged that the numbers are still small. The Minister also addressed the issue of emotional and mental health difficulties experienced by children and the allocation of \u00a31.25 million for school counseling services. She emphasized the need for flexibility in providing support, including remote counseling, and professional development for counselors. \n\nThe Minister also discussed the concern about the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers. While she acknowledged that the situation is a challenge, she assured that efforts are being made to support vulnerable children and ensure they have access to education and support services. The Minister highlighted the importance of ongoing communication and collaboration with local authorities, social services, and other stakeholders to address the needs of vulnerable children during this time.",
        "During the feedback period on the draft curriculum, there was broad support for the curriculum changes and the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. The opinions on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions in religious education (RE) were mixed, with some wanting a stronger focus on Christianity and others wanting a broader approach. Concerns were raised about the compulsory nature of RE and the need to respect parents' views. In relation to relationships and sexuality education (RSE), there were objections to it being included in the curriculum and calls for it to be solely the responsibility of parents. The main concerns were about potential challenges with teaching controversial topics and the need for guaranteed access to the full curriculum. The Minister will be considering the feedback and making a statement on the government's intentions for RE and RSE. The final curriculum is expected to be published in January 2020, and the Bill introducing the curriculum will be introduced after the Easter recess, with the aim of implementing the curriculum in September 2022. The Minister values the work of the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD) and takes their research into account. The Minister does not believe that the curriculum will exacerbate segregation or have unintended negative consequences, and she is committed to ensuring equity and closing the attainment gap. The Minister has made progress in bridging the gap between the Welsh Government and local government, with renewed engagement from the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales. Lessons have been learned from the introduction of the curriculum in Scotland, particularly in relation to the need to consider assessment alongside curriculum content. The quality control of the curriculum content in Wales has involved a smaller group developing the materials and engaging with cluster groups for testing and feedback. The cluster approach will continue to be important as schools move forward with implementing the curriculum.",
        "During the meeting, the opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance of individual institutions were not discussed. However, Sian Gwenllian AM inquired about quality assurance and Kirsty Williams AM responded to her question by stating that there is a need for clear distinction between assessment for learning and accountability. Williams also mentioned that pupil surveys could be used as part of the accountability regime and that the government is interested in looking at practices from other countries. Overall, the meeting did not provide a thorough discussion on the opinions of Davies and Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance.",
        "Estyn, the education and training inspectorate for Wales, has reported that the targeting of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) has improved over time. Initially, the grant was often used to tackle underachievement in general, rather than specifically targeting children eligible for free school meals. However, Estyn found that the targeting has become more effective, although there are still cases where the grant is not being used exclusively for eligible students. Estyn also noted that more needs to be done to support more able and talented students who are eligible for free school meals, as they often miss out on the PDG. Estyn suggested that schools could do more to evaluate the impact of the PDG and use evidence-based approaches to improve outcomes for disadvantaged students. They also highlighted the importance of community engagement in supporting these students. Estyn acknowledged that the PDG has had some positive impact on attendance, but more needs to be done to address the attendance gap between students eligible for free school meals and their peers. The report also highlighted concerns about the narrowing focus on Key Stage 4 and the need to develop sustainable skills and engagement with the curriculum. Overall, Estyn suggested that stronger leadership and a focus on evidence-based practices are key to improving the effectiveness of the PDG in narrowing the attainment gap.",
        "In the meeting, it was discussed that there was some confusion among schools regarding the grant for looked-after children and adopted children. Schools were not aware of the grant and how it could be used to support these learners. However, regional consortia are now using the grant and providing training to schools. Some schools are also engaging in school-to-school work and offering individual bursaries to support the work with these children. It was mentioned that the pupil-level annual school census data does not differentiate between adopted and non-adopted children, making it difficult to track the progress of adopted children. However, efforts are being made to improve the tracking of looked-after children by the consortia. The effectiveness of the PDG grant in addressing issues faced by adopted children was discussed, and it was mentioned that more evidence is needed to determine its impact. The effectiveness of the Schools Challenge Cymru program was also discussed, with varying opinions on its success. It was noted that the program had some positive outcomes, but there were also challenges and variations in its implementation across schools. The need for a longer-term program to see significant improvement was highlighted. The engagement between Estyn and Schools Challenge Cymru advisers was also discussed, with mixed opinions on its effectiveness. The impact of funding cuts on schools was acknowledged, with concerns about the potential negative effects on staff and resources. The importance of involving the community in schools and the need for better sharing of good practice was highlighted. The success of special schools in implementing good practice was mentioned, but challenges in pupil referral units were noted. The importance of evaluating initiatives and the need for better evaluation skills in schools were discussed. The differences between primary and secondary schools in terms of standards and challenges were highlighted, with a focus on the widening gaps and the pressure on secondary schools to meet performance indicators. The need for more consistent community-focused schools and the positive impact of regional collaboration were mentioned. The challenges and potential solutions in work-based learning were discussed, with a focus on leadership and quality management. The turnover of directors in local authorities and the impact on self-evaluation processes were discussed, with an emphasis on the need for consistent approaches and better training. The challenges faced by consortia and the need for better support and resources were mentioned. The importance of effective communication between consortia and local authorities was highlighted, as well as the need for adequate funding for consortia."

        "During the meeting, several key points were discussed regarding the profitability, situation, reports, and government policy on long-term care for seniors. One of the main concerns raised by Ms. Laurel Collins was the government's commitment to eligibility criteria that result in regular people not getting the support they need, while corporations and billionaires receive government help. She mentioned that other countries, like Poland, Denmark, and France, have made commitments to not provide government funds to companies using offshore tax havens, and questioned whether the Canadian government would do the same. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded by stating that the government's measures are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for.

        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector were discussed in a meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. The meeting included representatives from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), who provided insights into the financial sustainability of the sector.\n\nThe financial challenges facing Welsh universities can be attributed to several causes. Firstly, the impact of a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than in other parts of the UK, has resulted in a decrease in student numbers. Additionally, increased pension costs and overall increased costs have put financial strain on institutions. Furthermore, the current uncertainty surrounding the Augar review in England and the implications of Brexit have added to the financial challenges faced by Welsh universities.\n\nThese challenges are not unique to Wales, as many universities across the UK are also facing financial difficulties and are implementing cost-cutting measures. However, Welsh higher education institutions face an additional challenge due to the pre-existing funding gap between England and Wales. Welsh institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off compared to their English counterparts.\n\nDespite these challenges, the sector is being managed and there is no immediate crisis. However, institutions are taking measures to balance their books, which often results in job losses and a reduction in capacity. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which aim to increase funding for higher education in Wales, is seen as a positive step in addressing these challenges.\n\nIn terms of financial sustainability, the reserves of universities were discussed. While universities do have reserves, a large portion of these reserves are tied up in their estates and are not immediately available as liquid cash. The operating cash generated by universities is an important measure of their financial health, and Welsh institutions generate less operating cash compared to their English counterparts.\n\nThe financial sustainability of Welsh universities is further influenced by external factors such as changes in accounting standards and fluctuations in income flows. The governing bodies of universities play a crucial role in overseeing financial matters and are expected to adhere to good governance practices outlined by the Committee of University Chairs. However, there is room for improvement in terms of governance culture and ensuring governing bodies are well-informed and ask the right questions.\n\nIn terms of part-time student funding, there has been an increase in part-time student numbers in Wales. While funding for part-time provision has been increased, sustainability within current arrangements is a concern. The impact of Brexit on research funding was also discussed, with a need for increased investment in research and innovation to mitigate the potential loss of EU funding.\n\nOverall, while the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are significant, they are being managed, and efforts are being made to address them. The sector continues to make positive contributions to Wales in terms of student experience, research impact, and economic benefits.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are primarily related to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its potential impact on the sector. The sector is exposed to sources of income from the EU, such as EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and the future of these income sources is unclear. There are signs of impact on applications from EU students and difficulties in participating in EU collaborative research activities. The financial impact of Brexit is also uncertain, as it depends on the political relationship between the Welsh Government and the UK Government. Other pressures include the funding position, pay and pension costs, increased student expectations for modern facilities, and the uncertainty about potential consequences from the review of fees and funding in England. The Welsh Government is implementing the recommendations from the Diamond review to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, innovation, and research funding. However, the timing and extent of this funding is still unclear. The sector is also working on promoting Wales as an attractive place to study and attracting funding from other sources, such as charitable funding. The Welsh Government is monitoring the recruitment of teachers and working on initiatives to address the shortage of teachers, including financial incentives, recruitment marketing, and accreditation of ITE provision. The government is also waiting for reports from an advisory group on teacher recruitment and retention. The challenges in teacher recruitment and retention are not unique to Wales and are being experienced globally. The government is trying to understand the reasons behind the lack of interest in teaching and is exploring different approaches to address the issue.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are varied. One of the challenges is the need to increase the number of qualified teachers, especially those who can teach through the medium of Welsh. The Welsh Government is working to address this by introducing new incentives and alternative routes into teaching qualifications. Another challenge is the need to improve the outcomes for learners in higher apprenticeships. The Welsh Government is taking action to address this by reviewing the regional skills partnerships and implementing the recommendations of the Graystone review. The government is also focused on achieving parity of esteem between academic and vocational education and is working to increase investment in vocational education. Additionally, the government is prioritizing mental health and well-being support for students and is working with universities and colleges to develop strategies and action plans in this area. The government is aware of the pay dispute in the further education sector and recognizes the need for a resolution to ensure the best interests of students and the reputation of colleges.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are primarily related to funding issues and uncertainty surrounding Brexit. In a meeting, the concerns were raised about the impact of funding issues on the ability to recruit and retain staff in further education (FE) colleges. The employers were using the funding issue as a reason not to reach a settlement with staff, which could have a major impact on staff recruitment and retention. The meeting also discussed the potential impact of Brexit on the higher education (HE) sector, including the drop in EU student applications in Wales and the uncertainty surrounding EU funding for research and apprenticeships. The Welsh Government has been working closely with the sector to understand the specific challenges and develop strategies to mitigate the risks. The government has also been in discussions with ColegauCymru and the trade unions to address the dispute and find a resolution. In terms of preparedness, the government has been monitoring the situation closely and providing support to institutions as needed. The government has also been engaging with the National Union of Students and other stakeholders to understand their concerns and address them. In terms of long-term funding, the government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Diamond and Reid reviews, which aim to provide a sustainable funding system for higher and further education. The government is also working to secure funding for apprenticeships and maintain learning opportunities that are currently funded by the EU. The government is in discussions with the UK government to ensure that Wales receives the funding it has been promised and to advocate for the needs of the Welsh higher and further education sectors. Overall, the government recognizes the challenges facing the sector and is taking proactive steps to address them and support the institutions and students.",
        "The role of the WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee) and Qualifications Wales in ensuring that students and teachers in Wales have the necessary resources for general qualifications is primarily focused on the design and assessment of qualifications. The WJEC provides specifications and exemplar assessments to the regulator, while Qualifications Wales sets out approval criteria and monitors the awarding of grades to ensure fairness and maintain standards.\n\nThe WJEC also produces digital resources and provides teaching guidance for new courses, as well as offering professional development opportunities for teachers. They work with publishers to encourage the production of textbooks, and the Welsh Government provides funding for the translation of these textbooks into Welsh.\n\nHowever, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales do not have a role in regulating commercial publishers or the provision of textbooks. The responsibility for textbooks and learning resources lies with commercial publishers and the Welsh Government, respectively.\n\nThere are concerns about delays in the availability of textbooks, but these are often due to the tight timelines for qualification reforms. The WJEC and Qualifications Wales are working to address these issues and ensure that future reforms allow for sufficient time and system readiness.\n\nOverall, the focus of the WJEC and Qualifications Wales is on the design and assessment of qualifications, rather than the provision of textbooks and learning resources. However, they do play a role in providing guidance and support to teachers and monitoring the quality and standards of qualifications.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are discussed in the meeting. The WJEC, as a funding recipient, needs to use its budget prudently as most of its funding comes from payments made by schools and colleges for assessments. They have to make choices within their substantial budget in terms of the work they undertake. There is also a need to be careful in identifying resources and needs that are suited towards the requirements. Teachers sometimes have the idea that they need to have everything, but that is not always the case. The focus has been on different means of assessment in recent years and resources have been directed towards meeting the needs of teachers in that area. There is a discussion about the \u00a3500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resources and how it will be spent. The WJEC has some information on the budget and discussions with publishers. There is a need for flexibility in the use of the funding to support research work and seminars for publishers. The meeting also discusses the challenges and delays in producing and translating textbooks and other educational resources. There are concerns about the impact on students and teachers, especially in terms of stress and well-being. The meeting acknowledges the need for resources to be available in both English and Welsh, but there are challenges in terms of timing and coordination. The meeting also raises questions about the fairness and equality of access to resources and the impact on student achievement. The meeting concludes with a discussion on the future of resources and curriculum development in Wales, including the need for collaboration and a national approach."

        "During the meeting, the discussion revolved around the issues with HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) and the decision made regarding them. Julie Morgan, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, provided her perspective on the matter.\n\nIn response to a question about the opposition to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, Julie Morgan explained that the Bill aims to prohibit all forms of physical punishment in order to protect children's rights and ensure they have the same protection as adults. She acknowledged that people have different views on the issue, but emphasized that any physical punishment of children, no matter how mild, is incompatible with their human rights. She also mentioned that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognizes this and supports the principles of the Bill.\n\nIn regards to the concerns raised by parents about using physical punishment as part of their parenting toolkit, Julie Morgan reiterated that there is no place for physical punishment in raising children. She acknowledged that parenting is challenging, but emphasized the need to provide alternative methods and advice to parents. She mentioned that there are a range of other ways to help parents and that the Bill aims to provide clarity and consistency by removing the defense of reasonable punishment.\n\nWhen asked about the potential impact on social services and social workers, Julie Morgan acknowledged the concerns about increased workload. She mentioned that social services already receive and investigate reports of physical punishment and that the Bill does not change the threshold for intervention. She highlighted the importance of ongoing evaluation and monitoring to ensure the legislation is implemented in a practical and workable way.\n\nRegarding the implementation of the Bill in schools, Julie Morgan stated that teachers are already familiar with procedures related to physical punishment and that the education sector is represented in the implementation group. She mentioned that the awareness campaign will target professionals in all fields, including teachers, to ensure they are prepared for the changes.\n\nIn terms of support services for families and parenting, Julie Morgan acknowledged the need for investment in programs and services.

        "During the meeting, the discussion focused on the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them. Julie Morgan, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, provided some perspective on the matter. She stated that the process with HMRC is still ongoing and they are in the process of reviewing the issues. The committee raised concerns about the cost of moving to a child-centred approach and Julie Morgan explained that they are currently conducting a review to assess the potential costs and implications of such an approach. Nicola Edwards, an official, provided some figures regarding the number of children eligible for the childcare offer and the current uptake. It was mentioned that there are approximately 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales, but only about 34,000 children are currently eligible for the offer. It was also noted that half of the children are in non-working families due to the requirement that both parents must be in work in a two-parent household. Lynne Neagle, a member of the committee, raised concerns about the age group targeted by the childcare offer and suggested that a child-centred focus should be considered. Julie Morgan acknowledged this concern and mentioned that they are looking into the possibility of extending the offer to younger children. Dawn Bowden, another member of the committee, asked about the future of the parent, childcare, and employment programme in light of Brexit. Julie Morgan explained that the programme has recently been extended with additional funding from the European social fund, but the future funding beyond 2022 is uncertain. She mentioned that the UK government has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, including the parent, childcare, and employment programme, but there have been no definite promises regarding funding beyond that.

        "According to Estyn, the effectiveness of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) has improved over time. Initially, the grant was not being targeted specifically towards children eligible for free school meals, but it has since been better focused on this group. However, there is still some blurring of eligibility criteria, with schools interpreting poverty in a wider sense. Estyn suggests that more attention needs to be given to targeting more able and talented pupils who are also eligible for free school meals, as they are often overlooked. The PDG has been used for a variety of purposes, including tracking progress, improving attendance, working with families and the community, and improving exam results. However, Estyn recommends that schools focus less on key stage 4 and more on developing sustainable skills. The report also highlights the importance of using evidence-based practices and engaging with learners, parents, and the community. The effectiveness of the PDG in narrowing the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and their peers is difficult to determine, as there are many factors at play. However, there have been small improvements in attainment, but a major step change has not been achieved. The report suggests that more attention needs to be given to community-focused initiatives and the engagement of families. Estyn also acknowledges that there is a lack of clarity and awareness among schools regarding the PDG for looked-after and adopted children. Efforts are being made to improve this, including the appointment of regional LAC coordinators and training for schools on emotional behavior and attachment. However, more work needs to be done in this area. Overall, Estyn emphasizes the importance of strong leadership and effective implementation of the PDG in order to achieve positive outcomes for disadvantaged students.",
        "During the meeting, there was a discussion about various issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them. One of the issues raised was the exclusion rates of children in different areas and the impact of managed moves on these rates. Julie Morgan AM expressed her concern about attendance of looked-after children and asked for more information on the topic. Mark Reckless AM asked about the appropriate use of the pupil deprivation grant and whether it should be spent on all vulnerable children or specifically on looked-after children. Meilyr Rowlands, the representative from Estyn, stated that if the grant is specifically for looked-after children, it should be targeted towards them. The discussion then shifted to the evaluation of the Schools Challenge Cymru program. Meilyr Rowlands stated that the program was variable and had both successful and less successful outcomes. He highlighted the importance of a longer period of time for evaluating the success of such programs. The discussion also touched on the engagement between Estyn and the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers, with Mark Reckless AM questioning the usefulness of this engagement. Meilyr Rowlands stated that the engagement with the advisers was not a problem, but rather the engagement between the various agencies involved in the program. The conversation then moved on to the PLASS data and its collection of information on previously looked-after children who are now adopted. Meilyr Rowlands stated that the data currently collected does not differentiate between adopted children and looked-after children, and further clarification on this issue is needed. The discussion then turned to the implementation of the foundation phase in schools. Meilyr Rowlands highlighted the importance of proper implementation of the foundation phase and expressed concern that many headteachers do not fully understand its principles. He emphasized the need for more training and support in this area. The conversation then shifted to the performance of schools in different sectors, with Meilyr Rowlands stating that primary schools generally have higher standards than secondary schools. He noted that there is greater variability in standards in secondary schools, but also more excellence. The discussion then touched on the issue of accountability measures and their impact on subject choices for students. Meilyr Rowlands stated that changes in performance indicators and examinations can have a direct impact on subject choices. The meeting also addressed the topic of community-focused schools and their importance in involving the community and improving educational outcomes. Meilyr Rowlands expressed support for the concept of community-focused schools and highlighted the need for more sharing of good practice in this area. The conversation then turned to the standards of special schools and pupil referral units. Meilyr Rowlands stated that special schools generally have high standards, while pupil referral units are more variable. He highlighted the need for more collaboration and sharing of good practice in pupil referral units. The meeting also discussed the performance of further education colleges and work-based learning providers. Meilyr Rowlands highlighted the improvement in further education colleges and the need for greater consistency in work-based learning providers.

        "The Welsh Government uses a variety of methods to identify schools that need support or intervention. This includes the school categorisation system, Estyn inspection reports, and local intelligence. The school categorisation system is primarily used to identify where resources should be directed and to assess the risk level of schools. Estyn inspections provide accountability and hold schools and governing bodies to account for their performance. The government is working to improve the identification of schools in need of support and intervention, particularly in secondary schools. They are piloting a multi-agency approach to support schools causing concern, bringing together local authorities, regional consortia, Estyn, and Welsh Government to provide targeted support and guidance. The government acknowledges that more needs to be done to identify and support schools earlier, before they reach a critical stage. They are also exploring the use of additional data, such as staff sickness rates, to identify schools at risk. The government is committed to continuous improvement in the identification and support of schools in need.",
        "Estyn's annual report highlights the importance of the new curriculum in the education system and the need to ensure that standards do not slip during the period of change. While there may be challenges in the transition, there is confidence that standards will not decline. The report also acknowledges the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools, with secondary schools facing greater challenges. Funding for schools is identified as a potential factor impacting preparedness, with secondary schools more likely to be in deficit compared to primary schools. The report also raises concerns about the shortage of teachers, particularly in secondary schools and in certain subjects. It suggests the need for a long-term strategy to attract more people to the teaching profession and considers various routes into teaching, including degree apprenticeships. The report also highlights the issue of underperforming secondary schools, with around 10% judged to be failing and 12% under Estyn review. It emphasizes the importance of leadership and the quality of teaching and learning in addressing this issue. The report suggests that the new curriculum will play a crucial role in improving the quality of teaching and learning in secondary schools, but acknowledges that it will take time to see the full impact.",

        "During the meeting, it was discussed that the findings and concerns raised by WISERD research regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system were broadly supported. The research highlighted the potential for segregation between different groups of students in schools, but it was emphasized that the new curriculum aims to promote equity and ensure that all students have access to a high-quality education. The implementation of the curriculum will involve ongoing professional learning for teachers, with a focus on supporting their understanding and implementation of the new curriculum. The innovation schools, which have been selected to participate in the refinement of the curriculum, will play a key role in this process. The assessment proposals were also discussed, with an emphasis on the importance of ongoing assessment to support student learning and progression. It was acknowledged that there may be challenges in ensuring consistency and clarity in assessment practices, but efforts are being made to provide guidance and support to schools. Regarding accountability, it was noted that the new curriculum and assessment system will require a reevaluation of current accountability measures. The intention is to move away from a focus on high-stakes testing and league tables and instead emphasize self-evaluation, professional standards, and ongoing support and development for teachers. The ultimate arbiter of accountability will be Estyn, the inspection body, which will provide public assurance and confidence in the system.",
        "The findings and concerns raised by WISERD research regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system are as follows:\n\n1. PDG Targeting: The research found that there is a lack of awareness among schools regarding the targeting of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) for students from different socio-economic backgrounds. While there is a clear understanding of targeting students eligible for free school meals, there is less awareness of the targeting for students who are looked after or adopted.\n\n2. Performance and Resilience: The research highlights that the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds can vary. While there have been improvements in attendance and attainment for some students, there is still a gap between the performance of students from different backgrounds. The research also suggests that the impact of PDG on narrowing the attainment gap has been mixed.\n\n3. Use of PDG: The research shows that the majority of schools are making well-thought-out and appropriate decisions on how to use PDG funding. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of PDG in some schools, particularly in terms of the impact on attendance and attainment. There is a need for schools to demonstrate evidence-based interventions and to track the impact of their decisions.\n\n4. Flexibility and Eligibility: There are discussions around the eligibility criteria for PDG, particularly for students who have been looked after or adopted. There is a need for greater flexibility in the criteria to ensure that all students who could benefit from PDG are included.\n\n5. Accountability and Monitoring: There is a need for greater accountability and monitoring of PDG funding to ensure that it is being used effectively and to track the impact on student performance. The role of regional consortia and regional PDG advisers is crucial in providing support and guidance to schools.\n\n6. Performance Measures: There is a need for more sophisticated performance measures to assess the impact of PDG on student performance. The current focus on the level 2 threshold may not adequately capture the progress and achievements of students from different backgrounds. There are discussions around developing new performance measures that take into account individual student progress and value-added by schools.\n\nIn summary, while there have been improvements in the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of PDG and the need for greater accountability and monitoring. There is a focus on developing more sophisticated performance measures and addressing the specific needs of different student groups, such as looked-after and adopted children.",
