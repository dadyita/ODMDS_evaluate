    "  The group's opinion on the effectiveness of using eligibility for free school meals as a measure is that it is the best measure available to identify pupils who require additional support, but it is not a perfect measure. Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, acknowledges that using eligibility for free school meals as a proxy for need has its limitations, but it is the best option available at present.\n\nThe group recognizes that there are challenges in targeting the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) appropriately, particularly in cases where schools use their PDG funding to provide universal interventions that may not have a disproportionate effect on free school meal pupils. To address this, the group emphasizes the importance of schools providing evidence that their interventions are targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals and that they are using the PDG to support those children who are most in need.\n\nThe group also discusses the possibility of changing the current system of allocating PDG funding, which is based on eligibility for free school meals, to a more flexible system that takes into account longer-term projections. Kirsty Williams mentions that they are actively looking at introducing an 'Ever 2' concept, which would provide greater flexibility and longer-term approach to allocating PDG funding. However, she also notes that introducing such a system would require an additional \u00a340 million in funding, which is not currently available.\n\nIn summary, the group's opinion is that while using eligibility for free school meals as a measure has its limitations, it is the best available option at present. They emphasize the importance of targeting interventions appropriately and providing evidence of their effectiveness, and they are actively exploring ways to introduce a more flexible system for allocating PDG funding.",
    "  The professor discussed support vector machines and speech rate algorithms for speech recognition. The professor explained that the feature extraction process in speech recognition involves taking a spectrum and computing the Mel-cepstrum. The professor also mentioned that they tried using two multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with three outputs - voice, unvoice, and silence - and feeding them with the fifteen base features from the eh bus base system. The professor suggested that instead of computing the variance of the difference between the two spectra, which is the traditional approach for voiced-unvoiced recognition, they could use a different feature, such as energy. The professor also mentioned that they could try adding up the probabilities of all the voiced phones and unvoiced phones to see how well they do.\n\nThe professor also discussed the issue of making decisions based on what they have already seen versus making them later, and the importance of carefully looking at what France Telecom is doing with their program. The professor mentioned that they don't understand why France Telecom is using a constant in the expression of the lower energy and suggested that it may have something to do with the fact that it's a natural log. The professor also mentioned that they thought maybe they have a meaning for it.\n\nIn summary, the professor discussed various approaches to feature extraction and recognition in speech recognition, including the use of support vector machines and speech rate algorithms. They also discussed the importance of carefully evaluating the techniques used by other researchers, such as France Telecom.",

    "  Hefin David AM and Huw Irranca-Davies have expressed concerns about the fee, access plans, affordability for the lowest-income working families, pilots in Cardiff and Newport, and the qualification and quality of the workforce while maintaining the rate at \u00a34.50. Hefin David AM questioned the administrative burden of the current approach, which involves parents providing wage slips and birth certificates, and the complexity of the system, which has led to technical issues and volume issues in England. Huw Irranca-Davies AM acknowledged that there are cultural and economic issues that affect the take-up of the childcare offer, such as the tradition of grandparents providing free, unregistered childcare. He emphasized that the childcare offer is not just about providing childcare but also about the wider aspects that come with it, such as education, and that the focus is on registered and licensed providers. Hefin David AM asked how many registered and licensed grandparents there are, and Huw Irranca-Davies AM replied that they don't think there are huge numbers but they are having discussions with the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years. Hefin David AM also questioned the view of the National Day Nurseries Association that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain, and Huw Irranca-Davies AM replied that they don't agree and that the childcare offer gives them an opportunity to make it more resilient and robust. He emphasized that they are investing \u00a360 million of capital money into childcare facilities and have a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare. Hefin David AM asked if it is realistic to think that there will be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product, and Huw Irranca-Davies AM replied that yes, he thinks it is, absolutely, because of the work they're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out and the additional work commissioned from Arad.",
    "  The discussion centered around the topic of on-line and phase normalization, with PhD C and the professor discussing the best ways to analyze speech overlap. The professor suggested looking at the distribution of energy and taking a simple approach by comparing the energy levels when two people are speaking at the same time. PhD C agreed that this was a good starting point and suggested considering pitch-related factors to help with the analysis. The group also discussed the idea of looking at individual speakers and their overlaps, rather than trying to find a feature that works for all types of overlaps. They also touched on the idea of simplifying the analysis by starting with something that is easy to see, such as energy, and then adding more layers of complexity. Ultimately, the group decided to explore different features and visualize them in a reasonable way to determine which ones work best for the task at hand.",

    "  The discussion centered around the involvement of system, backups, and collecting notes with meetings, Switchboard, and scheduling meetings going forward. Professor A suggested that they should broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just internal ones, and have people write summaries. However, Professor D was worried that if they pushed people to do it, it might be semi-random and not provide the desired information.\n\nGrad G suggested using the notes that a designated note-taker takes during a meeting, and Professor D suggested doing a bunch of recordings and sending them off to IBM to get transcriptions. They could then start looking at what they want to know about the transcriptions and think about how to come up with queries.\n\nPhD B suggested having a plot of who's writing when, which could allow them to go into the hot places where people are writing things down. PhD B also suggested that they could tell when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said, and that wouldn't take any extra effort.\n\nProfessor D suggested that they could use a system that recognizes when people are writing and tells them not to doodle or use the note-taking feature for other purposes. They could also have a feature that allows users to put their hand on the pad to indicate that they are taking notes.\n\nPhD E suggested that they could use the summaries to get structure without having to do something artificial later. Professor A suggested that the core thing is to get some of these issues nailed down, do a bunch of recordings, and send them off to IBM to get transcriptions.\n\nIn summary, the group discussed various ways to collect data and generate queries for a meeting recording system. They considered using designated note-takers, recognizing when people are writing, and doing word frequency counts on summaries. They also discussed the importance of getting transcriptions and using them to develop a better understanding of what people are saying in meetings.",

Lynne Neagle AM asked how long the pathfinders have been going on, and Jo-anne Daniels replied that they started in February and are still in the early stages of unpicking and mapping current provision of services.\n\nHefin David AM raised the issue of the alignment of the childcare offer for Wales to the foundation phase, citing a recommendation in a report that the Welsh Government, local authority education, and childcare policy and delivery teams should merge. Julie Morgan responded that the report was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and made several points, including the need for co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers, which the government has taken on board. She also mentioned that the government is working to encourage the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings.\n\nFinally, Hefin David AM asked what percentage of children will see the issue of traveling between multiple locations resolved, and Julie Morgan replied that while co-location is not feasible universally, the government is encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which will help alleviate the issue to some extent. However, she acknowledged that there will still be areas that are not covered.",

    "  The discussion on mean subtraction in SRI experiments centered around the use of a high-pass filter or a band-pass filter to remove low-frequency components from the speech signal. The goal is to improve the performance of the system by eliminating the impact of background noise and baseline drift. The team discussed various techniques for implementing the filter, such as using a twelve-second window to calculate the mean, and experimenting with different window sizes to see what works best. They also considered using a second pass to refine the processing and decoding of the speech signal. The idea is to use a simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism to come up with possible alternates of what might have been said, and then decode that using speech that has been actually processed using a longer time subtraction. The team also discussed the possibility of caching the utterances to get the full benefit of the policy.\n\nThe main concern raised was the potential impact on the interactive response time of the system, as multiple passes could slow down the processing time.
