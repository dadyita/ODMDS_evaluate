    "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the financial challenges facing universities in Wales. These challenges include the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, uncertainty from the Augar review and Brexit. Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England due to a funding gap. The institutions are managing these challenges, but there is a concern that taking out costs to balance the books may have a detrimental effect on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which will increase funding for higher education in Wales, is seen as crucial in addressing these challenges.\n\nJulie Morgan's perspective on unforeseen costs emphasized that there are no plans to close any departments at Lampeter and that institutions have an obligation to meet their commitments to students. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) has a quality assurance process in place to ensure that institutions are managing their challenges and that students are not adversely affected. The financial reserves of universities were also discussed, with an emphasis on the need to consider the distributable reserves that are available as liquid cash.\n\nKaren Cornish's perspective on the given budget noted that the funding allocations for the 2019-20 academic year have been published. The allocations include an increase in recurrent teaching funding, maintaining funding for research, increasing support for expensive and higher cost subjects, and strategic funding for initiatives such as civic mission and mental health and well-being. The Minister's remit letter also calls for increased openness and transparency around the use of fee income, and the HEFCW is working with universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of this information.\n\nThe discussion on resource implications also touched on part-time student funding, research funding, and the impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. Part-time student numbers are increasing in Wales, and the HEFCW has allocated funding to support part-time provision and incentivize collaboration between higher education and further education. The sustainability of this funding within current arrangements was discussed, with a recognition of the need to prioritize Diamond funding in this area.\n\nRegarding research funding, the importance of maintaining QR funding in real terms was emphasized, as it supports the research base and attracts other funding opportunities. The allocation for 2019-20 does not specifically mention educational research, but the HEFCW's remit includes encouraging universities to develop this area of research. The Diamond and Reid reviews called for the maintenance of QR funding, but it has not increased in the past nine years due to a lack of available funds.\n\nThe impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education was also discussed, with pressures identified as funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and the uncertainty surrounding the review of fees and funding in England. The decrease in applications from EU and non-EU students was seen as a potential consequence, and efforts are being made to assess the potential risks and opportunities of Brexit and develop contingency plans. HEFCW monitors fee and access plans to ensure institutions are prepared for potential",

    "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector include the impact of a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and increased costs in general. The uncertainty surrounding the Augar review in England and Brexit also contribute to the challenges. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a funding gap between England and Wales, and Welsh higher education institutions are still approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which increase funding for higher education in Wales, is important in addressing these financial challenges. The financial challenges are affecting the capacity of institutions to deliver for Wales, and there are concerns about the impact on staff well-being.\n\nIn terms of university reserves, a significant portion of those reserves is tied up in their estates and not immediately realizable. The operating cash generated by universities is also lower compared to English institutions. Universities have been investing in their estates through borrowings, and the costs of those borrowings are increasing, which affects their operating cash. The financial challenges may lead to more job losses and a reduction in capacity.\n\nThe allocation of funding for the 2019-20 academic year includes an increase in recurrent teaching funding, maintained funding for research, increased support for expensive and higher-cost subjects, and funding for collaboration between higher education and further education. There is a need for increased openness and transparency in reporting the use of fee income, and efforts will be made to improve the accessibility of information on income and expenditure.\n\nRegarding part-time student funding, there has been an increase in part-time student numbers in Wales compared to the rest of the UK. Funding has been allocated to support part-time provision, and there are plans to continue supporting and funding growth in part-time provision. The sustainability of part-time student funding within current arrangements will be assessed, and work will be done to prioritize Diamond funding.\n\nIn terms of research funding, there are concerns about the lack of increase in QR funding, which is important for sustaining and growing the research base in Wales. The funding allocation for 2019-20 does not increase QR funding, but efforts will be made to encourage universities to develop educational research. The allocation of funding to Wales for research is smaller compared to other parts of the UK.\n\nThe financial challenges are also influenced by factors such as the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its impact on EU student recruitment and funding, a decline in teacher training applications, a decrease in the number of students studying through the medium of Welsh, and a reduction in funding for part-time provision. The Welsh government is taking steps to address these challenges by improving teacher training programs, offering financial incentives, implementing a national recruitment campaign, and reforming the post-16 education sector. The government is also working to ensure that universities are investing in initiatives that promote equality and opportunity for underrepresented groups.\n\nOverall, the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector require a comprehensive and coordinated approach that addresses issues related to access, affordability, outcomes",
    "Dr. David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, expressed concerns about the impact of Brexit on Wales' higher education system. He highlighted the uncertainty surrounding relationships and arrangements with Europe as a major concern for university management. There has been a decrease in EU students applying to study in Wales, with an 8% drop in EU applicants compared to a 2% increase for English institutions. Factors contributing to this decline may include changes in student support arrangements for EU students and the level of investment in facilities and infrastructure.\n\nFinancial pressures on the higher education sector were also discussed, with funding being a main concern. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations, which aim to re-establish funding for higher cost provision and innovation, is crucial for the sector's sustainability. However, the timing and amount of funding are still uncertain. The potential impact on fee and access plans was also discussed, as the decrease in EU student applications could affect fee income.\n\nDr. Blaney emphasized the need for increased investment in the research base in Wales, particularly in STEM areas. He mentioned the importance of having enough researchers and competitive core research funding to access UK-wide research pots. The potential impact of Brexit on researcher collaborations and networks was also mentioned.\n\nDespite these challenges, Dr. Blaney believes that the situation is being managed and there is no crisis in the sector. The Welsh Government has allocated additional funding to support the sector in dealing with demographic changes and the impact of Brexit. They are also working on initiatives to boost international marketing and attract more international students to Wales.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Blaney's opinion is that Brexit will have a negative impact on Wales' higher education system, particularly in terms of the drop in EU students applying to study in Wales. However, he highlights the importance of the Diamond reforms and the support from the Welsh Government in mitigating some of the negative effects. He also emphasizes the quality of higher education in Wales and the commitment to providing support for students.",
    "The Canadian government took proactive steps to address trade barriers affecting interprovincial trade of essential goods during COVID-19. They worked to streamline regulatory processes, remove unnecessary barriers, and coordinate efforts with provincial and territorial governments. Financial support was provided to businesses to help them overcome trade barriers.\n\nTo ensure the safety and well-being of Canadians with disabilities, the government included measures in the budget. This included increased funding for disability support programs, investments in accessible infrastructure and transportation, and access to financial support like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). Measures were also implemented to protect their health and safety.\n\nIn terms of acquiring necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), the government worked with domestic and international suppliers to secure a stable supply. They also partnered with Canadian companies to increase domestic production.

They invested in high-speed internet availability for all Canadians and provided supports and assistance to those who lost their jobs. They acquired PPE by working with various partners and jurisdictions and provided supports for charities and non-profits.\n\nOverall, the Canadian government took various measures to address trade barriers, ensure the safety and well-being of Canadians with disabilities, and acquire necessary PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. They aimed to support the economy, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure the availability of essential goods and services.",
    "During the meeting, the issues with HMRC were discussed, including Julie Morgan's perspective. Julie Morgan explained that the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill is not about child abuse, but rather about prohibiting all forms of physical punishment to protect children's rights. She emphasized the importance of hearing different views but expressed confidence in the updated law. Julie Morgan stated that there is no place for physical punishment in bringing up children and that there are other ways to discipline them. She mentioned that social services in other countries have not been overwhelmed by similar legislation and that ongoing evaluation and monitoring will be conducted. Julie Morgan also discussed the role of schools in implementing the Bill, stating that teachers will receive training on how to respond to incidents of physical punishment. The government is exploring the development of a diversion scheme for parents who engage in physical punishment. The meeting also touched on the need for increased support for parents and parenting programs, and the government is conducting a mapping exercise to identify gaps in support services. The impact of the legislation on the police and the Crown Prosecution Service was discussed, with Julie Morgan stating that the police already have procedures in place to respond to incidents of physical punishment. \n\nIn addition to the issues with HMRC, the meeting covered other topics. Kirsty Williams, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, discussed the decline in the number of students entering teacher training programs and the measures the government has implemented to address this decline. The meeting also addressed the need to maintain and grow funding for part-time undergraduate study. The government is committed to ensuring a high-quality teacher workforce and supporting students in their education and career aspirations. \n\nThe meeting also discussed the Welsh Government's commitment to post-compulsory education and training reforms, the need for collaboration between institutions, and promoting access and opportunities for higher education. The issue of university mergers was addressed, with the Cabinet Secretary stating that institutions are free to collaborate if they see it as beneficial. The importance of vision and collaboration in promoting parity of esteem between academic and vocational education was emphasized. \n\nFunding for higher education was briefly mentioned, with the Cabinet Secretary highlighting the importance of equity in funding and the Diamond reforms. The meeting also touched on the issue of mental health in universities and the need for a strategic approach to well-being and mental resilience for students. The ongoing pay dispute in further education colleges and the issue of essay mills were also discussed. The Cabinet Secretary expressed a commitment to pay equality in teaching and an awareness of the potential impact of the dispute on staff recruitment and retention. She is also working with the UK Government and other stakeholders to combat academic misconduct.",
    "The WISERD research findings and concerns raised regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system were discussed in a meeting. The research highlighted issues with the targeting of funding towards children eligible for free school meals and the potential exclusion of more able and talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The meeting emphasized the need for schools to better identify and support these students. Concerns were raised about the overemphasis on key stage 4 and the need for a more sustainable, long-term approach to improving student outcomes. The challenges of engaging with parents and the community, the impact of changes to performance measures, and the importance of evaluating interventions were also discussed.\n\nThe OECD is involved in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey and has conducted a rapid review of Welsh education. Their report is expected to be published in March. The national evaluation and improvement resource, developed in collaboration with the OECD, aims to support schools in identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. The investment in school standards, with 50% directed towards professional learning for teachers, is seen as crucial. The School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013 gives local authorities powers of intervention in schools, although the Welsh Government has not used these powers. The national categorization system is used to identify schools that need support or intervention, and the government is piloting a multi-agency approach to supporting schools causing concern. The government is also exploring new ways of identifying schools that need support.\n\nThe WISERD research findings emphasized the need for targeted interventions and support for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The meeting discussed the lack of coordination and self-evaluation in the education system and the importance of a collective effort to address these challenges. The variation across local authorities and the need for consistency were highlighted. Early identification of problems and a multi-agency approach involving regional school improvement services were emphasized. The meeting also discussed the categorization system and the need for a more sophisticated approach. Overall, the meeting highlighted the concerns raised by the research and the need for targeted interventions and support to improve the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. The meeting emphasized the importance of a coordinated and collective effort, as well as the involvement of parents and community schools. The meeting also discussed the financial situation and the allocation of funding, with suggestions for additional funding to support teacher training and the implementation of the new curriculum. Potential strategies to address the concerns were discussed, including a long-term solution to improve the quality of teaching and learning.",
    "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. She explained that her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment. She also mentioned that she had considered other amendments related to the duty to raise awareness, but found them unnecessary or duplicative.\n\nIn response to the committee's recommendation, the Deputy Minister committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from Royal Assent if the Bill is passed. She explained that the campaign would be comprehensive and reach all communities, and that specific groups did not need to be highlighted on the face of the Bill. She also stated that the duty to promote awareness among children was unnecessary as children's rights were already prioritized in policy making. The Deputy Minister emphasized that the Bill aimed to remove a defence to an existing criminal offence, and therefore did not require provisions on how to raise concerns about physical punishment.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2 to put a duty on Welsh Ministers to undertake a post-implementation review of the Bill. She explained that the review would be a continuous program of work, including attitudinal surveys and data collection, to track changes in public attitudes and monitor the effectiveness of the awareness-raising campaign. The Deputy Minister argued against amendment 2C, which would require a report on the awareness-raising campaign before section 1 commences, stating that it was unnecessary and could disrupt the implementation of the Bill. She assured the committee that the effectiveness of the campaign would be assessed and shared with the committee through various methods.\n\nIn response to the committee's concerns about the reporting period, the Deputy Minister offered to provide an interim report before section 1 commences, and to consult with the committee on its contents. She acknowledged the importance of evaluating the impact of the Bill and stated that all areas of interest raised by the committee would be considered. The Deputy Minister also expressed willingness to discuss amendments 2D and 2E to address concerns about the reporting period and the laying of the report. She urged the committee to reject the non-Government amendments and agree to her amendments 2 and 5, which she believed achieved the same policy aim without unnecessary detail on the face of the Bill.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Deputy Minister discussed various aspects of the amendments made in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. The discussion touched on topics such as the effectiveness of Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hubs (MASHs), the workload of social workers, the impact on CAFCASS, the role of education sector in implementing the legislation, the disclosure of"
