        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the financial challenges facing universities in Wales. These challenges include the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, uncertainty from the Augar review and Brexit. It was noted that Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England due to a funding gap. The institutions are managing these challenges, but there is a concern that taking out costs to balance the books may have a detrimental effect on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which will increase funding for higher education in Wales, is seen as crucial in addressing these challenges.\n\nRegarding the perspective of Julie Morgan on unforeseen costs, it was mentioned that there are no plans to close any departments at Lampeter and that institutions have an obligation to meet their commitments to students. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) has a quality assurance process in place to ensure that institutions are managing their challenges and that students are not adversely affected. The financial reserves of universities were also discussed, with an emphasis on the need to consider the distributable reserves that are available as liquid cash.\n\nIn terms of Karen Cornish's perspective on the given budget, it was noted that the funding allocations for the 2019-20 academic year have been published. The allocations include an increase in recurrent teaching funding, maintaining funding for research, increasing support for expensive and higher cost subjects, and strategic funding for initiatives such as civic mission and mental health and well-being. The Minister's remit letter also calls for increased openness and transparency around the use of fee income, and the HEFCW is working with universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of this information.\n\nIn terms of part-time student funding, it was acknowledged that part-time student numbers are increasing in Wales. The HEFCW has allocated funding to support part-time provision and incentivize collaboration between higher education and further education. The sustainability of this funding within current arrangements was discussed, with a recognition of the need to prioritize Diamond funding in this area.\n\nRegarding research funding, it was noted that the Diamond and Reid reviews called for the maintenance of QR funding in real terms. However, the funding has not increased in the past nine years due to a lack of available funds. The importance of QR funding in supporting the research base and attracting other funding opportunities was emphasized. While the HEFCW has not conducted a specific assessment of the impact of underfunding research, external experts such as Graeme Reid have highlighted the correlation between QR funding and the capacity to generate funding from other sources. The allocation for 2019-20 does not specifically mention educational research, but the HEFCW's remit includes encouraging universities to develop this area of research.\n\nOverall, the discussion highlighted the financial challenges facing universities in Wales and the efforts being made to manage these challenges and support the higher education sector. The importance of maintaining funding for research and promoting collaboration between higher education and further education was",
        "The discussion on resource implications during the meeting focused on the impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education. The main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector were identified as funding, student recruitment, pay and pension costs, and the uncertainty surrounding the review of fees and funding in England. The decrease in applications from EU and non-EU students was seen as a potential consequence of the change in student support arrangements for EU students and the need for increased investment in facilities and infrastructure. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) has been working with universities to assess the potential risks and opportunities of Brexit and has provided advice and guidance. The universities themselves have been developing contingency plans and exploring additional sources of funding to mitigate the impact of Brexit. HEFCW also monitors the fee and access plans of institutions to ensure they are properly prepared for potential changes resulting from Brexit. The discussion also touched on the importance of promoting Wales as a safe and attractive place for international students to study and the need for continued access to EU research funding. Overall, the meeting highlighted the challenges and uncertainties facing Welsh higher education due to Brexit, but also the efforts being made by institutions and HEFCW to address these challenges and ensure the sustainability of the sector.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on two perspectives: Julie Morgan's perspective on unforeseen costs and Karen Cornish's perspective on the given budget. Julie Morgan emphasized the need for institutions to find ways of promoting and resourcing mobility efforts, especially in light of potential changes to the Erasmus+ program. She acknowledged that there may be some uncertainties and challenges related to Brexit, but expressed optimism about the positive impact of ongoing discussions and negotiations. She also highlighted the importance of protecting student interests and ensuring that institutions fulfill their commitments to students.\n\nKaren Cornish discussed the potential financial implications of the Diamond review and the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales. She acknowledged that there is uncertainty about the level of transition funding that will be provided to the higher education sector. However, she emphasized that the Welsh Government is committed to supporting research and innovation infrastructure and that recommendations from the Reid report will help guide funding decisions. She also acknowledged the need for clarity and certainty in budgetary processes and expressed hope that the political commitment to reinvest savings from the Diamond review into the higher education sector will be honored.\n\nIn summary, the discussion highlighted the importance of promoting and resourcing mobility efforts, protecting student interests, and ensuring financial stability in the higher education sector. The Welsh Government is committed to addressing these resource implications and working closely with stakeholders to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by Brexit and the implementation of the Diamond review.",
        "During the meeting, the discussion on resource implications focused on the potential costs and workload impact of the proposed legislation. Julie Morgan, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, acknowledged concerns about unforeseen costs but stated that the government is prepared to cover all eventualities. She mentioned that \u00a32.2 million over six years has been allocated for an awareness-raising campaign. However, the exact amount needed for resources cannot be determined at this stage, and the government will rely on data and assessments to measure the impact and make necessary adjustments. \n\nRegarding awareness-raising, the meeting highlighted the need for a significant campaign to inform the public about the proposed legislation. While a recent survey showed that 58% of the public believed that the law already prohibited physical punishment, Morgan recognized the challenge of ensuring public understanding. She expressed her commitment to a joint effort and stated that she is open to considering any suggestions from the committee to strengthen awareness-raising efforts.\n\nIn terms of human rights, Morgan emphasized that the proposed legislation aims to strike a balance between the rights of children and parents. She stated that the provisions of the Bill are necessary to protect the rights and freedom of children and are proportionate measures. The impact assessments conducted by the government consider the relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and justify any interference with those rights.\n\nThe meeting also touched upon concerns about potential disparities and disproportionate impacts on specific groups, such as women, minority ethnic groups, and low-income families. Morgan acknowledged the importance of reaching out to these groups and stated that focus groups and collaborations with various organizations will be conducted to ensure awareness and support. The mapping exercise being conducted will help identify any gaps in parenting support, and the government will consider providing funding to address those gaps.\n\nOverall, the government is committed to addressing resource implications, conducting a comprehensive awareness campaign, and ensuring that the proposed legislation respects human rights and mitigates any potential disparities."

They acknowledged the challenges and complexities involved in ensuring high standards of education and expressed a commitment to working collaboratively to address these issues. Sian Gwenllian AM's inquiry about quality assurance prompted Kirsty Williams AM to provide a comprehensive response, outlining the government's efforts to improve quality assurance in education.",
        "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been involved in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey through two reviews. The first review, conducted at the beginning of the Assembly term, informed the development of the national mission. The second review, conducted at the end of 2019, will be published in March 2020. The OECD's involvement is part of the Welsh Government's commitment to external verification and self-evaluation of the education system.\n\nThe School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013 grants local authorities extensive powers of intervention in schools. Some local authorities have used these powers, while others have not. The effectiveness of the legislation varies across authorities. The Welsh Government has not used its intervention powers to date, preferring to encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach.\n\nThe national evaluation and improvement resource, formerly known as the national evaluation and improvement toolkit, plays a significant role in raising school standards. It is designed to support self-evaluation in schools and aligns with the national mission. The resource is currently in the testing phase and will be implemented in September 2020.\n\nThe investment in school standards has been focused on professional learning for teaching professionals. This investment is based on evidence and supports the development of skills within the education system.\n\nThe identification of schools in need of support or challenge is determined through various systems, including the school categorisation system and Estyn inspection reports. The school categorisation system primarily identifies schools for targeted support, while Estyn inspections hold schools accountable for their practice. The categorisation system has evolved over time and will continue to change to align with curriculum reform and self-evaluation.\n\nThere is a need to improve the identification of schools causing significant concern and provide early support. The Welsh Government is piloting a new multi-agency approach for schools causing concern, where a panel of stakeholders works with the school to support improvement. This approach aims to address the issue of schools not being identified early enough and is currently being evaluated. The government is also exploring the use of additional data, such as staff sickness and pupil movement, to identify schools in need of support earlier.",
        "In the meeting, the opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance of individual institutions were discussed. Sharon Davies expressed concern about the reluctance of local authorities to intervene in struggling schools and questioned whether they lacked the necessary tools and support. Kirsty Williams AM acknowledged the need for a more coordinated and strategic approach to school improvement, emphasizing the importance of self-evaluation and addressing underlying challenges. \n\nDuring the meeting, Sian Gwenllian AM inquired about quality assurance and how Kirsty Williams AM responded to her question. Sian Gwenllian AM asked about the usefulness of PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) in helping school improvement. Kirsty Williams AM acknowledged the importance of PISA as one of many tools used to assess the performance of the education system. She also mentioned the need for a broader range of data and statistics to get a comprehensive picture of education performance. \n\nThe meeting also touched on the issue of closing the attainment gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and those who are not eligible. Kirsty Williams AM recognized the persistent challenge and emphasized the need for targeted support and interventions. She highlighted the progress made in some areas, such as the performance of girls on free school meals, but acknowledged that more work needs to be done. \n\nOverall, the meeting provided insights into the opinions and discussions surrounding the role of local authorities in quality assurance, the usefulness of PISA in school improvement, and the ongoing efforts to address the attainment gap in education.",
        "In the meeting, the opinions of Sharon Davies and Kirsty Williams AM on the role of local authorities in quality assurance of individual institutions were not explicitly discussed. The meeting primarily focused on the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales. However, Sian Gwenllian AM inquired about quality assurance and Kirsty Williams AM responded by discussing the importance of considering the safety and well-being of children and staff when making decisions about reopening schools. Kirsty Williams AM also mentioned that they are working with representatives from the higher education sector to ensure their inclusion in the decision-making process.\n\nRegarding vocational learners, it was mentioned that Qualifications Wales has provided clarity on how assessments will be managed for Essential Skills Wales qualifications and health and social care qualifications. However, there may be a delay for technical qualifications that require a certificate of competency.\n\nIn terms of A-level and GCSE qualifications, Kirsty Williams AM stated that teachers will be asked to submit grades they believe students would have obtained if exams had taken place, and the grades will be moderated to ensure fairness. The moratorium on unconditional offers is in place until 1 May, and discussions are ongoing with UCAS and other UK counterparts to support students during this time.\n\nRegarding higher and further education, efforts are being made to support students who are transitioning to college or university. The Hwb platform provides resources and courses for year 13 students to prepare for university, and there are also resources available for GCSE students. The issue of maintenance loan grants for students living at home and potential reimbursement for accommodation costs was addressed by stating that there will be no change to student support payments for those living at home, and conversations are ongoing to provide further support to students who may have been affected by the pandemic.\n\nIn terms of funding for universities, the Welsh Government is working closely with Universities Wales and HEFCW to provide stability and flexibility in the use of resources.

        "According to Estyn, the use of the Pupil Development Grant (PDG) has improved over time, with schools now targeting it more effectively towards children eligible for free school meals. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of targeting the funding exclusively towards these children. There is also a need to focus on more able and talented students who are eligible for free school meals, as they often do not receive the support they need. Estyn suggests that the PDG should be used to address attendance issues, engage with families and the community, and improve the curriculum and teaching quality. The effectiveness of the PDG in narrowing the attainment gap between students on free school meals and their peers is difficult to determine, but there have been some small improvements. Estyn also highlights the unintended consequences of performance measures that discourage the availability of vocational qualifications, such as BTECs, which may be suitable for certain students. Finally, there is a need for better awareness and understanding of the PDG among schools, particularly in relation to looked-after and adopted children.",

        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector were discussed in a meeting with David Blaney, the chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), and Bethan Owen, the deputy chief executive of HEFCW. The financial challenges facing the sector result from three main causes: the impact of a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and increased costs in general. The uncertainty surrounding the Augar review in England and Brexit also contribute to the challenges. These challenges are not unique to Wales and are being faced by universities across the UK.\n\nBefore the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a funding gap between England and Wales, and Welsh higher education institutions are still approximately \u00a340 million worse off than their counterparts in England. The introduction of the Diamond reforms, which increase funding for higher education in Wales, is important in addressing these financial challenges. The performance of the sector in Wales is generally good, with high student satisfaction and impactful research. However, the financial challenges are affecting the capacity of institutions to deliver for Wales, and there are concerns about the impact on staff well-being.\n\nIn terms of university reserves, while universities have reserves, a significant portion of those reserves is tied up in their estates and not immediately realizable. The operating cash generated by universities is also lower compared to English institutions. Universities have been investing in their estates through borrowings, and the costs of those borrowings are increasing, which affects their operating cash. While there are no plans to close departments or pull the rug out from under continuing students, the financial challenges may lead to more job losses and a reduction in capacity. The governing bodies of universities play a crucial role in overseeing the financial management and decision-making of institutions. HEFCW monitors the financial performance of institutions through forecasting and regular meetings.\n\nThe allocation of funding for the 2019-20 academic year includes an increase in recurrent teaching funding, maintained funding for research, increased support for expensive and higher-cost subjects, and funding for collaboration between higher education and further education. There is a need for increased openness and transparency in reporting the use of fee income, and efforts will be made to improve the accessibility of information on income and expenditure.\n\nRegarding part-time student funding, there has been an increase in part-time student numbers in Wales compared to the rest of the UK. Funding has been allocated to support part-time provision, and there are plans to continue supporting and funding growth in part-time provision. The sustainability of part-time student funding within current arrangements will be assessed, and work will be done to prioritize Diamond funding.\n\nIn terms of research funding, there are concerns about the lack of increase in QR funding, which is important for sustaining and growing the research base in Wales. The funding allocation for 2019-20 does not increase QR funding, but efforts will be made to encourage universities to develop educational research. The allocation of funding to Wales for research is smaller compared to",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector include the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its impact on EU student recruitment and funding. The decrease in EU student applications, as well as the decrease in non-EU international student applications, can be attributed to factors such as changes in student support arrangements and the perceived attractiveness of the institutions and the country. The Welsh higher education sector is also facing financial pressures due to the implementation of the recommendations from the Diamond review, which will take time to fully implement. Other challenges include pay and pension costs, increased student expectations for modern facilities, and the potential consequences of the review of fees and funding in England. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) works with the sector to monitor their financial forecasts and sustainability plans, and provides advice and guidance based on data and information available. The sector is also taking steps to address the impact of Brexit, such as strengthening marketing efforts to attract international students and advocating for continued access to EU research funding. The HEFCW is confident that the institutions are taking a robust approach to planning for Brexit and are prepared to make necessary adjustments to ensure their sustainability.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector include a decline in teacher training applications, a decrease in the number of students studying through the medium of Welsh, and a reduction in funding for part-time provision. The Welsh government is taking steps to address these challenges by improving teacher training programs, offering financial incentives, and implementing a national recruitment campaign. The government is also committed to the reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector, with a focus on creating a new commission that will promote collaboration and strengthen links between institutions. Additionally, the government is working to ensure that universities are investing in initiatives that promote equality and opportunity for underrepresented groups. However, further analysis and research are needed to assess the effectiveness of these initiatives and ensure that they are leading to better outcomes for students.",
        "The main pressures, barriers, and causes for the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are varied. One issue is the need to ensure access and affordability for students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This includes addressing the cost of tuition fees and providing adequate financial support, such as grants and scholarships, to help students cover their expenses.\n\nAnother pressure is the need to improve outcomes and destinations for learners. This involves tracking the progress and success of students in terms of their academic performance and employment opportunities after graduation. This requires better data collection and analysis, as well as collaboration between higher education institutions and other organizations.\n\nThe financial challenges also stem from the need to invest in infrastructure and resources to provide high-quality education and research facilities. This includes funding for new buildings, equipment, and technology, as well as support for research projects and staff development.\n\nAdditionally, there is a need to address the issue of mergers and reconfigurations within the higher education sector. While there may be potential benefits to collaboration and consolidation, there can also be challenges and disruptions to staff and students. It is important to carefully consider the impact and feasibility of such mergers.\n\nThe financial challenges also include the need to address issues related to pay and pensions for staff in higher education institutions. Ensuring fair and competitive salaries and benefits is crucial for attracting and retaining talented faculty and staff.\n\nOverall, the financial challenges facing the Welsh higher education sector are complex and multifaceted. They require a comprehensive and coordinated approach that addresses issues related to access, affordability, outcomes, infrastructure, staff, and other factors. It is important for the Welsh government, higher education institutions, and other stakeholders to work together to find sustainable solutions to these challenges."

        "During the meeting, Dr. David Blaney, Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, discussed the impact of Brexit on the higher education system in Wales. He stated that uncertainty about the relationships and arrangements with Europe is a significant concern for university management. The potential drop in EU students applying to study in Wales was also discussed, with a decrease of 8% in EU applicants to Welsh institutions compared to a 2% increase for English institutions. Dr. Blaney mentioned that changes in student support arrangements for EU students, as well as the relative level of investment in facilities and infrastructure, could be factors contributing to this decline. He also highlighted the importance of promoting Wales as a safe and attractive place to study.\n\nIn terms of financial pressures on the higher education sector, Dr. Blaney mentioned the funding position as a main concern. He stated that the implementation of the Diamond recommendations, which aim to re-establish funding for higher cost provision and innovation, is crucial to the sector's sustainability. However, the timing and amount of funding to be received are still uncertain. Bethan Owen, Director of Institutional Engagement, added that universities are trying to minimize cost reductions while waiting for the funding to be implemented.\n\nThe potential impact on fee and access plans was also discussed. The decrease in EU student applications could affect fee income, and institutions may need to revise their plans accordingly. The importance of investment in capital infrastructure to attract students and compete with English universities was highlighted.\n\nRegarding research funding, Dr. Blaney emphasized the need for increased investment in the research base in Wales. He mentioned the deficit in STEM areas and the importance of having enough researchers and competitive core research funding to access UK-wide research pots. The potential impact of Brexit on researcher collaborations and networks was also mentioned, with the need to continue playing a role in European collaborative activities.\n\nOverall, Dr. Blaney expressed concerns about the uncertainty and potential challenges that Brexit could pose to the higher education sector in Wales. He highlighted the need for continued investment, promotion of Wales as an attractive study destination, and support for research and innovation to ensure the sustainability and competitiveness of Welsh universities.",
        "During the meeting, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and the Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning discussed the impact of Brexit on higher education in Wales, including the drop in EU students applying to study in Wales. Dr. David Blaney, the Chief Executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), also provided insights on the financial sustainability of the higher education sector in Wales.\n\nDr. Blaney highlighted several challenges facing universities in Wales, including a demographic dip in 18-year-olds, increased pension costs, and uncertainty surrounding the Augar review in England and Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales and many UK universities are taking steps to manage their finances.\n\nThe funding gap between Wales and England is another issue impacting the financial sustainability of Welsh universities. Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off compared to their English counterparts. However, Dr. Blaney noted that this was a result of a political decision to invest in students rather than universities.\n\nDespite these challenges, Dr. Blaney emphasized that the situation is being managed and there is no crisis in the sector. However, he acknowledged that taking measures to reduce costs can have a negative impact on the capacity of universities.\n\nIn terms of EU students, the drop in applications from EU students in Wales was attributed to the change in government policy regarding student support. Previously, EU students were eligible for a tuition fee grant, but this option is no longer available. The change in policy was anticipated to have an impact on EU recruitment.\n\nTo address these issues, the Welsh Government has allocated additional funding to HEFCW to support the sector in dealing with demographic changes and the impact of Brexit. They are also working on initiatives to boost international marketing of the higher education sector and attract more international students to Wales.\n\nOverall, while there are financial challenges and uncertainties in the higher education sector in Wales, the Welsh Government and HEFCW are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Diamond and Reid reviews and supporting the sustainability of the sector.",
        "Dr. David Blaney's opinion on the impact of Brexit on Wales' higher education system is that it will have a negative effect, particularly on the drop in EU students applying to study in Wales. He believes that Brexit will result in a decrease in capacity and a reduction in the range of curriculum, research, and innovation that universities can offer. This will have a long-term impact on the ability of universities to deliver for Wales.\n\nHowever, Dr. Blaney also highlights the importance of the Diamond reforms in mitigating some of the negative impacts of Brexit. He mentions that the Diamond money is coming in and that there will be an increase in resources for higher education in Wales. He also highlights the positive performance of the sector, with Wales being the best in the UK in terms of the national student survey results and research impact.\n\nIn terms of attracting prospective students to study in Wales, Dr. Blaney emphasizes the quality of higher education in Wales and the support and care that students receive. He also mentions the importance of the Welsh government's investment in the sector and the commitment to providing affordable accommodation and support for under-represented groups.\n\nOverall, while there are challenges and uncertainties due to Brexit, Dr. Blaney is confident that the institutions are managing the situation and that there will not be any institution falling over in the foreseeable future. However, he acknowledges the need for continued monitoring and support to ensure the sustainability of the higher education sector in Wales."

        "During the meeting, there was a discussion about the issues with HMRC and the decision made regarding them, including Julie Morgan's perspective. The meeting began with Lynne Neagle AM welcoming everyone and receiving apologies for absence. The first question was posed by Janet Finch-Saunders AM, who raised concerns about the opposition to the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Julie Morgan AM responded by explaining that the Bill is not about child abuse, but rather about prohibiting all forms of physical punishment in order to protect children's rights. She acknowledged that people have different views on the matter but emphasized the importance of hearing those views. She also mentioned that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognizes that any physical punishment of children is incompatible with their human rights. Julie Morgan AM expressed confidence in the updated law making it clearer for parents and those working with children. Janet Finch-Saunders AM then asked about the use of gentle taps or smacks as a disciplinary tool and how the government intends to work with parents going forward. Julie Morgan AM responded by stating that there is no place for physical punishment in bringing up children and that there are other ways to help parents discipline their children. She mentioned that the government is confident in its decision to update the law and that it will be implemented in a practical and workable way. The discussion then shifted to the impact of the Bill on social services and the workload of social workers. Julie Morgan AM acknowledged the concerns raised by social workers about the potential increase in workload but stated that the evidence from other countries shows that social services have not been overwhelmed by similar legislation. She mentioned that ongoing evaluation and monitoring will be conducted to assess the impact of the legislation and address any issues that arise. The conversation then moved on to the role of schools in implementing the Bill. Julie Morgan AM stated that teachers will receive training on how to respond to incidents of physical punishment and that the education sector is represented on the implementation group.

        "The WISERD research findings and concerns raised by Estyn regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system were discussed in the meeting. The research indicated that the pupil development grant (PDG) has been targeted better over time, but there are still issues with the targeting of the funding specifically towards children eligible for free school meals. The research also highlighted that more able and talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be missing out on the grant. The meeting discussed the need for schools to better identify and support these students. It was noted that schools are using the grant to track progress, improve attendance, work with families and the community, improve exam results, and enhance students' confidence and engagement. However, there were concerns raised about the overemphasis on key stage 4 and the need for a more sustainable, long-term approach to improving student outcomes. The meeting also touched on the challenges of engaging with parents and the community, the impact of changes to performance measures, and the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Overall, it was acknowledged that the education system is undergoing significant changes and that progress is being made, but there is still work to be done to ensure all students have equal opportunities for success.",
        "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is still involved in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey. They conducted a rapid review of Welsh education at the beginning of the Assembly term, which informed the publication of the national mission. The OECD is now reviewing the progress made against the national mission, and their report is expected to be published in March. The national evaluation and improvement resource plays a significant role in raising school standards. It is a tool for self-evaluation that has been developed in collaboration with the OECD, middle-tier organizations, and practitioners. The resource aims to support schools in identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. The effectiveness of the investment in school standards is difficult to measure, as it is part of a complex education budget. However, 50% of the investment has been directed towards professional learning for teachers, which is seen as a crucial factor in improving school standards. The School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013 gives local authorities extensive powers of intervention in schools. Some local authorities have used these powers effectively, while others have not. The Welsh Government has not used these powers to date, as it believes that local authorities are best placed to intervene in schools. The national categorization system is used to identify schools that need support or intervention. The system has evolved over time and will continue to evolve to align with curriculum reform and changes in self-evaluation. The system is primarily used for triaging resources and identifying where support is needed. The Welsh Government is piloting a new multi-agency approach to supporting schools that are causing concern. This approach involves a multi-agency panel working with the school to identify areas for improvement and provide support. The pilot is being evaluated by Cardiff Metropolitan University and Swansea University. The Welsh Government is also exploring new ways of identifying schools that need support, such as monitoring staff sickness and other forms of data analysis. The aim is to intervene earlier and provide support to schools before they reach a crisis point. The government acknowledges that there is still work to be done in identifying and supporting schools that are causing concern.",
        "The WISERD research findings highlighted concerns regarding the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. The research indicated that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds faced disadvantages and challenges that affected their educational outcomes. The findings emphasized the need for targeted interventions and support to address these issues.\n\nDuring the meeting, various concerns were raised about the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds. The participants discussed the lack of coordination and self-evaluation in the education system, as well as the need for a collective effort to address the challenges faced by students. The variation across different local authorities and the need for consistency in addressing the issues were also highlighted.\n\nThe participants discussed the importance of identifying problems early and providing support to students at an early stage. They also emphasized the need for a multi-agency approach and the involvement of regional school improvement services in addressing the challenges faced by students from different socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nThe meeting also touched upon the categorization system and its relevance in evaluating the performance and resilience of students. The participants discussed the need for a more sophisticated approach and the possibility of moving away from the current system of categorization.\n\nOverall, the meeting highlighted the concerns raised by the WISERD research and the need for targeted interventions and support to improve the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. The participants emphasized the importance of a coordinated and collective effort to address these challenges and ensure the success of all students.",
        "In the meeting, concerns were raised about the performance and resilience of students from different socio-economic backgrounds in the education system. The findings and concerns raised by WISERD research were discussed. It was noted that there is a need to address the performance gap between students from different socio-economic backgrounds, particularly in secondary schools. The meeting also highlighted the importance of leadership and the quality of teaching and learning in addressing these concerns. It was suggested that a long-term solution is needed to improve the quality of teaching and learning, and that the new curriculum in Wales is a step in the right direction. Short-term solutions such as providing more support to schools causing concern were also discussed. The meeting emphasized the importance of community schools and the involvement of parents in the education system. The financial situation and the allocation of funding were also discussed, with suggestions that additional funding could be used to support teacher training and the implementation of the new curriculum.

        "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. The Deputy Minister explained that her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment. She also mentioned that she had considered other amendments related to the duty to raise awareness, but found them unnecessary or duplicative. \n\nIn response to the committee's recommendation, the Deputy Minister committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from Royal Assent if the Bill is passed. She explained that the campaign would be comprehensive and reach all communities, and that specific groups did not need to be highlighted on the face of the Bill. She also stated that the duty to promote awareness among children was unnecessary as children's rights were already prioritized in policy making. The Deputy Minister emphasized that the Bill aimed to remove a defence to an existing criminal offence, and therefore did not require provisions on how to raise concerns about physical punishment.\n\nRegarding the duty to report on the effect of the legislation, the Deputy Minister introduced amendment 2 to put a duty on Welsh Ministers to undertake a post-implementation review of the Bill. She explained that the review would be a continuous program of work, including attitudinal surveys and data collection, to track changes in public attitudes and monitor the effectiveness of the awareness-raising campaign. The Deputy Minister argued against amendment 2C, which would require a report on the awareness-raising campaign before section 1 commences, stating that it was unnecessary and could disrupt the implementation of the Bill. She assured the committee that the effectiveness of the campaign would be assessed and shared with the committee through various methods.\n\nIn response to the committee's concerns about the reporting period, the Deputy Minister offered to provide an interim report before section 1 commences, and to consult with the committee on its contents. She acknowledged the importance of evaluating the impact of the Bill and stated that all areas of interest raised by the committee would be considered. The Deputy Minister also expressed willingness to discuss amendments 2D and 2E to address concerns about the reporting period and the laying of the report. She urged the committee to reject the non-Government amendments and agree to her amendments 2 and 5, which she believed achieved the same policy aim without unnecessary detail on the face of the Bill.",
        "The Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. She explained that the aim of the Bill is to prohibit all forms of physical punishment in order to protect children's rights. While she understands that people have different views on the matter, she believes that physical punishment is incompatible with children's human rights. She also emphasized that the legislation is not about addressing child abuse, but rather about promoting a culture of non-violence towards children.\n\nIn terms of implementation, the Deputy Minister acknowledged that there are concerns about issues such as malicious reporting, the public interest test, and out-of-hours provision from social services. However, she assured that these issues are being addressed by the implementation group, which consists of representatives from various agencies involved in child protection. She also mentioned ongoing evaluation and monitoring to assess the impact of the legislation and ensure that it is being implemented effectively.\n\nRegarding the impact on social services, the Deputy Minister stated that the threshold for intervention will not change and that social services already receive and investigate reports of physical punishment. She cited evidence from the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, which indicated that they do not anticipate a significant increase in referrals as a result of the legislation.\n\nIn terms of multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs), the Deputy Minister stated that the effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on them. While she acknowledged that MASHs can be beneficial in facilitating joint working between social services and the police, she noted that there are already well-established mechanisms in place for this collaboration. She mentioned that there are currently MASHs in certain areas of Wales, but their operation may vary.",

        "During the meeting, the Deputy Minister addressed her amendments in different groups regarding the duty to promote public awareness, report on the effect of the legislation, and regulation-making powers in the Bill. The Deputy Minister emphasized the need for clarity and the importance of the rights of the child in the proposed changes. The witnesses from various organizations, including the Association of Directors of Social Services and the Association of Directors of Education Wales, expressed their support for the Bill and the clarity it would bring to the issue of physical punishment of children. They highlighted the harmful effects of physical punishment on children and the potential for it to escalate into more serious forms of abuse. The witnesses also emphasized the need for greater clarity in the definition of corporal punishment and the importance of simplicity in the Bill. They agreed that further discussion and implementation phase would be necessary to address any concerns and ensure effective implementation of the legislation. In terms of the impact on social services, the witnesses acknowledged the potential for increased referrals and the need for additional resources to support the implementation of the Bill.
