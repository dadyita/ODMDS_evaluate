They also discussed the possibility of using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point. They agreed on the target market being 15 to 35-year-olds with more money than sense, who are decision-makers. They also discussed the desired functions of the remote control, including volume, power, numbers, enter, channels, and easy usability. \n\nDuring the meeting, the User Interface team presented their thoughts on the cost constraints, financial targets, and replacement of kinetic batteries in the new remote control project. They discussed the current cost of competition devices, which ranged from 20 to 60 Euros, and how their target price of 12.5 Pence was well within the market range. They also discussed the possibility of using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point. The team agreed that the remote control should have a simple mass-produced design and should incorporate the corporate design and slogan. They also discussed the desired functions of the remote control, including volume, power, numbers, enter, channels, and easy usability. The team agreed to further research the cost, ergonomics, and feasibility of the various possibilities discussed.",
        "During the meeting, the User Interface (UI) team expressed their thoughts on the cost constraints, financial targets, and replacement of kinetic batteries in the new remote control project. The Industrial Designer presented different options for the components of the remote control, such as the circuit board, integrated circuit (chip), diodes, transistors, resonators, resistors, and capacitors. They also discussed the possibility of using a hand-powered dynamo, kinetic energy, or solar power as the energy source for the remote control. The UI team mentioned that they preferred rubber as the casing material for its ergonomic design, and the Marketing team mentioned the importance of making the remote control look cool and technologically innovative. They also discussed the idea of incorporating fruit and veg or spongy materials into the design. The UI team suggested using an LCD display and customizable menu structure, and the Marketing team mentioned the possibility of including a USB connection for programming the remote control. The team agreed that the remote control should be international and have options for different languages and colors. They also discussed the idea of including a slogan and a distinctive color, such as yellow, to promote the company's brand. The team concluded the meeting by discussing the next steps, including prototyping, further design decisions, and product evaluation.",
        "In the meeting, the User Interface discussed their thoughts on the cost constraints, financial targets, and replacement of kinetic batteries in the new remote control project. They mentioned that the shape and ergonomics of the remote control were important considerations. They also discussed the materials that could be used, such as metal or rubber, with a preference for rubber due to its anti-RSI properties. They considered the different types of buttons and the possibility of using a scroll button. The User Interface also mentioned the possibility of incorporating a kinetic energy source in the remote control, as it would be innovative and environmentally friendly. They discussed the design of the casing, including the use of rubber and interchangeable plates. They also mentioned the need for a regular chip for the buttons and the possibility of incorporating lighting in the remote control. The User Interface also discussed the concept of the user interface, focusing on a command line interface. They mentioned the importance of simplicity and user-friendliness in the design. Finally, they discussed the trend of using fruit and vegetable themes in fashion, and the possibility of incorporating that into the design of the remote control."
