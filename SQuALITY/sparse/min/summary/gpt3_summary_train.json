The Bogans, who are known as the Hoodlums of the Nicodemean Cluster, have a history of launching military campaigns. However, the hope is that their participation in the Exchange Program will help redirect their aggression into more cultivated channels.\n\nThe Bogans are sending two thousand students to d'Land, an industrial world.

However, it is unclear what they will study on d'Land, which is primarily an industrial world of the poor but honest variety.\n\nRetief, the protagonist, is tasked with managing the administrative routine of the Exchange Program during Second Secretary Magnan's absence. Magnan hopes that Retief will practice diplomatic restraint and not antagonize the Bogan representative.\n\nMeanwhile, Retief encounters a man named Hank from Lovenbroy who is facing difficulties with his vineyards. Hank had hocked the vineyards, expecting to repay the loan in twelve years. However, if they don't get a big grape harvest, Croanie will step in and take over the land. Hank seeks Retief's help, hoping that the Cultural Exchange Program could provide a loan to hire extra hands for the harvest. However, Retief explains that their role is to work out itineraries for traveling side-shows and that he cannot help with Hank's request.\n\nDuring a council meeting, Retief learns that Croanie, a troublemaker, is receiving heavy mining equipment from the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and Exchanges. This information surprises Retief, as Croanie holds a mortgage on the vineyards in Lovenbroy.

    "The story of Thig unfolds with him completing a report on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. Torp, his superior, praises him for locating three worlds fit for colonization. However, Torp recommends the conquest of one of the planets, 72-P-3, and the complete destruction of all biped life on it. Thig questions this approach and suggests disarming and exiling the natives instead, believing it is their duty to help them attain knowledge and comfort. Torp angrily dismisses Thig's suggestion, emphasizing that the good of the Horde is all that matters. Thig, frustrated, expresses his desire to never set foot on Earth again, feeling that there are forces at work there that the people of Ortha have forgotten.\n\nTorp orders Kam to check Thig's blood for disease, suspecting that his irrational words may be a result of fever or illness. While Kam examines him, Torp blasts off for Ortha. In the laboratory, Thig contemplates the instruments and gauges, particularly the decomposition blaster, which can disintegrate flesh or vegetation. The ship takes off, and Thig realizes that he must return to Earth to be with Ellen, a woman who needs him. He believes that the Horde should find another empty world, as Earth is not suitable for them.\n\nThig pleads to turn back, but Kam, suspicious of his behavior, prepares to sedate him. Thig goes berserk and attacks Kam, choking him and fighting for control of his blaster. They struggle for the fate of the world until Thig finally overpowers Kam, leaving him unconscious. Thig discovers an Earthman, Terry, who resembles him, and Torp suggests transferring Terry's memories and knowledge to Thig's brain using a psychic relay. Thig agrees, and after the procedure, he disguises himself as an Earthman and plans to scout the planet while Torp and Kam explore the inner planets.\n\nThig returns to his home on Earth, where he encounters his family and his mate, Ellen. He feels warmth and love, emotions that are foreign to him as a member of the Horde. Meanwhile, Kam regains consciousness and confronts Torp, ultimately killing him with the decomposition blaster. Kam then attacks Thig, but Thig manages to overpower him once again. Thig realizes that his actions have doomed Earth and contemplates his impending death. However, Kam relentlessly beats him until someone else intervenes, saving Thig's life.\n\nIn summary, the story of Thig revolves around his journey as a member of the Horde from Ortha to Earth. It explores his conflicting beliefs and the consequences of his actions as he struggles with the duty to his people and the love he discovers on Earth. The story also delves into the ruthless nature of the Horde and the impact of their colonization efforts on other civilizations.",

Thig's mission is to capture a native Earthling and extract their knowledge to determine if Earth is suitable for colonization by the Orthan horde. Thig encounters an Earthman and successfully captures him. However, during the process, Thig's consciousness is somehow transferred into the body of the Earthman, Lewis Terry. As Lewis, he must now navigate the complexities of human emotions and relationships, all while maintaining the facade of being Lewis Terry and protecting the happiness of his family. The story ends with Lewis, now fully embracing his new identity, contemplating writing about his experiences and the other worlds he has seen.",
    "In the story \"Quest of Thig,\" the customs of Ortha and those that Thig encounters on Earth, specifically in Connecticut, contrast greatly. Thig is from Ortha, a planet that is part of the conquering HORDE. Thig and his fellow Orthans have been sent to Earth to determine if it is suitable for colonization by their people. The Orthans have a mission to drain the knowledge from the minds of the native Earthlings to assess the planet's suitability.\n\nThe customs of Ortha are described as highly ordered and devoid of emotions. The Orthans have no clothing except for the necessary belts and straps to hold their weapons and supplies. They are trained from childhood to serve the Horde and have no concept of love, affection, or personal relationships. Their society is solely focused on the growth and power of the Horde.\n\nOn Earth, Thig encounters a completely different set of customs. Earth is described as a paradise among planets, with plenty of sunlight, water, and a dense atmosphere. The Earthlings, or \"primitive humans\" as Thig refers to them, have emotions and personal relationships. Thig encounters an Earthman who resembles him in appearance, but their customs and way of life are vastly different.\n\nThig's commander, Torp, believes that the Earthlings should be eliminated for the good of the Horde. He sees their emotions and mental aberrations as potential complications. Thig, on the other hand, questions this approach. He suggests disarming the Earthlings and helping them attain knowledge and comfort, similar to how the Orthans have evolved. However, Torp dismisses this idea, asserting that the Horde's superiority gives them the right to take over the planet.\n\nAs the story progresses, Thig becomes conflicted and starts to question the actions of the Horde. He falls in love with an Earthwoman named Ellen and realizes that there are forces at work on Earth that the Orthans have forgotten. Thig's love for Ellen and his desire to protect her lead him to defy his commander and go back to Earth.\n\nIn the end, Thig is transformed into an Earthman through a process of transferring memories and knowledge from a captured Earthman's brain to his own. He returns to Earth, disguising himself as an Earthman, and reunites with Ellen and her children. Thig's experiences on Earth make him realize the importance of love, affection, and personal relationships, which are absent in the customs of Ortha.\n\nOverall, the customs of Ortha, focused solely on the growth and power of the Horde, contrast with the emotions and personal relationships that Thig encounters on Earth. Thig's journey on Earth challenges his beliefs and leads him to question the actions of the Horde.",
    "In the story \"Quest of Thig,\" Ellen influences Thig's decisions in his quest to explore and conquer Earth. Thig, an Orthan from another planet, initially believes that Earth is a perfect world for colonization and intends to report this to his fellow Orthans. However, Ellen's presence and their experiences together on Earth cause Thig to question the idea of destroying Earth's civilization to make room for the Orthan Hordes. Thig is drawn to the emotions and complexities of human life that he has witnessed during his time on Earth. He has learned to think for himself and make his own decisions, and he begins to see the value in the diversity and uncertainty of human existence. Ellen's influence makes Thig realize that the destruction of Earth and its people is unnecessary and that there is more to humanity than blind devotion to the Horde. As a result, Thig decides to go against his fellow Orthans and advocate for the preservation of Earth and its inhabitants.",

Harvey justifies his actions by explaining that he needed to use the bitter water to manufacture the remedy and maintain their profit. Joe expresses his dissatisfaction with being used as a guinea pig, but Harvey assures him that they will get back their money from Johnson and even profit further by selling the peculiar creature they encountered to a zoo.\n\nIn summary, Harvey and Joe encounter the deceptive tactics of Angus Johnson, the mayor of Planetoid 42.

    "In the story \"Bodyguard,\" the zarquil games are mentioned as a form of entertainment that is fabulously expensive and profitable for the Vinzz, who run them. The Vinzz are creatures from Altair's seventh planet who are only interested in making money and buying slaves. The zarquil games are compared to the terrestrial game of musical chairs, as they involve the concept of bodies being of little account, similar to how in Vinau (the Vinzz's home planet), bodies are not valued. \n\nThe zarquil operators are occasionally apprehended, but due to their strange powers and long lifespans, they are not easily punished by Earth courts. It is uncertain whether the weapons of the Earthlings can even kill the Vinzz, or if they simply expire out of boredom after a certain number of years. Despite this, there has always been peace between Vinau and Terra (Earth), so the entrance of seemingly respectable citizens from Vinau cannot be barred. \n\nThe fat man in the story visits a zarquil house in a seedy locale and encounters a small green creature who asks if he wants to play.

Halden is a biologist and Meredith is a linguist. They, along with Emmer, an archeologist, and Kelburn, a mathematician, represent different aspects of human development and fertility.\n\nThe team discovers ruins of a highly advanced civilization that covered a vast distance in a short amount of time. These beings, referred to as the \"unknown ancestor,\" were long-lived and had a faster-than-light drive. It is believed that they modified their own germ plasm to create the different human races.\n\nMeredith and Halden are part of this expedition to gain knowledge about their origins and the culture of the unknown ancestor. They are interested in cultural discoveries, learning about how their ancestors lived, and the advanced biology of the unknown ancestor.\n\nTaphetta, a Ribboneer pilot, is initially skeptical of the expedition's purpose but eventually agrees to help.

He just wants to have a meal at his own table, be with his family, and see some old friends. He is not eager to talk about his journey yet, as there is very little to tell. He compares his voyage to the voyages of great mariners, with long, dull periods of time passing until the arrival.\n\nBased on these stories, the captain in \"The Giants Return\" perceives the journey and homecoming with excitement and hope, while the first man in \"The First One\" perceives it with weariness and a desire for normalcy.",

They are searching for recruits, like the protagonist Ben, who can help them in their mission and contribute to their efforts in exploring unexplored space. The journey serves as a means to achieve their goal of returning to Earth and building a new future for themselves.",
    "In the story \"The Giants Return,\" the reason behind the captain's choice to head back to Earth instead of proceeding to Omega Centauri is twofold. Firstly, the captain acknowledges that their exploration of thousands of stars has yielded no promising results in finding a suitable home for humanity. While there is hope that Omega Centauri, a globular cluster with a hundred thousand stars, may hold the planets they seek, it is located twenty thousand light years away. Even if they were able to reach it, the journey would take so long that returning to Earth after more than forty thousand years would be pointless, as their civilization and perhaps even the human race itself would have likely perished from memory.\n\nAdditionally, the planners of the mission limited the voyage to less than a thousand years Earth time due to sociodynamic predictions that their civilization would reach an unstable phase and potentially collapse from overpopulation. Returning to Earth with news of their failure would serve no purpose, as the decree that governed their mission was five thousand years old, its makers were dead, and it may have been forgotten back on Earth.\n\nAlthough some crew members still show signs of homesickness, the captain ultimately decides to head back to Earth. The reasons behind this decision are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the captain values the importance of Earth as their home, despite the potential hardships and uncertainties they may face upon their return. The captain's choice may also be influenced by a sense of loyalty to their civilization and a desire to be reunited with familiar surroundings, even if they are drastically changed.",

    "The story revolves around a character named Joe who is confronted by Hendricks, who asks for Joe's CPA ID. Joe realizes that conspiracy to commit a crime is not considered a crime itself, but the function of the CPA (Central Protection Agency) is to prevent crimes from happening. The CPA does not punish crimes or attempt to prevent them through punishment, as that would be a violation of the New Civil Rights. Instead, the CPA functions by preventing crimes from occurring. Hendricks upgrades Joe's ID to indicate that he now has \"Dangerous Criminal Tendencies\" and is a DCT First Class. Hendricks explains that Joe's case history will be turned over to the newspapers, making him the subject of amateur cops' interest. These amateur cops watch First Class individuals like Joe in the hopes of preventing them from committing a crime and gaining fame and rewards.

This frustrates Joe, as he is unable to act on his impulses or express his true thoughts and emotions. He becomes determined to expose the CPA's procedures to the public and tell his story to the newspapers.\n\nIn a conversation with Hendricks, a CPA employee, Joe suggests that Hendricks frame him for a crime, as both of them want to see him convicted. However, Hendricks explains that convicting an innocent person is a violation of civil rights and a crime itself. Despite their shared desire, Hendricks cannot assist Joe without committing a crime.\n\nHendricks then offers Joe an opportunity to commit a crime indirectly. He shows Joe a book containing names and addresses of people who are not properly protected by the CPA's anti-robbery devices. Hendricks cannot directly instruct Joe to rob someone, as that would be a crime, but he hints at the possibility. Joe takes advantage of the situation and memorizes the name and address of a potential victim.\n\nJoe's decision to employ the girl is driven by his desperation and desire to rebel against the CPA's control. He sees this as an opportunity to prove that the CPA's system is flawed and that he can still commit a crime despite their efforts to prevent it.

DCTs are required to carry a CPA ID card and show it upon request. This identification immediately reveals their criminal tendencies and makes it difficult for them to find employment. They are often limited to low-paying jobs like garbage man, street-cleaner, or ditch-digger.\n\nThe protagonist, Joe, frustrated by the limitations imposed on him due to his DCT status, comes up with a plan. He wants to commit a crime and get convicted so that he can undergo the CPA Treatment and become an Ex.
