    "Janis is the wife of Alec. She is described as tall and tanned, with a few freckles, like him, and wavy red hair, like his. She ignored the brightly-humorous blue eyes. In other words, she said, everyone on the planet looks like you andme. She turned her head away and tried to let go, but the handle was caught in her glove. She looked up and I saw it was Alec, my nurse-wife. She was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to think. She pointed to the stalled cars. Are you really all right? Of course I'm all right. But why.... The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother'snumber and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced and it came from our phone here. I kept calling up, but I only got abusy signal. Oh, dear, are you sure you\u2019re okay? I put my arm around her and glanced at McGill. He had an inward look. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious castto it. When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. Explain to Molly, I said. I\u2019m not properly briefed yet. He did so, but when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was a jump ahead of him. He\u2019s not doing so well, he confessed. But so far as I can see, Molly answered, it's mere probability, and without any over-all pattern. Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center. He sees the gulf that has been dug between them and, for the first time in his short life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. He saw the gulfthat had been dug apart from the rest of the society. He felt the pain of being a beggar, and he felt that he was not a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to standsegregated from the others by a chain of their own devising - a poetic thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars were often poets, and poets almost always beggars. Since metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Skkiru had taken theeasy way out. Bbulas had taken the high priestess, Larhgan, out of the temple. He shook hands with the Bartons quickly. That is - you are people, aren\u2019t you? He asked. Why not? said Max with a poise that June admired. Well, you are all so\u2014so-so\u2014 Patrick Mead's eyes roamed across thefaces of the group. So varied. They could find no meaning in that, and stood puzzled. I mean, Patrick Mead said into the silence, all these\u2014interesting different hair colors and face shapes and so forth\u2014 He made a vaguewave with one hand as if he had run out of words or was anxious not toinsult them. Joke? Max asked, bewildered. June laid a hand on his arm. No harm meant, she says to him over the intercom. We're just as much of a shock to him as he is to us. She addressed a question to the tall colonist on outside sound. Whatshould a person look like, Mr. Mead? He indicated her with a smile. Like you. He looked down at her curiously for a moment before answering. Only one hundred and fifty. He smiled. Don't worry, this isn't a cityplanet yet. There is room for a few more people. There's room for more people, he says. He laughs and sobered. But then why wear spacesuits? The air is breathable. He looks comfortable, and they longed to takeoff the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins. They were immune to the wind. They had one here, and Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons and weapons, and the long-winded hair. They came twoyears after the colony, and killed everyone except the descendants of the people who came before them.",

The wreckage and the dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the army. When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists, thirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children, were missing. The buildings had been burned, so were the bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had, nobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier finally stumbled on something. For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the mainbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be buried in the center of each colony, because it was important to blowa whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn vital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bombat Lupus IV too, and though it had not blown. The detonator had been buried in a bomb in the middle of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of earth, the wire had been dug up and cut. The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five hundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small, weak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread the news, and Man began to fall back. In a thickening stream he came back from the hard-won stars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of the colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, diedin fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in thoseships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of asociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only defense Earth had.

It is the thirty pieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations haves left the whole planet to Mars, because they lack the courage and vision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable conflict. Because they are selling us out, they are making Earth, the first home of man, a colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the greatMartian land-owners? Do you? He paused out of breath; then finishedvenomously, Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper than robots\u2014cheap as slaves. What about it? gulped Ryd, pulling away from the fanatic. What you want me to do about it, Mury takes a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was once more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. He had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before they started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from their armor. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor; the weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogater, sittingstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded: What do you think you\u2019re trying to do? What does he think? Mury replies, \u201cI\u2019ll need you, Ryd.\u201d And there are fifty thousand credits in it for you. Are you with us? Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd\u2018s mind. And he knew one thingcertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, bythis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as We never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,desperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war and panclasm\u2014that was We. The question hung in the air for a long moment.

He has an expensive transparent hat slanted over the face, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that are alert and almost frighteningly black. He wears a dark-gray cellotex of a sort rarely seen in places like the bar. He had a blond, youthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with an astrogator's triangled stars which made him ex officio the brainsof the vessel. He hunched his narrow shoulders and spread his hands in a habitual gesture of defeat. He was a foreman ten years ago, but he doesn\u2019t have the physique for Mars. He might just have made it then, but the plant was going to open again, and that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burningactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.

That must have been the Power Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself, which shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down outside the military bases in the Kun Lun. He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his shoulder: You know what that means, Ryd. He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear his head. A warm gulp seems to clearhis head. He feels a queer upsurge of confidence in this strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy. He felt a queer excitement at the prospect of having his first free drink in a month. He wishes himself back in Bursh Isls\u2019 with his first meal in months. The thought of it brought tears to his eyes. He sees the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he is flung spinning, back against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled to keep on his feet, he sees the man in the airlock coming up from acrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing lever. The other laughed shortly. No, I\u2019m just a man about to offer him a chance to offer you a chance at a life again. For a come-back. He\u2019ll need you. As for your friends\u2014 The gunmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. Out of those clamps. You\u2019re going to ride this out in the portside airlock. He tries to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before they start with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from their armor. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor; the weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogater, sittingstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded: What do you think you\u2019ve trying to do? What does he think? Mury is taking the ship into space, on schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell. The flame gun moved with a jerk. And as for Arliess, the imprisoned guardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless in his little cell of steel.",

    "The story takes place in New York City. The protagonist, Don Alford, is an unemployed pharmacist. He is on his way to the Antivisectionist Gazette when he comes across the advertisement for the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth (POSAT) in the July 1953 issue of The Bulletin of Physical Research. He finds the advertisement in the bottom of a column in the magazine. The advertisement is in the form of an advertisement for a booklet of information about the secret source of those profound principles that can solve the problems of life. The organization is described as an ancient secret society that has been around for hundreds of years. It is located in a huge warehouse with a huge sprawling warehouse, a wholesale pharmacy, a printer\u2019s plant, an upholstering shop, and is also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms. It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a doormarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT. The reception room is hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk desk facing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the pattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of the summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloomsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace herethat he had come to expect. The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looks very ordinary. She smiles and says that they have been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step into the next room\u2014 She opens a door opposite the stairwell, and Don steps through it. The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the shock of a dentist's drill. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing. Although it was delivering as much light as a twoor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined itminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries. The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had neverseen a similar tube before, but because aftereffects of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his brain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle thatcouldn\u2019t be scratched until he turned back to the page. He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that some component of the story had been noticed by a part of the brain. The symbol or emblem of the organization had caught his attention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small black circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohratom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the printed matter that accompanied it. Then, because his typewriterwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and insertedit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dottedlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he had, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time. The buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way up through the murky stairwell.",

Ravenhurst is also the first one to admit to the fact that he was responsible for sabotaging the ship, which led to the destruction of the ship. The two have a tense relationship, and it is revealed that Ravenhurst does not want to work with Oak because he does not like his methods of operation. When Oak tries to tell him that he can\u2019t pay him anything near what he is worth, Ravenhurst tells him that it will have to come out of his pocket because he cannot possibly justify it from operating funds. He also tells Oak that he doesn't want him messing around with the espionage and sabotage problem because he is afraid that he will lose his position as manager if he goes against his orders.",
    "The flitterboat is a small vessel that can be used to travel between planets in the Belt. It is used by the Fustians to get to and from their home planet, Raven\u2019s Rest. It has a single gravitoinertial engine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very little food. It can\u2019t be used for any great distances because a man can stay in a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to hop from beacon to beacon, which means that your average velocity doesn\u2018t amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating and decelerating. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have to be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low as ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting right out of the glass [4] again. The momentum it builds up is enough to make it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all over the place. Besides which, even if it doesn't splash, it would take it so long to fall a few inches that you\u2019d die of thirst waiting for it. Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice. The negative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time you see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning andthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force. I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped atit. He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass andsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk againdid he raise his eyes and look at me for the final time since I'd comein. Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble. I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ripley, I said, keeping my voice level. [5] So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to youraction than we had at first supposed. His voice had the texture of heavy linseed oil. He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When I didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. I fear that you haveinadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to preventsabotage, and I\u2019m afraid that you abrogated your contract. I just continued speaking to him.",

    "Garrett is the most famous pirate in the void. He is six feet three, twice as strong as he looks. He wears a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and a set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting on a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his great weight. He smiles at Star, and there is a touch of hell in his smile. He gets the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and goes into a dive that flips him behind a rock. The three actions took only asplit-second, the blast from the jet-guns flaked rock where he had been standing. While a jet-Gun is a most deadly weapon known, you have to press aloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew this very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind thespur of stone to fire his own gun. If his reflexes hadn\u2019t been as quick as they were, he would haveblasted the girl. The girl is very round-eyed and nervous. He had explained to her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or have executed, by anyone. Which was very true. A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Starfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. Ifthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrettwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed Starrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam intime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echoover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and letthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want that. Not that it would matter to Star. Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It was not a Hineson Sub-space beamer... it was an old-style transmitterwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridgerunits in it. The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thusthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's death. And then... whatever Garrett had planned, Star wished heartily that he could have a chance to interfere. The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screenchange, solidify into a figure... the figure of District CommanderWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips move\u2014then Mr. Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun in his hand. Mr. Weddel sees him, sees the gunin his hand, and Mr. Gertrude sees him. He straightened, and saw the leveled gun from the corner of his eye. He got the jet on the right side of Star\u2019s head. He knew that the girl was safe, so he knew that he would not be able to kill her. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going to hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while, I'm going to have you executed... before a stellar vision screen, connected with Section Void Headquarters!

Now the clouds of dust are slowly settling in the gravity. Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear. They sprayed a faint light on our surroundings that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak to be reflected toward Earth. We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beamsof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's surface. The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remainedmotionless and quiet.

Martin was married to Jack Barry, a biology student at Wood's Hole, and she was the love of his life. She had been in love with him for a long time, and they were engaged to be married when she died in a train accident. Martin had been away for a while, and Jack had never met her before. When he came back to the house, he had no idea that she had died, and he didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. He had never seen her before, and the only thing he knew about her was that she was from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred British stock. Mary Alice was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point very wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and dideverything she could to win them over. For instance, she took up horseback riding, because that was Haniand Hilda\u2018s favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her fear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But her brave gesture did not pacify them: it only increased their hatred. Except for his love, Martin was blind to everything but his love. He was building a home for himself and Mary, but year by year, month by month, month month, he would plan, they would visit BuenosAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would teach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where he would occupy a chair at the university for a few months. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014 Jack broke in with, Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive work on growth and fertilization? Mrs. Kesserserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gatheringdarkness. But now he was coming home, his work done.

And although she dreaded it, Maryrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering to the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from thesaddle to welcome him home. Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the stationwagon had to be sent down for that. She looked defiantly at Jack. She paused. She stared at his outstretched right hand, slowly extended her owntoward it, shook it up and down exactly once, then quickly dropped it. He chuckled and gulped some lemonade. He held it up to the failing light and suckedin his breath with surprise. The small sound of the cabinet door closing brings Jack back toreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. The girl looked puzzled, Jack explained, The old boy's been off to Europe on some conferences, won't be back for a couple days more. But I was to get started anyhow. When I went out this morning, Mrs Kessrich\u2014she's a drab sort of person\u2014said to me, \u201cDon't try to sail to the farther islands.\u201d So, of course, I had to. She opened a panel, opened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and handed him a photograph.

Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for hewas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. Infact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been Mary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms. A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Jack turned. The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young, sensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was a click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped grayhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitivemouth grew sardonic.",

    "The reason for different planets introducing rules to the United Universe is because the Wise Ones believe that wars arise from not understanding one\u2019s fellows, not sympathizing with them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the same laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be nodifferences, and hence no wars. Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred yearsthere had been no war in the Earth, and there was peace and plenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solarsystems\u2014injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepathsof Aldebaran were still trying to add thought to the statute). Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any reason for the Lodge's existence, any reason to a group of humans toretire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitiveforefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had, perhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing theworld. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's face upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the past\u2014the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coalfurnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days? The Father Superior had smiled. You are not yet a fully fledgedBrother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved your majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Whydon't you spend some time outside and see how you like it? Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying the ways of the U.S. He had skimmed over Earth, because he had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his pre-preparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence. He could tell from their looks that the others did, but couldn't bring themselves to put it into words. I suppose it's the time-scale and the value-scale that are so hard for us to accept, he said softly. Much more, even, than the size-scale.The thought that there are creatures in the Universe to whom the wholecareer of Man\u2014in fact, the whole career of life\u2014is no more than a fewthousand or hundred thousand years. And to whom Man is only a trifling part of a clever job of camouflage. This time he went on, Fantasy writers have at times hinted all sortsof odd things about the Earth\u2014that it might even be a kind of single living creature, or honeycombed with inhabited caverns, and so on. But I don\u2019t know that any of them have ever suggested that Earth, together with all the planets and moons of the Solar System, might be....

He lives in an underground city called Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47, which is located in the middle of the chalk desert. He is the only human on the planet, and he lives in a metal heart that is covered in a thick layer of red dust. There is a high wall around it, and there is a heavy gate carved with lotus blossoms. There are a lot of people who live in the city, and they are called the Overseers. The Overseers are there to help prepare the planet for colonization, and their job is to take care of the inhabitants of the planet. They do not give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people for the job. They don't provide accommodations for couples when the law specified only one occupant. They aren't providing fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits betweenthe various Overseers, but they are providing fuel for visits. They weren't very providential, but it was two hundred thousand dollars a year in salary, and it offered them wonderful opportunities. It gave Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making a tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as bright as envy. The city was strange, fantastic, beautiful. He had never been there before, yet already he was a fabulous legend\u2014a dire, hateful legend. [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine October 1962. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] He lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and an odd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him the little winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he could only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minaretsthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the Canal. One part of his mind said, This is it, this is the fabled city of Mars, and I must go down there. Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep inthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut andurgent. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the city before your body becomes a husk, a soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those who came before you. He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantasticbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to close them while he pushed himself back but they remained open, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks. The wind freshened and the tune of music began to talk to him. It told of going barefoot over long streets of fur, it told of jewels, and wine, and women as fair as springtime. He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his headbegan to turn. He turned, and the spire and minarets twinkling at him,beautiful, soothing, stopping his tears. When he reached the bottom, he began to run toward the city. He beat against the gate and cried,Oh! He had to get away, he had to mount the walls and never look back. He told himself, I am Eric North, from Earth, the third Planet of Sol, and this is not real. He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until he could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of thecanal. He ran at the walls. He wouldn't look again. He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether it was really better than war. He was able to get as fat and as dirty as he liked, he would be more like an animal and think more like a god than any man for generations.

They had ships, and could build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets. They could take little of their science, and fear and riots destroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for this homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable again. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the building of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect asmall colony of those who are chosen to remain on Mars. The machine is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is necessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting device capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any sort of material desired, and a construction device to assemble this material into the pattern already recorded from thought. The idea is that the machine is meant to be used to control the minds of the people. However, when he tries to use the machine, his mental pattern changes, and it is no longer able to control his mind.

At ten o'clock they cross the road to Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls order sandwiches and coffee and Hank goes right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but hemerely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana. At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but hesaid, I haven't danced with my girl Rhona. His tongue was thick, his mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her face\u2014pretty Rhona, who'd made a ritual of flirting with him, who now looked as if she were going to be sick. So let's rock, he said and stood up. They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted. He waitedfor her to come close on her own, and she did, but she didn't.

They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, andPhil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen andlooked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fenceparalleling the road.

The wreckage and the dead are found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the army. When the army comes it finds this: Of the seventy registered colonists, thirty-one are dead. The rest, including some women and children, are missing. The buildings had been burned, so were the bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had, nobody knows. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier finally stumbled on something. For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the mainbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be buried in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow a whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn vital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bombat Lupus IV too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. Thedetonating wire had been cut. In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of earth, the wire had being dug up and cut. The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After fivehundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small, weak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread the news, and Man began to fall back. In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won stars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of the colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died in fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in thoseships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of asociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only defense Earth had.

    "The Grannies are a group of people who live on Jupiter\u2019s moon of Jupiter. They are the descendants of the first Lunarexployers, who came to the moon to find Acoustix, which is a mineral that can be used as a source of sound. The people of the planet are called \u201cGrannies\u201d, and they live in the Baldric, an area of the moon that is filled with a variety of life forms, including flagpole trees and a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. There are also two companies, Interstellar Voice and Larynx Incorporated, that run on the moon. The two companies are run by Jimmy Baker, an old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of Varsoom country, and he tells the story of the Green Flame. The Green Flame is a radio-activerock once found on Mercury. The Alpha rays of this rock are similarto radium in that they consist of streams of material particles projected at high speed. But the character of the Gamma rays hasnever been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are electromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of Beta or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons. When any form of life is exposed to these Gamma rays from the GreenFlame rock, they produce in the brain a certain lassitude and lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition develops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or guidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of tolerance. The green flame is also said to be an inorganic opiate, a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug. Grannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when shelaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only atransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from visiting her stage in person. Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of Interstellar Voice on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had anothernovel in the state of embryo.

Glad to meet you, he said cordially. I\u2019ve just been trying topersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into The Baldric. What sort of trouble? I had asked. And when AntlersPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, Fiddlesticks, I neversaw trouble yet that couldn\u2018t be explained. We leave in an hour. I mean, the Dome has an air-conditioning system. The ungodly moans of your\u2014er\u2014so-called musical instrument can be heard through the entirestructure. He suddenly seemed to gain stature. No, Jones, this order is final! You cannot disrupt our entireorganization for your own\u2014er-amusement. But\u2014 said Isobar. No! Iso bar wriggled desperately.

Will you believe me, sir, he said, when I tell you I've been outhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself? I scowled at that; it didn't make sense. However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activitieshere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix. It's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'mnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on Mars has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches middle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases. Then it was found that this ore revitalized their soundingapparatus, and the rush was on. What do you mean? Park leaned back. The rush to find more of the ore, he explained. There is a lot of trouble brewing a cell-block away, he would never have survived to reach his captaincy. And her name, he saw, was Sue-Ann Bradley, Detainee No. WFA-656R.

He demanded: Why wouldn't you mop out your cell? The girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward.

There is no hurry to be going home, although he is alone, although this is Alpha Centauri II with many unknowns, many dangers, and home is a very great distance away. There was no one back there to worry about him, no children, no friends, no family. He decides to explore the city to see if there is anything he can learn about the natives. He finds books in the old city, but they are not very interesting to him. He sees a statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest detail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found booksstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them withouttools. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog, under a roof that had weathered half a hundred thousand years of rain and sun. Then he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.

The city was not sacred to the gods, but to the natives, and it was a place of great importance to them. The natives were intelligent, intelligent, and intelligent. They were highly intelligent, though uneducated. He decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down theancient street, a mere speck against the sand. He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings before him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were hugewith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Squarebuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges connected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebonysurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets and filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smallerbuildings. Ignoring the native, Michaelson poked about among the ruinshappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact, marveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to catch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled over the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulationof ages. He discovered a small device that measured the time of the day.",

He thinks that the book is like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it talks. When he uses the cylinder, it leads to a path of some kind, leading to a place where Maota is now. It was a door of some sort, where he used the cylinder to travel to that place. To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result as before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence. He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon. It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it lookedlike a glorified African blowgun.

I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.Why not have a try at negotiating our differences? He looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's face. Finally he shook his head sadly. When we first met I hoped wecould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We have finished, you and I. He turns and starts off, shoulders slumped dejectedly. He looks off toward the hills, eyes distant. Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the city? There are many directions. Don\u2019t understand, you would not understand. No, no, there is another direction to see. Come, if you must see. They came to a section of the city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed against larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand. There was a path that led to a particular building. There is a room with hand-made chairs and a bed. Above the bed a clock was fastened to the wall. He looked down into the black, charred hole. He walked all around the hole, thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.",
    "The webfoot is a native of Alpha Centaurus II, a colony from the fifth planet of the solar system. He is an old man who lives in the city of A City Near Centaurus. He has long gray hair and a thin, weathered face. He wears no shoes, and his webbed feet drag in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. The webfoot has a small cylinder buried in flesh behind his ear, which he holds in his hand. He looks like a timepiece of somesort, and it measures a time-piece of sorts. It looks like an alloy that is impervious to rust and wear, but it has some other function. Michaelson looks off down the street, trying to ignore thenative, and tries to feel the life of the city as it might have been. The city lies now in darkness, waiting for morning so it can lie dead and still in the sun. There is no hurry to be going home, although he is alone, although this is Alpha Centauri II with many unknowns, many dangers. There was no one back there to worry about him. His wife had died many years ago back on Earth. His friends in the settlement would not look for him for another day atleast. He walks away from the old man, heading for another building. Thesun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. Heglanced backward. He sees the webfoot was following him, and Mr. Earthgod, it is sacred ground where he is trespassing. He does not leave, as I asked you. He says, You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy the home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of change and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now, or be killed. He makes a clucking sound deep in the throat. The spirits are angry. The natives are angry, and wind has blown sand against them for eons, and rain and sleet, but their story is there, once we decipher it. The native\u2019s lined and weathered old face is working around the mouth in anger, and he is almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly serious. He points out that the wall is made of some metal, I\u2019d say, some alloy, that is resistant to rust, and wear. The spirit is angry, but the spirits are never coming back here. No spirits are ever coming back, don\u2019t you know that? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half covered with sand and dirt. He goes away, and the native follows him.",

The cylinder is a time-piece of sorts that records the history of the inhabitants of the planet. It is a very important part of the story because it is the reason why Michaelson is able to find the city. The city is very old, but it is not as old as it seems. It has been there for half a million years, and there is no way of knowing how long it has been in existence.",

His office is located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floor of the Cullen Building. The building is a hundred stories high, and there is only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant building. Walton has removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping thattrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed the massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But themark of the last century is stamped irrevocably on both building and office. He peered covertly over his shoulder; no one was in sight. He slips the baby's card into his breast pocket. He punches out a request for the card on Philip Prior. A moment's pause followed, while the millions of tiny cryotroniccircuits raced with information pulses, searching the Donnersontubes for Philip Prior's record. Then, a brief squeaking sound and a yellow-brown card dropped out of the slot: 3216847AB1 PRIOR, Philip Hugh. He scrapped the guide sheet he had and typed out a message to themachine. Please alter in all circuits. He proceeded to retype the child's card, omitting both the fatal symbol 3f2 and the notation recommending euthanasia from the new version. The machine beeped an acknowledgement. Walton smiled. The technician practically backed out of his presence. No doubt I must radiate charisma, he thought. He slipped the baby\u2019s card in his pocket. The color change was almost imperceptible, but it was enough to indicate that he wasn\u2019t interested.",

He wears a bright red robe, and he is almost completely naked. His skin is clean-smelling, and his skin is fine-muscled, fine-boned, and fine-bone. He is almost entirely naked. He has a brilliant red-sleeved sash around his middle, which is matched by a red topdress that came down over his shoulders as acircular mantle.

Two other persons appeared from somewhere back of her. They walk back to the deaconette's booth and Matheny cashed whatremains of his winnings. They walked back to Captain Small's booth, and Captain Small gives him a drink of the best damn water in the solar system. The water twinkles in the two glasses, winking as if it knew just what it had done. Captain Small tells him that it is the only thing that kept Karyl alive long enough to warn them about the aliens. He looks around for some place to hide his burning ears. He tries to hide them, but Captain Small offers him a place to sit down. They go to a bar downshaft. There is no sign of habitation, but there is a hollow shell filled with water to be shot out of a rocket tube converted into a projectile thrower. These Steel-Blues, as you call them, puttraction beams on us and started tugging Ustoward the asteroid. We tried a couple of atomic shots but when they just glanced off, we gave up. They weren't expecting the shell of water. They let go the traction beams and tried to get away. They forgot about the force field, so we just poured atomic fire into the weakening ship. It just meltedaway. Jon Karyl gets up from the divan where he'd been lying. They thought I was ametal creature, too. But where do you supposethey came from? The captain shrugged. Who knows? Jon set two glasses on the table. He asks Captain Small for a drink, and the captain agrees.",

Overhead and to each side, largedrops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scoutship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground. Damn this climate. Doesn't it ever do anything here except rain. Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. His attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And why was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he beendoing during that time? Listlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture from his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone outwhen the scout ship cracked up. He remembered now that he had gone over the job very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle alone\u2014or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little orno chance of his being able to find either here. Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and brought them out where he could look at them: The mother ship, Soscite II, had been on the last leg of itsplanet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scoutship\u2014the other seven had all been lost one way or another during theexploring of new worlds\u2014and set itself into a giant orbit about thisplanet that Kaiser had named Big Muddle. The Soscines II had to maintain its constant speed; it had no meansof slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop. Its limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an orbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circlea pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low.

There was something of that hope in his voice as he spoke to her. He thought of the springs that flow on the floor of the valley and the glitter of the water in the feathery green of the year.

They are living in a small city on Earth, and they are trying to figure out what is going to happen to their planet. They have no idea what to do about it, and the only way they know how to solve the problem is to go to the moon of Phobos and Deimos to see if they can\u2019t find a way to destroy it. There is no way to do that, so they have no choice but to go into space to see what they can do to stop it. However, they are unable to do it because the moon is too far away from the sun. The only way to stop the destruction of the planet is to take a rocket ship to Mars, and that is what they are doing.

She and her god friends like to keep some of their thoughts secret, but the other gods have forbidden them to. They are afraid of the thoughts they may think in secret. They follow us to hunt us down. There are many more of them than of us. The other gods are angry and scared, so they are afraid to let them know what they are thinking. There is also the Disordered Space Hypothesis, even if it is little more than the chancephrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist. The Kometevskis are very suspicious of the idea that the Earth is going to explode, or drop through unseen holes in space.

The Wolvers are a group of people who work on the discovery of new planets. They are the descendants of the first humans to explore the solar system, and they are the first to discover that the Earth is not the only planet in the Solar System, but rather the first of many. The story begins with Theodor, Celeste, and Theodor\u2019s other wives, Edmund and Frieda, discussing the disappearance of Phobos and Deimos, and the possibility that the two moons have disappeared. The two moons are moving in the same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanished moons, and occupy roughly the same volumes of space, though the mass of material is hardly a hundredth that of the moons. Physicists have no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation of the Disintegration Hypothesis. However, there is a markedlessening of tension. The finding of the debris\u2014solid, tangiblestuff\u2014seems to lift the whole affair out of the supernatural miasma in which some of us have been tempted to plunge it. So he ends up by taking a different tack: Besides, if Phobos\u2019 and De\u2019imos simply shot off somewhere, surely they\u2019d have been picked up by now by \u201cscope or radar.\u201d Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter, they are smaller than many of the asteroids, but they are still much larger than the ones we see in the story. Celeste is a woman, and she wants complete security. Theodor is the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this might happen. She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so frank and anxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it muchworse. Of course, there are several more convincing alternate explanations, including that the planets and their moons trade positionsevery so often. As if they were playing Going to Jerusalem, or musical chairs. As Celeste chimed in, but she couldn\u2019t make it sound funny. Jupiter was supposed to have started as the outermost planet, and is to end up in the orbit of Mercury. Well, nothingat all like that has happened, but it has begun. But it is begun, and you cannot argue away that stubborn little fact. You can't argue away the fact that there are two moons that have appeared and disappeared. That was the trouble; you couldn't. Mars\u2019 two tiny moons had simply vanished during a period when, as was generally the case, the eyes of astronomy weren't on them. Just some hundred-odd cubic miles of rock\u2014the merest cosmic flyspecks\u2014yet they had carried away with them the security of a whole world. Looking at the shrubby hills would begin to roll like waves, thecharmingly aimless paths twist like snakes and sink in the green sea, the sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds theypierced. People must have felt like this, she thought, when Aristarches firsthinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feetwas falling dizzily through space. Only it is worse for us, because they cannot see that anything had changed. We can, but we can. We need something to cling to, and we need to find it in Theodor.

    "Kay Smith is a girl from the planet Fieu Dayol. She is described as tall and lissome, with hyacinth hair and liquid blue eyes, and she has a Grecian symmetry of shape that would have made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading table, where he was keeping company with his favorite little magazine, The Zeitgeist, Quidley watched her take a seemingly haphazard routeto the shelf where Taine's History reposed, take the volume down, surreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages and return it to the shelf. After she left he wasted no time in acquainting himself with the second message. It was as unintelligible as the first: asdf ;lkj asdf, T'lide sid Fieu dayol po jestigtoseo knwo, bijk weil en snoll doper entling\u2014Yoolna. As the story goes on, she returns the book to the librarian\u2019s desk and takes it over to the Librarian's desk. When she returns, she takes the book back to the library and returns it to her purse. This time, when she walks out the door, he is not far behind her. She climbs into a sleek convertible and pulls into the street. Ittook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her. When, several blocks later, she pulls to the curb in front of an all-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely amatter of following her inside. He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good steadbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple. First you take note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you situated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and thenearest one, order coffee without sugar in a low voice, and after the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till he/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar. Then you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such away that some of its contents spilled on her lap. She shook her head vehemently. When you compromised me, you made yourself liable in the eyes of both. But why pick on me. Whydon't you marry one of them? For two reasons: one, you're the particular man who compromisedme. Two, there are not plenty of men on the planet. Our race is identical to yours in everything except population-balance between thesexes. At periodic intervals the women greatlyoutnumber the men that those of us who are temperamentally and emotionally unfitted to become spinsters have to look for wotnids -ormates - on other worlds. It's quite legal and quite respectable. As a matter of fact, we even have schools specializing in alien culturesto expedite our activities. Our biggest problem is the Interstellarstatute forbidding us the use of local communications services and forbidding us to appear in public places. This was devised to facilitate the prosecution of interstellar black marketeers, but we're subject to it, too, and have to contrive communications systems of our own.",
    "Herbert Quidley is the protagonist of the story. He is a young man who lives in the city of Fieu Dayol. He works as a typist. He lives in a small apartment with his wife and two children. He has a love of books, and he is very interested in the history of English literature. When he first meets Kay Smith, he notices that she is very attractive. She is tall, with hyacinth hair and liquid blue eyes, and she has a Grecian symmetry of shape that would have made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's desk and headed for the literature section. When she comes to the O's she pauses, takes down a book and glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the P's... the Q's...the R's. Barely three feet from him she pauses again and took down Taine's History of English Literature. The odds against two persons taking an interest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library were ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the volume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it with the air of a seasoned browser. Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected another\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the libr's desk. She waited statuesquely while the lifter processed it, then tucked it under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.

It belongs to them now... all of it. But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!I'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that peoplelaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my nickname. Have you heard it? It's Captain Major Midas. I had millions in my hands.
