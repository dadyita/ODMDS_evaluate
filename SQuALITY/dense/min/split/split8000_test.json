Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n"

I waited for the electronic brain to\ninterfere and, with a cold knot in my stomach, realized the machine had\nsaid it had no way to control our actions!\n  \n \n  \"Your purpose won't be fulfilled, will it?\" Kane demanded. \"Not if you\nreturn with dead specimens!\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" the machine admitted.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't take us back to the Moon,\" Kane threatened, \"I'll kill\n   \n   all of us\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  The alien electronic brain was silent.\n  \n \n  By this time, I couldn't see and Kane's voice was a hollow, faraway\nthing that rang in my ears. I tugged at my bindings, but they only\ntightened as I struggled.\n  \n \n  \"If you take us back to the Moon, your masters will never know you\nfailed in your mission. They won't know you failed because you won't\nbring them proof of your failure.\"\n  \n \n  My fading consciousness tried to envision the alien mechanical brain as\nit struggled with the problem.\n  \n \n  \"Look at it this way,\" Kane persisted. \"If you carry our corpses to\nyour masters, all your efforts will have been useless. If you return us\nto the Moon alive, you'll still have a chance to carry out your mission\nlater.\"\n  \n \n  A long silence followed. Verana and Marie screamed at Kane to let go.\nA soft darkness seemed to fill the room, blurring everything, drowning\neven their shrieks in strangling blackness.\n  \n \n  \"You win,\" the machine conceded. \"I'll return the ship to the Moon.\"\n  \n \n  Kane released his grip on my throat.\n  \n \n  \"See?\" he asked. \"Didn't I tell you every problem has a solution?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. I was too busy enjoying breathing again.\n  \n<doc-sep>Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready\nfor an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the\ndarkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over\nthat curving surface for identifying features.\n  \n \n  While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly\nseized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage\nkick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an\nunexpected voice.\n  \n \n  \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" it whispered angrily. \"Who do you think\nyou are?\"\n  \n \n  Startled, he dropped his hammer. \"I'm Roddie,\" he said, squatting to\nfumble for it. \"Who do you think\n   \n   you\n   \n  are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls\n   \n   are\n   \n  there in this raiding\nparty?\"\n  \n \n  His first Invader\u2014and he had dropped his weapon!\n  \n \n  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused\nsuddenly. This girl\u2014whatever\n   \n   that\n   \n  was\u2014seemed to think him one of\nher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn\ndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he\nkilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!\n  \n \n  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would\n   \n   I\n   \n  know how many girls there\nare?\"\n  \n \n  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.\nRoddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"\n  \n \n  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight\nwith fear of discovery.\n  \n \n  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper\nwas friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.\nThey shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't\nit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't\nhave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and\nrising. \"How did you get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the\ndust and they led me here. Where were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man\nwhen I came back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these\nandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"\n  \n \n  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find\nhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the\nmanhole would help him now to redeem himself....\n  \n"

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname. Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n"

A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him.

He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship.

And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment.

It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come\u2014for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n<doc-sep>Willard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND\u2014ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n  \n"

But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  GALACTIC GHOST\n  \n \n  By WALTER KUBILIUS\n  \n \n  The Flying Dutchman of space was a harbinger\n   \n  of death. But Willard wasn't superstitions.\n   \n  He had seen the phantom\u2014and lived.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come\u2014for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n<doc-sep>Willard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND\u2014ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n  \n"

A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n  \n \n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n  \n \n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>A stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\n  \n \n  Retief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\n  \n \n  The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\n   \n   Lament of\nHatching\n   \n  ,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n  \n \n  \"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n  \n \n  \"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\n  \n \n  The minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n  \n"

Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war.

Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n  \n"

        "In the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low\ncloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. The\nthree mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight of\nhis immense shell on the heavy plank flooring.\n  \n \n  \"Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth we\nbludgeoned aboard the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  ,\" he sighed. \"Soon will I be forced\ninto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as I\nwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-daily\nfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is no\npleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismal\noutlook for one's next thousand years!\"\n  \n \n  \"You two carry on to the police station,\" said Retief. \"I want to play\na hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.\"\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014?\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"As you wish, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped\ndown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood\nvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.\n  \n \n  \"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police\nprotection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a\nposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring\nblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed\nwrong....\n  \n \n  There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.\n  \n \n  Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had\nreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A\nsmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed\noff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side\nof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing\nGroaci.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat\nbladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of\ndismembering me out of hand!\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.\"\n  \n \n  \"I appeal to you,\" Yith whispered hoarsely. \"As a fellow diplomat, a\nfellow alien, a fellow soft-back\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk?\" said Retief. \"Now\nkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.\"\n  \n \n  The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the\nground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was\non its back, helpless.\n  \n \n  \"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's\ncaught\u2014and why.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk came toward the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  dragging the supine Fustian, who\nkicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the\nsentry box. \"Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can\noutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.\" He stepped out and\nhailed Whonk.\n  \n \n  Puffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. \"Sleep,\nRetief!\" He panted. \"You followed a hunch; I did the same. I saw\nsomething strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. I\nwatched, followed him here. Look! It is Slock, strapped into a dead\ncarapace! Now many things become clear.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief whistled. \"So the Youths aren't all as young as they look.\nSomebody's been holding out on the rest of you Fustians!\"\n  \n \n  \"The Soft One,\" Whonk said. \"You laid him by the heels, Retief. I saw.\nProduce him now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on a minute, Whonk. It won't do you any good\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Whonk winked broadly. \"I must take my revenge!\" he roared. \"I shall\ntest the texture of the Soft One! His pulped remains will be scoured up\nby the ramp-washers and mailed home in bottles!\"\n  \n \n  Retief whirled at a sound, caught up with the scuttling Yith fifty feet\naway, hauled him back to Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"It's up to you, Whonk,\" he said. \"I know how important ceremonial\nrevenge is to you Fustians. I will not interfere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mercy!\" Yith hissed, eye-stalks whipping in distress. \"I claim\ndiplomatic immunity!\"\n  \n \n  \"No diplomat am I,\" rumbled Whonk. \"Let me see; suppose I start with\none of those obscenely active eyes\u2014\" He reached....\n  \n \n  \"I have an idea,\" said Retief brightly. \"Do you suppose\u2014just this\nonce\u2014you could forego the ceremonial revenge if Yith promised to\narrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace you elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" Whonk protested, \"those eyes! What a pleasure to pluck them, one\nby one!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yess,\" hissed Yith, \"I swear it! Our most expert surgeons ... platoons\nof them, with the finest of equipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have dreamed of how it would be to sit on this one, to feel him\nsquash beneath my bulk....\"\n  \n \n  \"Light as a whissle feather shall you dance,\" Yith whispered.\n\"Shell-less shall you spring in the joy of renewed youth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe just one eye,\" said Whonk grudgingly. \"That would leave him\nfour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Be a sport,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Well.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a deal then,\" said Retief. \"Yith, on your word as a diplomat,\nan alien, a soft-back and a skunk, you'll set up the mission. Groaci\nsurgical skill is an export that will net you more than armaments.\nIt will be a whissle feather in your cap\u2014if you bring it off. And\nin return, Whonk won't sit on you. And I won't prefer charges of\ninterference in the internal affairs of a free world.\"\n  \n \n  Behind Whonk there was a movement. Slock, wriggling free of the\nborrowed carapace, struggled to his feet ... in time for Whonk to seize\nhim, lift him high and head for the entry to the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Hey,\" Retief called. \"Where are you going?\"\n  \n \n  \"I would not deny this one his reward,\" called Whonk. \"He hoped to\ncruise in luxury. So be it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"That tub is loaded with titanite!\"\n  \n \n  \"Stand not in my way, Retief. For this one in truth owes me a\nvengeance.\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as the immense Fustian bore his giant burden up the ramp\nand disappeared within the ship.\n  \n \n  \"I guess Whonk means business,\" he said to Yith, who hung in his grasp,\nall five eyes goggling. \"And he's a little too big for me to stop.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk reappeared, alone, climbed down.\n  \n \n  \"What did you do with him?\" said Retief. \"Tell him you were going to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We had best withdraw,\" said Whonk. \"The killing radius of the drive is\nfifty yards.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The controls are set for Groaci. Long-may-he-sleep.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n  \n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n  \n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire\u2014\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\n  \n"

Ocean, and there was no ocean in Iowa.\n  \n \n  And this wasn't Iowa.\n  \n \n \n   The explosions had ripped the world, and he'd tried to get to town to\nsave Davie, and there'd been no town and there'd been no people and\nthere'd been only death and poison in the air and even those few people\nleft had begun to die, and then the truck with the huge trailer had\ncome, the gleaming trailer with the little man and his trembling wife\nand his two sons....\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Michaelson tested one of the chairs to see if it would hold his weight,\nthen sat down. His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  complex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n  \n \n  \"And what?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\n  \n \n  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\n  \n \n  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\n  \n \n  The old man was dead.\n  \n"

One that attacked only people within the\npolitical borders of the United States!\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Illustrated by Schoenherr\n  \n \n \n  Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignored the jangling telephones and the\nexcited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line\u2014in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause\u2014by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word.\n  \n \n  \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.\n\"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n  \n<doc-sep>  SURVIVAL\n   \n  TACTICS\n  \n \n  By AL SEVCIK\n  \n \n  ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK\n  \n \n \n   The robots were built to serve\nMan; to do his work, see to his\ncomforts, make smooth his way.\nThen the robots figured out an\nadditional service\u2014putting Man\nout of his misery.\n   \n \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n  \n<doc-sep>And from the door, an icy voice said, \"Yes, colonel?\"\n  \n \n  The colonel and his captains wheeled, stared and saluted. \"Oh,\ngeneral,\" the colonel said. \"I was just\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" the brigadier said, stepping into the room. \"I've been\nlistening to you. And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the\nsergeant and his staff alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general, I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his\nchair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face.\n\"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\"\n  \n \n  Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many\nthings. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\"\n  \n \n  The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled\nup a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face\nas he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had\nfeared.\"\n  \n \n  Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A\ncaptain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him.\n  \n \n  \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had\na report\u2014nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the\ncivilian newspapermen\u2014not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a\nday and half. Everybody's frantic. The last item we had\u2014it was a\ncoded message the Reds'd tried to censor\u2014was an indication of\nsomething big in the works.\"\n  \n \n  \"A day and half ago,\" Andy mused. \"Just about the time we knew we had\nan epidemic. And about the time they knew it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that\nthey could cripple us from within.\"\n  \n \n  The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out\neffort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every\nserviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've\nstill got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're\nright ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\"\n  \n \n  Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through\nmuffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there,\nfutility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm.\nHe heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement\nthat silenced him.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll\nfind your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\"\n  \n \n  The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then\nlaunched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and\nyour captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there. For the\nduration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the\nsergeant and the corporal here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general,\" the colonel wailed, \"a noncom? I'm assigned\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The general snorted. \"Insubordination cannot be tolerated\u2014unless you\nfind a two-star general to outrank me. Now, as I said before, let's\nget out of here and let these people work.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The general wheeled to fire a salvo of commands. Officers poured into\nthe corridor. Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling\nhis granite brow.\n  \n \n  \"But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick.\"\n  \n \n  Andy chucked. \"That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk\nlick a stamp? They always use a sponge.\"\n  \n \n  The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and\nthe grin became a rumbling laugh. \"How would you two like a thirty-day\nfurlough to rest up\u2014or to get better acquainted?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand.\n  \n \n  \"And while you're gone,\" the general continued, \"I'll see what strings\nI can pull. If I can't wangle you a couple of battlefield commissions,\nI'll zip you both through O.C.S. so fast you won't even have time to\npin on the bars.\"\n  \n \n  But neither Andy nor Bettijean had heard a word after the mention of\nfurlough. Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the\ndepths of each other's eyes.\n  \n \n  And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent\nstamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the\nstamp out of the office under guard.\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n"

        "In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and\u2014. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers\u2014Aspen, Taos and college towns\u2014thousands of\npeople sick\u2014but none in that valley in Tennessee\u2014and few government\nworkers\u2014just one girl in his office\u2014and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter\u2014and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command.

We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n  \n<doc-sep>It took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City. The Varsoom\nfollowed us far beyond the frontier of their country like an unseen\narmy in the throes of laughing gas. Not until we reached Level Five did\nthe last chuckle fade into the distance.\n  \n \n  All during that trek back, Grannie sat in the dugout, staring silently\nout before her.\n  \n \n  But when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all\nsides. One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR\nUNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN\nAUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE.\n  \n \n  \"Grannie,\" I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE\nJET, \"what are you going to do now? Give up writing science fiction?\"\n  \n \n  She looked at me soberly, then broke into a smile.\n  \n \n  \"Just because some silly form of life that can't even be seen doesn't\nappreciate it? I should say not. Right now I've got an idea for a swell\nyarn about Mars. Want to come along while I dig up some background\nmaterial?\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Not me,\" I said.\n  \n \n  But I knew I would.\n  \n \n"

Lewis\n  \n \n  Illustrated by KELLY FREAS\n  \n<doc-sep>II\n  \n \n  The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home\u2014a weathered white cube with\nnarrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola\u2014was nothing like its\nlavish interior.\n  \n \n  In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming\nfurniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless\nblack form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack\nthink of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered\nagain how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.\n  \n \n  Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the\nuneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were\nstill those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been\nwatching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.\n  \n \n \n \n  He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named\nMary Alice Pope?\"\n  \n \n  The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some\nbovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall\ncabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,\nopened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and\nhanded him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked\nin his breath with surprise.\n  \n \n  It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same\nflat-bosomed dress\u2014flowered rather than white\u2014no bandeau, same beads.\nSame proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.\n  \n \n  \"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat\nvoice. \"She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident\nin 1933.\"\n  \n \n  The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to\nreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the\ngloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with\nwhat seemed a malicious eagerness.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question\u2014he\nwas much too dazed for that\u2014he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her\nposition on the edge of the sofa.\n  \n \n  \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love\nof Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as\nyou probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he\nfirst came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,\nthere was a cloak of loneliness about him\u2014or rather about the three of\nthem.\n  \n \n  \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud\u2014I\ndon't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a\nservant\u2014and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They\nshowered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't\nrealize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with\nMary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without\nmarrying, he was safe.\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred\nBritish stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point\nvery wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did\neverything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was\nafraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani\nand Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But\u2014and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short\u2014her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n  \n \n  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

He was sure Dorr would return\nfor the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg\napproximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the\negg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.\n  \n \n  Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.\n  \n \n  \"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you\ncoming?\"\n  \n \n  There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.\n  \n \n  If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him\nall along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an\negg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he\nwould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from\nwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.\nThere were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his\nway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they\nlost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\n  \n \n  What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at\nnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\n  \n \n  A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\n  \n \n  Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n  \n \n  No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\n  \n \n  \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\nsoon.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n  \n \n  \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n  \n \n  Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n  \n \n  \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\n  \n \n  Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n  \n \n  \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\nthem may not have got back yet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters.

        "Sometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway\u2014for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped\u2014and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014er\u2014you see, Joggy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\n  \n \n  Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\n  \n \n  Michaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n  \n \n  \"For what?\"\n  \n \n  \"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n  \n \n  \"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\n  \n \n  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\n  \n \n  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n  \n \n  \"What about the book?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of book is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\n   \n   kind\n   \n  of book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\n  \n \n  The old man raised the gun.\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  There was a knock.\n  \n \n  Betty bounced up with Olympic\nagility and had the door swinging\nwide before the knocking was quite\ncompleted.\n  \n \n  He was old, little and had bug\neyes behind pince-nez glasses. His\nsuit was cut in the style of yesteryear\nbut when a suit costs two or\nthree hundred dollars you still retain\ncaste whatever the styling.\n  \n \n  Simon said unenthusiastically,\n\"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated\nthe client's chair. \"Sit down,\nsir.\"\n  \n \n  The client fussed himself with\nBetty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed\nSimon, said finally, \"You know\nmy name, that's pretty good. Never\nsaw you before in my life. Stop fussing\nwith me, young lady. Your ad\nin the phone book says you'll investigate\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only\none exception.\"\n  \n \n  \"Excellent. Do you believe in time\ntravel?\"\n  \n \n  Simon said nothing. Across the\nroom, where she had resumed her\nseat, Betty cleared her throat. When\nSimon continued to say nothing she\nventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, why?\"\n  \n \n  Betty looked to her boss for assistance.\nNone was forthcoming. There\nought to be some very quick, positive,\ndefinite answer. She said, \"Well,\nfor one thing, paradox. Suppose you\nhad a time machine and traveled back\na hundred years or so and killed your\nown great-grandfather. Then how\ncould you ever be born?\"\n  \n \n  \"Confound it if I know,\" the little\nfellow growled. \"How?\"\n  \n \n  Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,\nwhat you wanted to see me about.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want to hire you to hunt me up\nsome time travelers,\" the old boy\nsaid.\n  \n \n  Betty was too far in now to maintain\nher proper role of silent secretary.\n\"Time travelers,\" she said, not\nvery intelligently.\n  \n \n  The potential client sat more erect,\nobviously with intent to hold the\nfloor for a time. He removed the\npince-nez glasses and pointed them\nat Betty. He said, \"Have you read\nmuch science fiction, Miss?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n  \n \n  \"Then you'll realize that there are\na dozen explanations of the paradoxes\nof time travel. Every writer in\nthe field worth his salt has explained\nthem away. But to get on. It's my\ncontention that within a century or\nso man will have solved the problems\nof immortality and eternal youth, and\nit's also my suspicion that he will\neventually be able to travel in time.\nSo convinced am I of these possibilities\nthat I am willing to gamble a\nportion of my fortune to investigate\nthe presence in our era of such time\ntravelers.\"\n  \n \n  Simon seemed incapable of carrying\nthe ball this morning, so Betty\nsaid, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the\nfuture has developed time travel why\ndon't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n  \n \n  Simon put in a word. \"The usual\nexplanation, Betty, is that they can't\nafford to allow the space-time continuum\ntrack to be altered. If, say, a\ntime traveler returned to a period of\ntwenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,\nthen all subsequent history would be\nchanged. In that case, the time traveler\nhimself might never be born. They\nhave to tread mighty carefully.\"\n  \n \n  Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't\nexpect you to be so well informed\non the subject, young man.\"\n  \n \n  Simon shrugged and fumbled\nagain with the aspirin bottle.\n "

The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\n  \n \n  Now he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n  \n \n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n  \n \n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n  \n \n  Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n  \n \n  \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n  \n \n  \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\n  \n \n  The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n  \n \n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\n  \n \n  The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n"

        "Mury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\n  \n \n  Almost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n  \n \n  \"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\n  \n \n  He saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\n  \n \n  The inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\n  \n \n  Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n  \n \n  \"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\n   \n   ex officio\n   \n  the brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\n  \n \n  He had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yet Arliess.\"\n  \n \n  \"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  drove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\n  \n \n  Ryd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\n  \n \n  A single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\n  \n \n  Mury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\n  \n \n  Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\n  \n \n  Mury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\n  \n \n  Mury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n  \n \n  \"What's that, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know that well enough. What ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\nthat's the liner\n   \n   Alborak\n   \n  , out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\nfor Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Mury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice\nwas raw and unsteady.\n  \n \n  \"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for\nus\u2014will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty.

        "  Saboteur of Space\n  \n \n  By ROBERT ABERNATHY\n  \n \n  Fresh power was coming to Earth, energy\n   \n  which would bring life to a dying planet.\n   \n  Only two men stood in its way, one a cowardly\n   \n  rat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns\n   \n  in a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen\n   \n  of fate\u2014and even the winner would lose.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Ryd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and\nwatched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\n  \n \n  Now he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n  \n \n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n  \n \n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n  \n \n  Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n  \n \n  \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n  \n \n  \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\n  \n \n  The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n  \n \n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\n  \n \n  The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\n  \n \n  They emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\nrunways\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\nglory\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\nof odd ships\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\nberthed\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\n  \n \n  As the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\nmean safety for them.\n  \n \n  And indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\n  \n \n  Not far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\u2014watched boredly\nenough.\n  \n \n  And out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\nmagnets\u2014the\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  , panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\n  \n \n  \"Relax,\" said Mury in a low voice. \"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\naboard the\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  when she lifts.\" For a moment his black eyes\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\n  \n \n  \"Robots!\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\n\"Martian soldier robots!\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\nGod's sake, take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd licked dry lips. \"Are we going\u2014out into space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Where else?\" said Mury.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

You know more about it than I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n  \n \n  \"And what?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\n  \n \n  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\n  \n \n  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\n  \n \n  The old man was dead.\n  \n"

Is everything set? Check the instruments again, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  \"S-s-sh!\" The low hush of Split Campbell's voice would somehow\npenetrate my dream.\n  \n \n  The voices about me were soft. My dreams echoed the soft female voices\nof this new, strange language.\n  \n \n  \"Campbell, are you there?... Have you forgotten the Code, Campbell?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quiet, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that's swabbing my face? I can't see.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's Vauna. She's smiling at you, Captain. Can't you see her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is this the pretty one we saw through the telescope?\"\n  \n \n  \"One of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what of the other? There were two together. I remember\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Omosla is here too. She's Vauna's attendant. We're all looking after\nyou, Captain Linden. Did you know I performed an operation to relieve\nthe pressure on your brain? You must get well, Captain.\" The words of\nCampbell came through insistently.\n  \n \n  After a silence that may have lasted for hours or days, I said,\n\"Campbell, you haven't forgot the EGGWE Code?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Section Four?\"\n  \n \n  \"Section Four,\" he repeated in a low voice, as if to pacify me and put\nme to sleep. \"Conduct of EGGWE agents toward native inhabitants: A, No\nagent shall enter into any diplomatic agreement that shall be construed\nas binding\u2014\"\n  \n \n  I interrupted. \"Clause D?\"\n  \n \n  He picked it up. \"D, no agent shall enter into a marriage contract with\nany native.... H-m-m. You're not trying to warn me, are you, Captain\nLinden? Or are you warning\n   \n   yourself\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  At that moment my eyes opened a little. Swimming before my blurred\nvision was the face of Vauna. I did remember her\u2014yes, she must have\nhaunted my dreams, for now my eyes burned in an effort to define her\nfeatures more clearly. This was indeed Vauna, who had been one of the\nparty of twelve, and had walked beside her father in the face of the\nattack. Deep within my subconscious the image of her beautiful face and\nfigure had lingered. I murmured a single word of answer to Campbell's\nquestion. \"Myself.\"\n  \n \n  In the hours that followed, I came to know the soft footsteps of Vauna.\nThe caverns in which she and her father and all these Benzendella\npeople lived were pleasantly warm and fragrant. My misty impressions of\ntheir life about me were like the first impressions of a child learning\nabout the world into which he has been born.\n  \n \n  Sometimes I would hear Vauna and her attendant Omosla talking together.\nOften when Campbell would stop in this part of the cavern to inquire\nabout me, Omosla would drop in also. She and Campbell were learning to\nconverse in simple words. And Vauna and I\u2014yes. If I could only avoid\nblacking out.\n  \n \n  I wanted to see her.\n  \n \n  So often my eyes would refuse to open. A thousand nightmares. Space\nships shooting through meteor swarms. Stars like eyes. Eyes like stars.\nThe eyes of Vauna, the daughter of Tomboldo. The sensitive stroke of\nVauna's fingers, brushing my forehead, pressing my hand.\n  \n \n  I regained my health gradually.\n  \n \n  \"Are you quite awake?\" Vauna would ask me in her musical Benzendella\nwords. \"You speak better today. Your friend Campbell has brought you\nmore recordings of our language, so you can learn to speak more. My\nfather is eager to talk with you. But you must sleep more. You are\nstill weak.\"\n  \n \n  It gave me a weird sensation to awaken in the night, trying to adjust\nmyself to my surroundings. The Benzendellas were sleep-singers. By\nnight they murmured mysterious little songs through their sleep.\nStrange harmonies whispered through the caves.\n  \n \n  And if I stirred restlessly, the footsteps of Vauna might come to me\nthrough the darkness. In her sleeping garments she would come to me,\nfaintly visible in the pink light that filtered through from some\ncorridor. She would whisper melodious Benzendella words and tell me to\ngo back to sleep, and I would drift into the darkness of my endless\ndreams.\n  \n \n  The day came when I awakened to see both Vauna and her father standing\nbefore me. Stern old Tomboldo, with his chalk-smooth face and not a\nhint of an eyebrow or eyelash, rapped his hand against my ribs, shook\nthe fiber bed lightly, and smiled. From a pocket concealed in his\nflowing cape, he drew forth the musical watch, touched the button, and\nplayed, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have learned to talk,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"You have had a long sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am well again. See, I can almost walk.\" But as I started to rise,\nthe wave of blackness warned me, and I restrained my ambition. \"I will\nwalk soon.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will have much to talk about. Your friend has pointed to the stars\nand told me a strange story of your coming. We have walked around the\nship. He has told me how it rides through the sky. I can hardly make\nmyself believe.\" Tomboldo's eyes cast upward under the strong ridge of\nforehead where the eyebrows should have been. He was evidently trying\nto visualize the flight of a space ship. \"We will have much to tell\neach other.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" I said. \"Campbell and I came to learn about the\n   \n   serpent\nriver\n   \n  .\" I resorted to my own language for the last two words, not\nknowing the Benzendella equivalent.\n   \n   I\n   \n  made an eel-like motion\nwith my arm. But they didn't understand. And before I could explain,\nthe footsteps of other Benzendellas approached, and presently I looked\naround to see that quite an audience had gathered. The most prominent\nfigure of the new group was the big muscular guard of the black and\ngreen diamond markings\u2014Gravgak.\n  \n \n  \"You get well?\" Gravgak said to me. His eyes drilled me closely.\n  \n \n  \"I get well,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"The blow on the head,\" he said, \"was not meant.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at him. Everyone was looking at him, and I knew this was meant\nto be an occasion of apology. But the light of fire in Vauna's eyes\ntold me that she did not believe. He saw her look, and his own eyes\nflashed darts of defiance. With an abrupt word to me, he wheeled and\nstarted off. \"Get well!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd of men and women made way for him. But in the arched doorway\nhe turned. \"Vauna. I am ready to speak to you alone.\"\n  \n \n  She started. I reached and barely touched her hand. She stopped. \"I\nwill talk with you later, Gravgak.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" he shouted. \"Alone.\"\n  \n \n  He stalked off. A moment later Vauna, after exchanging a word with her\nfather, excused herself from the crowd and followed Gravgak.\n  \n \n  From the way those in the room looked, I knew this must be a dramatic\nmoment. It was as if she had acknowledged Gravgak as her master\u2014or her\nlover. He had called for her. She had followed.\n  \n \n  But her old father was still the master. He stepped toward the door.\n\"Vauna!... Gravgak!... Come back.\"\n  \n \n  (I will always wonder what might have happened if he hadn't called\nthem! Was my distrust of Gravgak justified? Had I become merely a\njealous lover\u2014or was I right in my hunch that the tall muscular guard\nwas a potential traitor?)\n  \n \n  Vauna reappeared at once. I believe she was glad that she had been\ncalled back.\n  \n \n  Gravgak came sullenly. At the edge of the crowd in the arched doorway\nhe stood scowling.\n  \n \n  \"While we are together,\" old Tomboldo said quietly, looking around at\nthe assemblage, \"I must tell you the decision of the council. Soon we\nwill move back to the other part of the world.\"\n  \n \n  There were low murmurs of approval through the chamber.\n  \n \n  \"We will wait a few days,\" Tomboldo went on, \"until our new friend\u2014\"\nhe pointed to me\u2014\"is well enough to travel. We would never leave him\nhere to the mercy of the savage ones. He and his helper came through\nthe sky in time to save us from being destroyed. We must never forget\nthis kindness.

Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n  \n \n  \"Captain\u2014\n   \n   Jim\n   \n  ! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n  \n \n  Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell\u2014to do something\u2014anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n  \n \n  Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n  \n \n  \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split\n   \n   could\n   \n  drop his\ndignity under excitement\u2014his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n  \n \n  We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n  \n \n  \"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  Split touched the number sixteen signal.\n  \n \n  The ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n  \n \n  You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n  \n \n  \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n  \n \n  Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few\u2014the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group\u2014came with him.\n  \n \n  \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n  \n \n  Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n  \n \n  We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n  \n \n  Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n  \n \n  Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth\u2014handsome\u2014attractive.\"\n  \n \n  Then the siren went off.\n  \n \n  The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n  \n \n  I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n  \n \n  \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n  \n \n  Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n  \n \n  We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n  \n \n  Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n  \n \n  By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose\u2014to\nunderstand the Serpent River\u2014would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course\u2014these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n  \n \n  Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n  \n \n  \"Wollo\u2014yeeta\u2014vo\u2014vandartch\u2014vandartch! Grr\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\"\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o,\" one of the others echoed.\n  \n \n  It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\"\nwe were all safe.\n  \n \n  Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"\n   \n   See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n  \n \n  Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n  \n \n  I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n  \n \n  The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n  \n \n  Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na\n   \n   warning\n   \n  ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n  \n \n  I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip\u2014BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened\u2014and those who were able, ran.\n  \n \n  They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n  \n \n  But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n  \n \n  His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it\u2014and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him\u2014apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n  \n \n  I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.\n  \n"

        "Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind!

It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n  \n \n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n  \n \n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n  \n \n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n  \n \n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n  \n \n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n  \n \n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n  \n \n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n  \n \n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n  \n \n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n  \n \n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n  \n \n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n  \n \n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said.\n  \n \n"

        "Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU\n   \n  can alter the course of your life!\n  \n \n  Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages!\n  \n \n  The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth\n  \n \n  POSAT\n  \n \n  an ancient secret society\n  \n \n  Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university.

Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters.

Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius.

Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n  \n \n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n  \n \n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n  \n \n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n  \n \n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n  \n \n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n  \n \n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n  \n \n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n  \n \n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n  \n \n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n  \n \n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n  \n \n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n  \n \n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n"

A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then he\nsaw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the\nblue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the\ntiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could\nhardly have been fifteen.\n  \n \n  The TV was saying, \"... in addition, a number of mysterious\ndisappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These\nare thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension,\nand impulse traveling\u2014a result of the unusual stresses of the time.\nFinally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe,\nespecially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods'\nand in some way responsible for current events.\n  \n \n  \"It is thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining\ncasually, \"Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over\nfor him.\" When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced,\n\"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen,\" and squeezed herself a glass of\npomegranate juice.\n  \n \n  The monkeylike figure muttered, \"Scotch-and-soda,\" then turned toward\nEdmund and asked, \"And what is your reaction to all this, sir?\"\n  \n"

He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\nreceiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\nstanding or sitting?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\nthe training.\n  \n \n  He hoped they were right.\n  \n \n  The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\nwasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\nshall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\nship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't\n   \n   ended\n   \n  , nor did it\nmean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\nalive.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\ncorrectly.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But it is not\u2014not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\nknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\nthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\nRuler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\nthe Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\nlogic\"\u2014the Tr'en word seemed to mean\n   \n   right-saying\n   \n  \u2014\"who will advise\nthe Ruler. They will be called.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\nthat their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\ngestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n  \n \n  The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\nus,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"\u2014\n   \n   chulad-like\n   \n  Korvin\ntranslated\u2014\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin devoutly hoped so.\n  \n"

        "The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight\n   \n   short\n   \n  days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his\nmother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed\nrapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.\n  \n \n  Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence\nwas a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age\nan inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.\n  \n \n  Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his\nfather now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.\n  \n \n  This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every\nsecond of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.\n  \n \n \n   Because in a few hours they'd be dead.\n   \n \n \n  This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal\nstate hadn't he dreamed of\n   \n   long\n   \n  lives, valleys not of blasted stone\nbut green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then\nthere must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long\nlife? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and\ndepressing in eight short, vanishing days?\n  \n \n  How had his people gotten into such a condition?\n  \n \n  As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across\nspace from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing\non this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\n  \n \n  When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs\nfrom the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the\nhuge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon\na forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,\ntwo hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins\nthickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were\nborn in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this\nworld's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a\nweek, leaving children to do likewise.\n  \n \n  So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for\nhe knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a\ntelepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five\nthousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself\nfrom dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\n  \n \n  His eyes widened, another image came to focus.\n  \n \n  Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,\nunscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the\navalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship\nof all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But\nit was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on\nthe far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was\nhis only hope of escape.\n  \n \n  His mind flexed.\n  \n \n  In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful\nof scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he\nmust go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys\nand temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant\nship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or\nage.\n  \n \n  The cliff groaned.\n  \n \n  Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n  \n \n  \"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of\nthe Avalanche.\n  \n \n  The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with\neager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard\na rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.\nStones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for\na million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their\njourney as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a\nthousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\n  \n \n  Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\n  \n \n  The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to\ntheir lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\n  \n \n  Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down\nthe tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There\nwas a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He\nsensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,\nbringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she\ncried to her husband.\n  \n \n  Sim felt his father crouch, listening.\n  \n \n  High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\n  \n \n  An avalanche fell down at them!\n  \n \n  Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His\nmother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\n  \n \n  With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The\navalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and\nDark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders\nthat weighed a hundred pounds each.\n  \n \n  The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.\nSim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it\nalive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\n  \n \n  Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her\nhusband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n  \n \n  \"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\n  \n \n  Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an\navalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from\nunder a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing\nelse to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\n  \n \n  Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\n  \n \n  The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven\nwas a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor\nthe bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining\nstars.\n  \n \n  This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent\ntemperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and\nits life moved abroad.\n  \n \n  Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his\npeople find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\n  \n \n  The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing\nin the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It\nflowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.\nSeconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.\nFather gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile\ncrop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at\nhis waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's\ntongue.\n  \n \n  His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge\nthirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,\nselfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One\nthing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind\nlike a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for\nexplanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden\nof food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like\na bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,\ncomplete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew\nexcited with his ability.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I can't take the time to explain it all. I have too much to do. Just\nthree of us\u2014myself and my two sons. My wife lost her mind. I should\nhave helped her as I'm helping you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Harry said. \"I remember people, and things, and\nwhere are they now? Dead? People can die, but farms, cities....\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the time,\" the doctor repeated, voice rising. \"I have to run\na world. Three of us, to run a world! I built it as best I could, but\nhow large could I make it? The money. The years and years of work. The\npeople calling me insane when they found out ... but a few giving me\nmore money, and the work going on. And those few caught like everyone\nelse, unprepared when the holocaust started, unprepared and unable to\nreach my world. So they died. As I knew they would. As they should have\nknown they would.\"\n  \n \n  Harry felt the rumbling beneath him. Engines?\n  \n \n  \"You survived,\" the doctor said. \"Your wife. A few hundred others in\nthe rural areas. One other family in your area. I survived because\nI lived for survival, like a mole deep in the earth, expecting the\ncatastrophe every minute. I survived because I gave up living to\nsurvive.\" He laughed, high and thin.\n  \n \n  His son said, \"Please, Dad....\"\n  \n \n  \"No! I want to talk to someone\n   \n   sane\n   \n  ! You and Petey and I\u2014we're all\ninsane, you know. Three years now, playing God, waiting for some land,\nany land, to become habitable. And knowing everything, and surrounded\nby people who are sane only because I made sure they would know\nnothing.\" He stepped forward, glaring at Harry. \"Now do you understand?\nI went across the country, picking up a few of the few left alive. Most\nwere farmers, and even where some weren't I picked the farmers anyway.\nBecause farmers are what we'll need, and all the rest can evolve later.\nI put you and the others, eighty-six all told, from every section of\nthe country, on my world, the only uncontaminated land left. I gave\nyou back your old lives. I couldn't give you big crops because we\ndon't need big crops. We would only exhaust our limited soil with big\ncrops. But I gave you vegetable gardens and livestock and, best of all,\n   \n   sanity\n   \n  ! I wiped the insane moments from your minds. I gave you peace\nand consigned myself, my sons, my own wife....\"\n  \n \n  He choked and stopped.\n  \n \n  Stan ran across the room to the switch. Harry watched him, and his\nbrain struggled with an impossible concept. He heard the engines and\nremembered the ocean on two sides; on four sides had he bothered to\ncheck south and east; on\n   \n   all\n   \n  sides if that fence continued to curve\ninward. Ocean, and there was no ocean in Iowa.\n  \n \n  And this wasn't Iowa.\n  \n \n \n   The explosions had ripped the world, and he'd tried to get to town to\nsave Davie, and there'd been no town and there'd been no people and\nthere'd been only death and poison in the air and even those few people\nleft had begun to die, and then the truck with the huge trailer had\ncome, the gleaming trailer with the little man and his trembling wife\nand his two sons....\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before\nme. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring\npersonality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional\ncontinuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\n  \n \n  And found it.\n  \n \n  As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity\nof static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the\nprobing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried\nmotivations.\n  \n \n  I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   It is a contact, Effulgent One!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the\nthreshold....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating\ntrough!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the\nvoices\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably\nintricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had\nconcretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought\nagainst the intruding stimuli\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrust\nof the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor\ncenters, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated\ncontrol compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking\nthe way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\u2014and then the\nhatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.\nMy blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as\nthe lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\u2014and the\nworld-ending impact as I fell.\n  \n \n  At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality\nlashed out again\u2014fighting the invader.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend\nthe last filament of your life-force!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention\nare instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction\nfollowed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in\nmy subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its\npassage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\u2014at a conscious level.\n  \n \n  Watching the Gool mind, I learned.\n  \n \n  The insinuating probe\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had\ntheorized\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\n  \n \n  But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had\nbeen done to me.\n  \n \n  Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping\nand manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin\ncrystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning\nthemselves.\n  \n \n  Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand\nto pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable\nvoid\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a\nglistening dark shape.\n  \n \n  There was a soundless shriek. \"\n   \n   Effulgence! It reached out\u2014touched\nme!\n   \n  \"\n  \n"

You remember how it was then;\nhow everybody looked forward to his new designation, and how everybody\nmade jokes about the way the letters came out, and how all the records\nwere for a while fouled up beyond recognition.\n  \n \n  The telecomics kidded renumbering. One went a little too far and\nthey psycho-scanned him and then sent him to Marscol as a dangerous\nnonconform.\n  \n \n  If you were disappointed with your new designation, you didn't\ncomplain. You didn't want a sudden visit from the Deacons during the\nnight.\n  \n \n  There had to be renumbering. We all understood that.

Now, to\naddress somebody by calling off four letters is a little clumsy. We try\nto pronounce them when they are pronounceable. That is, no one says to\nStateleader, \"Good morning, A-A-A-A.\" They say, \"Good morning, Aaaa.\"\n  \n \n  Reading the last quote, I notice a curious effect.

I needed\nevery possible thing in my favor.\n  \n \n  Yes, I still hoped for a job, even after two years. I still meant to\nkeep on plugging, making the rounds.\n  \n \n  I'd go out again today.\n  \n \n  The timer clicked and my egg was ready. I swallowed the tablets and\nthen took the egg to the table to savor it and make it last.\n  \n \n  As I leaned forward to sit, the metal tag dangled from my neck,\ncatching the glowlight. My identity tag.\n  \n \n  Everything came back in a rush\u2014\n  \n \n  My name. The dream and\n   \n   her\n   \n  voice. And her suggestion.\n  \n \n \n   Would I dare? Would I start out this very morning and take the risk,\nthe terrible risk?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Peter forced himself forward another step. Little Harry Kanin,\nLorelei's assistant, was crumpled in a corner, half supported by the\nbroad base of an X-ray chamber. His face was flaccid and bloated. His\nglazed eyes, impassive yet somehow pleading, stared at nothingness\nstraight ahead of him.\n  \n \n  The Invaders ignored Peter, staring expressionlessly down at Kanin.\nIn a moment Peter realized what they were doing to him. He stood,\nparalyzed with horror, and watched it happen.\n  \n \n  The little man's body was sagging, ever so slowly, as if he were\nrelaxing tiredly. His torso was telescoping, bit by bit; his spread\nlegs grew wider and more shapeless, his cheeks caved in and his skull\ngrew gradually flatter.\n  \n \n  When it was over, the thing that had been Kanin was a limp, boneless\npuddle of flesh. Peter could not look at it.\n  \n \n  There was a scream in his throat that would not come out. He was beyond\nfear, beyond agony. He turned to the still-hovering monsters and said\nin a terrible voice, \"Why? Why?\"\n  \n \n  The nearest being turned slowly to regard him. Its lips did not move,\nbut there was a tiny sound in Peter's brain, a thin, dry whispering.\n  \n \n  The scream was welling up. He fought it down and listened.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Wurnkomellilonasendiktolsasangkanmiamiamimami....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The face was staring directly into his, the bulging eyes hypnotic. The\nears were small, no more than excresences of skin. The narrow lips\nseemed sealed together; a thin, slimy ichor drooled from them. There\nwere lines in the face, but they were lines of age, not emotion. Only\nthe eyes were alive.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   ... raswilopreatadvuonistuwurncchtusanlgkelglawwalinom....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"I can't understand,\" he cried wildly. \"What do you want?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   ... morofelcovisyanmamiwurlectaunntous.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  He heard a faint sound behind him, and whirled. It was the first\ntime he had realized that Lorelei had followed him. She stood there,\nswaying, very pale, looking at the red Invaders. Her eyes swiveled\nslowly....\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Opreniktoulestritifenrelngetnaktwiltoctpre.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  His voice was hoarse. \"Don't look! Don't\u2014Go back!\" The horrible,\nmindless noise in his throat was almost beyond his power to repress.\nHis insides writhed to thrust it out.\n  \n \n  She didn't see him. Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\nfloor.\n  \n \n  The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\nit back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\nfingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\nthe room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\n  \n"

        "The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before\nme. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring\npersonality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional\ncontinuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\n  \n \n  And found it.\n  \n \n  As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity\nof static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the\nprobing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried\nmotivations.\n  \n \n  I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   It is a contact, Effulgent One!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Softly, now!

I listened to the\nvoices\u2014yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably\nintricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had\nconcretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought\nagainst the intruding stimuli\u2014then yielded under the relentless thrust\nof the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor\ncenters, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated\ncontrol compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking\nthe way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me\u2014and then the\nhatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.\nMy blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as\nthe lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought\u2014and the\nworld-ending impact as I fell.\n  \n \n  At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality\nlashed out again\u2014fighting the invader.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord.

Cling, though you expend\nthe last filament of your life-force!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention\nare instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction\nfollowed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in\nmy subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its\npassage, to leave me unaware of its tampering\u2014at a conscious level.\n  \n \n  Watching the Gool mind, I learned.\n  \n \n  The insinuating probe\u2014a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had\ntheorized\u2014was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\n  \n \n  But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had\nbeen done to me.\n  \n \n  Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping\nand manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin\ncrystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning\nthemselves.\n  \n \n  Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand\nto pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable\nvoid\u2014and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a\nglistening dark shape.\n  \n \n  There was a soundless shriek. \"\n   \n   Effulgence!

They found\nthe guard's rifle, and they're looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan,\nwith those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came\nfor you.

The time was almost up\u2014the bomb\nin the car\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Go away!\" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and\nswinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before\nsomething immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted\nfrom the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force\nonto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the\nsound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to\nfeel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....\n  \n \n  The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. \"He's still alive,\" he said\ncallously to Lowry, who had just come up. \"It won't last long, though.\nWhat've you got there?\"\n  \n \n  Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two\nhalves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a\nconnection had been broken. \"He had a bomb,\" he said. \"A magnetic-type,\ndelayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car,\nand it went off. They\u2014they were planning to bomb us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Amazing,\" the surgeon said dryly. \"Well, they won't do any bombing\nnow.\"\n  \n \n  Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered.\nThe surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Better them than us,\" he said. \"It's poetic justice if I ever saw it.\nThey had it coming....\" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of\npaper between his fingers. \"This is the only part I don't get,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What's that?\" Lowry craned his neck. \"A piece of paper with a cross on\nit? What about it?\"\n  \n \n  The surgeon shrugged. \"He had it clenched in his hand,\" he said. \"Had\nthe devil of a time getting it loose from him.\" He turned it over\nslowly, displayed the other side. \"Now what in the world would he be\ndoing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me. When his\nship returns, I'll be going to him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why aren't you with him now?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been\nstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of\nInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself.

The distributor takes\nyour coupon book and is all ready to reach for your package\u2014and then\nhe sees the fatal letters N/P. Non-Producer. A drone, a drain upon the\nState.

You know what happens when you try to\nchange something already on the records. The very idea of wanting\nchange implies criticism of the State. Unthinkable behavior.\n  \n \n  That was why this curious dream voice shocked me so. The thing that it\nsuggested was quite as embarrassing as its non-standard, emotional,\nprovocative tone.\n  \n \n  Bear with me; I'm getting to the voice\u2014to\n   \n   her\n   \n  \u2014in a moment.\n  \n \n  I want to tell you first about the loneliness, the terrible loneliness.\nI could hardly join group games at any of the rec centers. I could join\nno special interest clubs or even State Loyalty chapters. Although I\ndabbled with theoretical research in my own quarters, I could scarcely\nsubmit any findings for publication\u2014not with my name attached. A\npseudonym would have been non-regulation and illegal.\n  \n \n  But there was the worst thing of all. I could not mate.\n  \n"

Her eyes glazed, and she dropped limply to the\nfloor.\n  \n \n  The scream came out then. Before he knew, even, that he could hold\nit back no longer, his mouth was wide open, his muscles tensed, his\nfingernails slicing his palms. It echoed with unbelievable volume in\nthe room. It was a scream to split eardrums; a scream to wake the dead.\n  \n"

Sparks was a stunted, usually-grinning, little redhead\nnamed Hannigan. But he wasn't grinning now. He laid an anxious hand on\nGreg's arm. \"If I was you,\" he said, \"if I was you, Malcolm, I don't\nthink I'd say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  Greg said, \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  Sparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering.\n  \n \n  \"Well, for one thing, it ain't important.

Then he stopped, studied his\ncompanion thoughtfully, nodded. \"O.Q.,\" he confessed, \"that's it. But\nwe ain't licked yet. We got three good men on the bridge. Townsend ...\nGraves ... Langhorn. They'll pull out of this if anybody can. And they\nain't no sense in scaring the Old Man and his family.\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't tell them,\" said Greg. \"I won't tell them unless I have to.\nBut between you and me, what are the odds against us, Sparks?\"\n  \n \n  The radioman shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Who knows? Vortices are unpredictable. Maybe the damn thing will toss\nus out on the very spot it picked us up. Maybe it will give us the old\nchuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crack\nus up on an asteroid or satellite.

He took off his spectacles, breathed on them,\nwiped them, replaced them. He was tall and fair; in his neat, crisply\npressed business suit he appeared even slimmer than he was. But there\nwas no nervousness in his movements. He moved measuredly. \"Well,\" he\nsaid, \"that appears to be that. I'm going up to the dining dome.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks stared at him querulously.\n  \n \n  \"You're a queer duck, Malcolm.

He stared after the other man\nwonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks,\nshaking his head and muttering.\n  \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters.

        "It was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\n  \n \n  And now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n  \n \n  \"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\n  \n \n  What happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\n  \n \n  The misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\n  \n \n  In the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\n  \n \n  Then Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\n  \n<doc-sep>Hannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\n  \n \n  \"What? Oh, you mean\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\n  \n \n  \"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\neverything. Anyhow\u2014\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean\n   \n   anything\n   \n  .\" He\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\nhero\u2014for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\nspur without a squawk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Malcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\n  \n \n  Sparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\n  \n \n  The gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\n  \n \n  J. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\nwho\u2014as Greg watched\u2014stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\nedibles.\n  \n \n  'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was\n   \n   so\n   \n  hungry)!\n  \n \n  Bert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\n  \n \n  \"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        "Maud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"\n   \n   That?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  She glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\n  \n \n  Greg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\n  \n \n  Enid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\n  \n \n  \"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\n  \n \n  \"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It\u2014it\u2014shouldn't stay\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\n  \n \n  Breadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\n  \n \n  \"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\n  \n \n  Greg said, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near\u2014\" Breadon\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\nit off easily. \"Oh, well\u2014a change of scenery, what?\"\n  \n \n  But the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\n  \n \n  \"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there\u2014danger?\"\n  \n \n  But Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\nCrystal's older brother.\n  \n \n  \"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\nyou folks\u2014are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\neven see\u2014and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\n  \n \n  The proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n  \n \n  \"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\n  \n \n  Bert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n  \n \n  \"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do\u2014hide the bad news from\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\n  \n \n  J. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n  \n \n  \"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\n  \n \n  Greg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\n  \n \n  Maud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n  \n \n  \"Is there anything we can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n  \n \n  \"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n  \n \n  \"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n  \n \n  \"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\n   \n   quick\n   \n  ! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Those next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\n  \n \n  He was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\n  \n \n  J. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\n  \n \n  Then the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\n  \n \n  Sense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\n  \n \n  Somewhere in space. He looked through the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  . What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Like a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\n  \n \n  For an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  ; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  was accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\n  \n \n  And Greg Malcolm turned from the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , shaken.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\n  \n \n  Then a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Maud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"\n   \n   That?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  She glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\n  \n \n  Greg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\n  \n \n  Enid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\n  \n \n  \"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\n  \n \n  \"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It\u2014it\u2014shouldn't stay\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\n  \n \n  Breadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\n  \n \n  \"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\n  \n \n  Greg said, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near\u2014\" Breadon\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\nit off easily. \"Oh, well\u2014a change of scenery, what?\"\n  \n \n  But the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\n  \n \n  \"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there\u2014danger?\"\n  \n \n  But Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\nCrystal's older brother.\n  \n \n  \"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\nyou folks\u2014are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\neven see\u2014and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\n  \n \n  The proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews\u2014\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\nroar at his only son.\n  \n \n  \"Bert\u2014you're drunk!\"\n  \n \n  Bert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\n  \n \n  \"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do\u2014hide the bad news from\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\n  \n \n  J. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\nonly deep concern in his voice.\n  \n \n  \"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\n  \n \n  Greg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger\u2014but\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\n  \n \n  Maud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\n  \n \n  \"Is there anything we can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\n  \n \n  \"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\n  \n \n  \"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\nsafety.\n  \n \n  \"Everybody\u2014the Number Four life-skiff\u2014\n   \n   quick\n   \n  ! We've been caught in a\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Those next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\ncradled there.\n  \n \n  He was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\nthey charged on down the corridor.\n  \n \n  J. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\n  \n \n  Then the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\nescape.\n  \n \n  Sense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\n  \n \n  Somewhere in space. He looked through the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  . What he saw then\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Like a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\n  \n \n  For an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  ; a\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\nsure, and then the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  was accelerating with such violence and\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\n  \n \n  And Greg Malcolm turned from the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , shaken.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\n  \n \n  Hannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\ncaught?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\n  \n \n  Then a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\nnow, Malcolm.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n"

        " \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the\nobvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn\u2019t very extensive\u2014a\nrocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson\u2019s\ncrew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed\nthe Solar \u2019scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years\nbefore.\n  \n \n  Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside,\nof course\u2014the Sun was Sanderson\u2019s baby and he\u2019d picked\nMercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could\nhold his observatory. He\u2019d chosen a good location, too. On\nMercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770\u00b0 F. at perihelion\nand the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410\u00b0 F. No permanent\ninstallation with a human crew could survive at either\nextreme. But with Mercury\u2019s wobble, the twilight zone between\nBrightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival\ntemperatures.\n  \n \n  Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone\nis about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to\n60 degrees with the libration. The Solar \u2019scope could take that\nmuch change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun\nfor about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet\nto wheel around.\n  \n \n  The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something\nabout Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab\nto make final preparations.\n  \n \n  Sanderson did. He thought we\u2019d lost our minds and he said\nso, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week\nbriefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had\narrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.\nPoor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson\nhad given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside\nwas like.\n  \n \n  Stone was a youngster\u2014hardly twenty-five, I\u2019d say\u2014but\nhe\u2019d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join\nthis trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn\u2019t care for\nexploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed\nhim around like a puppy.\n  \n \n  It didn\u2019t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting\nin for. You don\u2019t go asking people in this game why they do it\u2014they\u2019re\nliable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can\never give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had\nborrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and\nequipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check\nand test.\n  \n \n  We dug right in. With plenty of funds\u2014tri-V money and\nsome government cash the Major had talked his way around\u2014our\nequipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing\nand testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.\nWe had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,\nwith special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,\nand one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.\n  \n \n  The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he\nsaid, \u201cHave you heard anything from McIvers?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d Stone wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining us. He\u2019s a good man\u2014got quite a name\nfor climbing, back home.\u201d The Major turned to me. \u201cYou\u2019ve\nprobably heard of him.\u201d\n  \n \n  I\u2019d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn\u2019t\ntoo happy to hear that he was joining us. \u201cKind of a daredevil,\nisn\u2019t he?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe. He\u2019s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the\nline? We\u2019ll need plenty of both.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHave you ever worked with him?\u201d I asked.\n  \n \n  \u201cNo. Are you worried?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to worry about\nMcIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the\ntrip to him and we\u2019re going to need each other too much to\ndo any fooling around.\u201d He turned back to the supply list.\n\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s get this stuff listed and packed. We\u2019ll need\nto cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says\nwe should leave in three days.\u201d\n  \n \n  Two days later, McIvers hadn\u2019t arrived. The Major didn\u2019t\nsay much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We\nspent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as\nthey were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so\nfar out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They\nshowed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and\nthat was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline\nof our course.\n  \n \n  \u201cThis range here,\u201d the Major said as we crowded around\nthe board, \u201cis largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But\nthese to the south and west\n   \n   could\n   \n  be active. Seismograph\ntracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse\ndown toward the equator\u2014not only volcanic, but sub-surface\nshifting.\u201d\n  \n \n  Stone nodded. \u201cSanderson told me there was probably constant\nsurface activity.\u201d\n  \n \n  The Major shrugged. \u201cWell, it\u2019s treacherous, there\u2019s no\ndoubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the\nPole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of\nless activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could\nfind a pass through this range and cut sharp east\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the\nfurther we got from a solution. We knew there were active\nvolcanoes on the Brightside\u2014even on the Darkside, though\nsurface activity there was pretty much slowed down and\nlocalized.\n  \n \n  But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as\nwell. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric\nflow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much\u2014the lighter gases\nhad reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside\nmillennia ago\u2014but there was CO\n  2\n  , and nitrogen, and traces of\nother heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur\nvapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.\n  \n \n  The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it\ncondensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson\nto estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on\nBrightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage\nthat avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final\nanalysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way\nwe would find out what was happening where was to be there.\n  \n \n  Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight\nrocket from Venus. He\u2019d missed the ship that the Major and\nI had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus\nin hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn\u2019t seem too upset\nabout it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and\nhe couldn\u2019t see why everyone should get so excited.\n  \n \n  He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely\ngray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber\u2019s\u2014half-closed,\nsleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.\nAnd he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing\nsomething with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.\n  \n \n  Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his\narrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were\nrunning the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,\nStone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was\nset for an early departure after we got some rest.\n  \n<doc-sep>Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n  \n \n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n  \n"

Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\na halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\nmechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\nHe mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\nin the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\nfar enough to admit him.\n  \n \n  Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\non her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\nblonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n  \n \n  \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\nThen she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned. \"Why, no\u2014Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\nhours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\"\n  \n \n  She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete,\nyou know I haven't one\u2014it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether\nthere's trouble or not. What\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n  \n \n  She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\nwalked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\npapers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\nand pressed the stud.\n  \n \n  A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\nsuddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n  \n \n  Lorelei caught her breath.\n  \n \n  It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\nthe warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\ntransport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\nbeen dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\nyes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\ndisappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\nheartbeat they were gone.\n  \n \n  There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\ndefiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\nflesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\nmen and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\njoined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\nhelpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\nhorrible than any cry of agony.\n  \n \n  \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\nstrangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\nstreets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\n  \n"

But the horror\n    \n   is the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n   \n \n \n \n  \"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n  \n \n  \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\n  \n \n  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\n  \n \n  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\n   \n   could\n   \n  walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\n  \n \n  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n  \n \n  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n  \n \n  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n  \n \n  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n  \n \n  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\n  \n \n  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n  \n<doc-sep>Obediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\n  \n \n  The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\n  \n \n  Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n  \n \n  \"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\n  \n \n  The lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\n  \n \n  It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\n  \n \n  He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n  \n \n  \"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the\nbasis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long\njourney, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go\nto Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the\ncompany that employed him, and possibly not even to them.\n  \n \n  The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his\nmission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money\nwasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What\n   \n   did\n   \n  the\nthug want?\n  \n \n  Secrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was\ntoo well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for\nanyone this far away to have learned about it.\n  \n \n  And yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as\ndead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't\ninvolve too much risk.\n  \n \n  \"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of\nthat boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually\nwas on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives\nlike rain.\n  \n \n  He adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the\nrain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it\nunhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility\nand the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the\nnear amphibians who created it.\n  \n \n  A few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport\ntide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made\nlife dangerous for a human\u2014Venice revised, brought up to date in a\nfaster-than-light age.\n  \n \n  Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely\nflexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the\nribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout\nthe city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly\nand noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human\u2014Cassal shivered.\nIf he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No\ninvestigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had\ncertainly picked the right place.\n  \n \n  The Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal\nwas almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by.\nWhat she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.\n  \n \n  \"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at\ncloser range.\"\n  \n"

        "\"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation,\nis near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've\ncovered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything\nwithin a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer\ndistances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly,\nCassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on\nor near Godolph. Within the next five years\u2014maybe.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local\ntransportation, star-hopping?\"\n  \n \n  \"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't need that kind of luck.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the\nemphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help\nyou. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification\ntab.\"\n  \n \n  \"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual\nspeaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood\nmade in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it\nplainly, because it was virtually inside his ear.\n  \n \n  Cassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it\nwith me. In fact, I may have lost it.\"\n  \n \n  She smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any\npart of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier\nfor us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't\n   \n   remember\n   \n  your real name and where you put your identification\u2014\" She\narose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\"\n  \n \n  He glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His\n   \n   real\n   \n  name!\n  \n \n  \"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\"\n  \n \n  Presently she returned.\n  \n \n  \"I have news for you, whoever you are.\"\n  \n \n  \"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you\ndon't believe it, send back to\u2014\" He stopped. It had taken him four\nmonths to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for\na ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances\nsuch as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for\nanything.\n  \n \n  \"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The\nspaceport records indicate that when\n   \n   Rickrock C\n   \n  took off this\nmorning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who\nhad tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became\nclear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten\nit.\n  \n \n  \"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to\nunderstand what galactic travel entails.\"\n  \n \n  Outsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second\ntransfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond\nthe first ring, called Rimmers? Probably.\n  \n<doc-sep>Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had.

        "\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n<doc-sep>The woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n  \n \n  \"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\n  \n \n  She nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\n  \n \n  He stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n  \n \n  \"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\n  \n \n  Irony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n  \n \n  \"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The\ninstrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large.\nFrom the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that\ninformation at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he\ncould get. Dimanche was his special advantage.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can\nalways find something in that line.\"\n  \n \n  \"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the\nMilky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't\nyet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better\nas a salesman.\"\n  \n \n  He got up, glowering. \"If that's all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot\nprovided for that purpose as you leave.\"\n  \n \n  A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle,\nswung open. The agency was efficient.\n  \n \n  \"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is\nhard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was\nalso eminently practical.\n  \n \n  The exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable\ncontribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the\nbureau.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\n  \n \n  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\n  \n \n  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\n   \n   could\n   \n  walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\n  \n \n  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n  \n \n  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n  \n \n  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n  \n \n  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n  \n \n  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\n  \n \n  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR\n  \n \n  By DONALD E. WESTLAKE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEST\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine October 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n \n   He was dangerously insane. He threatened\n    \n   to destroy everything that was noble and\n    \n   decent\u2014including my date with my girl!\n   \n \n \n \n  When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken\negg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window\nsticking at full transparency\u2014well, I won't go through the whole sorry\nlist. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put\nthe roof on the city, as they say.\n  \n \n  It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're\nlucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n  \n \n  But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been\nbuilding my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my\nmind to do it\u2014to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this\nmorning\u2014right after the egg yolk\u2014and invited myself down to her\nplace. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the\nphone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten\no'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n  \n \n  Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a\nharridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a\nfixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,\nof course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,\nwere invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one\nwaited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other\nProject and had blown itself up.\n  \n \n  Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three\nyears, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,\nshortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five\nminutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been\nkilled. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from\narriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had\nhappened\u2014I'd broken a shoe lace\u2014she refused to speak to me for four\ndays.\n  \n \n  And then the elevator didn't come.\n  \n<doc-sep>The secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye\nand grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\n  \n \n  \"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\" Arapoulous\nobserved. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time\nto time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\" Retief inquired.\n  \n \n  Arapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"A hundred would help,\" he said. \"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you say to two thousand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Two thousand? Retief, you're not fooling?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope not.\" He picked up the phone, called the Port Authority, asked\nfor the dispatch clerk.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Jim. Say, I have a favor to ask of you. You know that\ncontingent of Bogan students. They're traveling aboard the two CDT\ntransports. I'm interested in the baggage that goes with the students.\nHas it arrived yet? Okay, I'll wait.\"\n  \n \n  Jim came back to the phone. \"Yeah, Retief, it's here. Just arrived.\nBut there's a funny thing. It's not consigned to d'Land. It's ticketed\nclear through to Lovenbroy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen, Jim,\" Retief said. \"I want you to go over to the warehouse and\ntake a look at that baggage for me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief waited while the dispatch clerk carried out the errand. The\nlevel in the two bottles had gone down an inch when Jim returned to\nthe phone.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, I took a look at that baggage, Retief. Something funny going on.\nGuns. 2mm needlers, Mark XII hand blasters, power pistols\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It's okay, Jim. Nothing to worry about. Just a mix-up. Now, Jim,\nI'm going to ask you to do something more for me. I'm covering for a\nfriend. It seems he slipped up. I wouldn't want word to get out, you\nunderstand. I'll send along a written change order in the morning that\nwill cover you officially. Meanwhile, here's what I want you to do....\"\n  \n \n  Retief gave instructions, then rang off and turned to Arapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"As soon as I get off a couple of TWX's, I think we'd better get down\nto the port, Hank. I think I'd like to see the students off personally.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  Karsh met Retief as he entered the Departures enclosure at the port.\n  \n \n  \"What's going on here?\" he demanded. \"There's some funny business with\nmy baggage consignment. They won't let me see it! I've got a feeling\nit's not being loaded.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd better hurry, Mr. Karsh,\" Retief said. \"You're scheduled to\nblast off in less than an hour. Are the students all loaded?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, blast you! What about my baggage? Those vessels aren't moving\nwithout it!\"\n  \n \n  \"No need to get so upset about a few toothbrushes, is there, Mr.\nKarsh?\" Retief said blandly. \"Still, if you're worried\u2014\" He turned to\nArapoulous.\n  \n \n  \"Hank, why don't you walk Mr. Karsh over to the warehouse and ...\nah ... take care of him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know just how to handle it,\" Arapoulous said.\n  \n \n  The dispatch clerk came up to Retief. \"I caught the tractor equipment,\"\nhe said. \"Funny kind of mistake, but it's okay now. They're being\noff-loaded at d'Land. I talked to the traffic controller there. He said\nthey weren't looking for any students.\"\n  \n \n  \"The labels got switched, Jim. The students go where the baggage was\nconsigned. Too bad about the mistake, but the Armaments Office will\nhave a man along in a little while to dispose of the guns. Keep an eye\nout for the luggage. No telling where it's gotten to.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here!\" a hoarse voice yelled. Retief turned. A disheveled figure in a\ntight hat was crossing the enclosure, arms waving.\n  \n \n  \"Hi there, Mr. Gulver,\" Retief called. \"How's Boge's business coming\nalong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Piracy!\" Gulver blurted as he came up to Retief, puffing hard. \"You've\ngot a hand in this, I don't doubt! Where's that Magnan fellow?\"\n  \n \n  \"What seems to be the problem?\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"Hold those transports! I've just been notified that the baggage\nshipment has been impounded. I'll remind you, that shipment enjoys\ndiplomatic free entry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Who told you it was impounded?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind! I have my sources!\"\n  \n \n  Two tall men buttoned into gray tunics came up. \"Are you Mr. Retief of\nCDT?\" one said.\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about my baggage!\" Gulver cut in. \"And I'm warning you, if those\nships lift without\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"These gentlemen are from the Armaments Control Commission,\" Retief\nsaid. \"Would you like to come along and claim your baggage, Mr. Gulver?\"\n  \n \n  \"From where? I\u2014\" Gulver turned two shades redder about the ears.\n\"Armaments?\"\n  \n \n  \"The only shipment I've held up seems to be somebody's arsenal,\" Retief\nsaid. \"Now if you claim this is your baggage....\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, impossible,\" Gulver said in a strained voice. \"Armaments?\nRidiculous. There's been an error....\"\n  \n"

        "\"Captain Gwayne, may I present your former friend, Captain Hennessy?\"\nBarker said. There was a grin on the doctor's lips, but his face was\ntaut with strain.\n  \n \n  The creature nodded slowly and drew something from the thick hair on\nits head. It was the golden comet of a captain.\n  \n \n  \"He never meant to hurt the kids\u2014just to talk to them,\" Barker cut in\nquickly. \"I've got some of the story. He's changed. He can't talk very\nwell. Says they've had to change the language around to make the sounds\nfit, and he's forgotten how to use what normal English he can. But it\ngets easier as you listen. It's Hennessy, all right. I'm certain.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne had his own ideas on that. It was easy for an alien to seize\non the gold ornament of a captive earthman, even to learn a little\nEnglish, maybe. But Hennessy had been his friend.\n  \n \n  \"How many barmaids in the Cheshire Cat? How many pups did your oldest\nkid's dog have? How many were brown?\"\n  \n \n  The lips contorted into something vaguely like a smile, and the\ncuriously shaped fingers that could handle no human-designed equipment\nspread out.\n  \n \n  Three. Seven. Zero.\n  \n \n  The answers were right.\n  \n \n  By the time the session was over, Gwayne had begun to understand the\ntwisted speech from inhuman vocal cords better. But the story took a\nlong time telling.\n  \n \n  When it was finished, Gwayne and Barker sat for long minutes in\nsilence. Finally Gwayne drew a shuddering breath and stood up. \"Is it\npossible, Doc?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Barker said flatly. He spread his hands and grimaced. \"No. Not\nby what I know. But it happened. I've looked at a few tissues under\nthe microscope. The changes are there. It's hard to believe about\ntheir kids. Adults in eight years, but they stay shorter. It can't be\na hereditary change\u2014the things that affect the body don't change the\ngerm plasm. But in this case, what changed Hennessy is real, so maybe\nthe fact that the change is passed on is as real as he claims.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne led the former Hennessy to the exit. The waiting blobs dropped\ndown to touch the monstrous man, then leaped up again. The crowd of\nmonsters began moving forward toward their leader. A few were almost as\ntall as Hennessy, but most were not more than five feet high.\n  \n \n  The kids of the exploring party....\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He\nrolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the\nevening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell\nof bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except\nthat she had discarded the white cloak.\n  \n \n  As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,\ncarrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her\nwith the word, \"Miss!\"\n  \n \n  She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n  \n \n  \"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last\nconsonant.\n  \n \n  \"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\n  \n \n  Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing\nforced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her\nshoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait! You mean you don't know?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\n  \n \n  She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.\n  \n"

        "The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\n  \n \n  Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\n  \n \n  The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\n  \n \n  Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\n  \n \n  The burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\n  \n \n  Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\n  \n \n  From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\n  \n<doc-sep>Jorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\n  \n \n  Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\n  \n \n  Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n  \n \n  \"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\n  \n \n  Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\n  \n \n  Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\n  \n<doc-sep>Meanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\n  \n \n  He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\n  \n \n  For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\n  \n \n  Until he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\n  \n \n  The question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\n  \n \n  He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he began to tape again.\n  \n \n  \"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name.

Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb. They tenderly touched\nthe rosy skin and strawberry bruises on the naked shoulders of a\ngirl sleeping off a drunk on the furry and radiantly heated floor of\na nearby roof garden. They struck green magic from the glassy blot\nthat was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things\nas eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked\nthe white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the\nInstitute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially\nacross the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and\nthe ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room.\nAnd in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'\nFoundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr.\n  \n \n  It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America\nof juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America\nof the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the\noff-the-bosom dress and the New Blue Laws. America of the Endless War\nand the loyalty detector. America of marvelous Maizie and the monthly\nrocket to Mars. America of the Thinkers and (a few remembered) the\nInstitute. \"Knock on titanium,\" \"Whadya do for black-outs,\" \"Please,\nlover, don't think when I'm around,\" America, as combat-shocked and\ncrippled as the rest of the bomb-shattered planet.\n  \n \n  Not one impudent photon of the sunlight penetrated the triple-paned,\npolarizing windows of Jorj Helmuth's bedroom in the Thinker's\nFoundation, yet the clock in his brain awakened him to the minute,\nor almost. Switching off the Educational Sandman in the midst of the\nphrase, \"... applying tensor calculus to the nucleus,\" he took a\ndeep, even breath and cast his mind to the limits of the world and\nhis knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with\nimpartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning.\n  \n \n  Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory\nchains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep.\nThese chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which\nrotated the polarizing window panes until the room slowly filled with a\nmuted daylight. Then, still flat on his back, he turned his head until\nhe could look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him.\n  \n<doc-sep>Jorj turned, smiling. \"And now, gentlemen, while we wait for Maizie\nto celebrate, there should be just enough time for us to watch the\ntakeoff of the Mars rocket.\" He switched on a giant television screen.\nThe others made a quarter turn, and there before them glowed the rich\nochres and blues of a New Mexico sunrise and, in the middle distance, a\nsilvery mighty spindle.\n  \n \n  Like the generals, the Secretary of Space suppressed a scowl. Here\nwas something that ought to be spang in the center of his official\nterritory, and the Thinkers had locked him completely out of it. That\nrocket there\u2014just an ordinary Earth satellite vehicle commandeered\nfrom the Army, but equipped by the Thinkers with Maizie-designed\nnuclear motors capable of the Mars journey and more. The first\nspaceship\u2014and the Secretary of Space was not in on it!\n  \n \n  Still, he told himself, Maizie had decreed it that way. And when\nhe remembered what the Thinkers had done for him in rescuing him\nfrom breakdown with their mental science, in rescuing the whole\nAdministration from collapse he realized he had to be satisfied. And\nthat was without taking into consideration the amazing additional\nmental discoveries that the Thinkers were bringing down from Mars.\n  \n \n  \"Lord,\" the President said to Jorj as if voicing the Secretary's\nfeeling, \"I wish you people could bring a couple of those wise little\ndevils back with you this trip. Be a good thing for the country.\"\n  \n \n  Jorj looked at him a bit coldly. \"It's quite unthinkable,\" he said.\n\"The telepathic abilities of the Martians make them extremely\nsensitive. The conflicts of ordinary Earth minds would impinge on them\npsychotically, even fatally. As you know, the Thinkers were able to\ncontact them only because of our degree of learned mental poise and\nerrorless memory-chains. So for the present it must be our task alone\nto glean from the Martians their astounding mental skills. Of course,\nsome day in the future, when we have discovered how to armor the minds\nof the Martians\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, I know,\" the President said hastily. \"Shouldn't have mentioned\nit, Jorj.\"\n  \n \n  Conversation ceased. They waited with growing tension for the great\nviolet flames to bloom from the base of the silvery shaft.\n  \n"

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court.

If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

        " \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Ten minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\n  \n \n  For obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\n  \n \n  They can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\n   \n   average\n   \n  velocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\n  \n \n  I got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\n  \n \n  Testing spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\n   \n   DANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n   \n  ; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n  \n \n  Every schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\n  \n \n  And every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\n  \n \n  The Political Survey Division\n   \n   does\n   \n  evaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\n  \n \n  The PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\n  \n \n  McGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\n   \n   was\n   \n  the spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\n  \n \n  Unforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\n  \n \n  But with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\n   \n   fast\n   \n  ! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\n  \n \n  That meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\n  \n \n  And that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n   MASTER\n    \n   of Life and Death\n   \n \n \n  by\n   \n  ROBERT SILVERBERG\n  \n \n  ACE BOOKS\n   \n  A Division of A.

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you.

He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n"

And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n  \n"

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>For more than a century, robotocists have been trying to build Asimov's\nfamous Three Laws of Robotics into a robot brain.\n  \n \n \n   First Law: A robot shall not, either through action or inaction, allow\nharm to come to a human being.\n   \n \n \n \n   Second Law: A robot shall obey the orders of a human being, except\nwhen such orders conflict with the First Law\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  [15]\n  \n \n \n   Third Law: A robot shall strive to protect its own existence, except\nwhen this conflicts with the First or Second Law.\n   \n \n \n  Nobody has succeeded yet, because nobody has yet succeeded in defining\nthe term \"human being\" in such a way that the logical mind of a robot\ncan encompass the concept.\n  \n \n  A traffic robot is useful only because the definition has been rigidly\nnarrowed down. As far as a traffic robot is concerned, \"human beings\"\nare the automobiles on its highways. Woe betide any poor sap who tries,\nillegally, to cross a robot-controlled highway on foot. The robot's\nonly concern would be with the safety of the automobiles, and if the\nonly way to avoid destruction of an automobile were to be by nudging\nthe pedestrian aside with a fender, that's what would happen.\n  \n \n  And, since its orders only come from one place, I suppose that a\ntraffic robot thinks that the guy who uses that typer is an automobile.\n  \n \n  With the first six models of the McGuire ships, the robotocists\nattempted to build in the Three Laws exactly as stated. And the first\nsix went insane.\n  \n \n  If one human being says \"jump left,\" and another says \"jump right,\"\nthe robot is unable to evaluate which human being has given the more\nvalid order. Feed enough confusing and conflicting data into a robot\nbrain, and it can begin behaving in ways that, in a human being, would\nbe called paranoia or schizophrenia or catatonia or what-have-you,\ndepending\n  [16]\n  on the symptoms. And an insane robot is fully as dangerous\nas an insane human being controlling the same mechanical equipment, if\nnot more so.\n  \n \n  So the seventh model had been modified. The present McGuire's brain was\nimpressed with slight modifications of the First and Second Laws.\n  \n \n  If it is difficult to define a human being, it is much more difficult\nto define a\n   \n   responsible\n   \n  human being. One, in other words, who can\nbe relied upon to give wise and proper orders to a robot, who can be\nrelied upon not to drive the robot insane.\n  \n \n  The robotocists at Viking Spacecraft had decided to take another\ntack. \"Very well,\" they'd said, \"if we can't define all the members\nof a group, we can certainly define an individual. We'll pick one\nresponsible person and build McGuire so that he will take orders only\nfrom that person.\"\n  \n \n  As it turned out, I was that person. Just substitute \"Daniel Oak\"\nfor \"human being\" in the First and Second Laws, and you'll see how\nimportant I was to a certain spaceship named McGuire.\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon. And he was prepared as no man had ever prepared himself\n   \n  before....\n  \n \n \n  DESIRE NO MORE\n  \n \n  by Algis Budrys\n  \n \n  (\n   \n   illustrated by Milton Luros\n   \n  )\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Desire no more than to thy lot may fall....\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \u2014Chaucer\n  \n \n \n"

        "\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh.

His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n  \n \n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n  \n \n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n  \n \n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n  \n \n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n  \n \n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n  \n \n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first he tried to push himself erect, his head whirling with sick\ndizziness, and bewilderment. Through a twisting haze, he peered up at\nthe girl's face. It reflected a look that, amazingly, was one of\u2014with\nno other phrase to do\u2014compassion. Star half-sighed, and laid his head\non the girl's breast, and closed his eyes.\n  \n \n  In a minute or two, she said tensely, \"Are you all right?\" Star looked\nup at her.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so. Here\u2014give a hand while I get my balance.\" She held him as\nhe tried a step or two, and then he straightened. \"I guess I'll be all\nright, now,\" he smiled. \"My head feels like\u2014say! How come you're doing\nthis? What made you change your mind? And who are you?\"\n  \n \n  She said quickly, breathlessly, \"I know you're Star Blade, now. That\ntransmission set.... I can read lips! I\n   \n   knew\n   \n  what that officer was\nsaying! It was just as if I had\n   \n   heard\n   \n  him say that ... that you were\nStarrett Blade and that man out there is Devil Garrett!\" she made a\nchoking sound. \"And I've been here, alone, for a month! For a month!\"\n  \n \n  \"A month? Huh\u2014please\u2014you...?\"\n  \n \n  Star took a breath, and started over. \"You.... Who\n   \n   are\n   \n  you? What are\nyou doing here?\"\n  \n \n  She said, \"I'm Anne Hinton. My father is Old John Hinton. Have you\nheard of him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course!\" said Star. \"He manufactures most of the equipment '\n   \n   Blade\nCosmian\n   \n  ' uses. Weapons, Hineson Sub-Spacers, Star-Traveler craft ...\nthe ship I was in when Garrett brought me down was a Hinton craft. I\nshould have recognized the name. But go on. What\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Garrett communicated with dad, secretly. He posed as Starrett\nBlade, as you, and told dad that he was developing certain new power\nprocesses. And he is! He has a new\u2014or maybe it isn't so new\u2014way of\nelectrolyzing water to liberate hydrogen and oxygen.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I understand,\" said Star quickly. \"When the oxygen and\nhydrogen are allowed to combine, and produce an explosion which drive\na turbine-generator. Then that could be hitched up to a cyclotron, and\neven the most barren of Alpha's lake-rock planets could be....\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she shook her head puzzledly. \"It's just electric power. He said\nthat atomics would release stray rays that would attract pirates.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Star nodded, abstractedly. \"I was thinking of another\napplication of it ... hmm. But say! What was Garrett after? I know that\nhe wouldn't do this just to get a secret process sold. He must have had\nanother plan behind it. Got any idea?\"\n  \n \n  Anne shook her head slowly. \"I don't know. I can't see....\"\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps I could help you?\" Devil Garrett asked smoothly from the door.\n  \n \n  Star whirled, thrust Anne behind him, but there was no way out. Garrett\nstood in the door, and there were men behind him. The jet in his hand\ncould kill both of the two at one shot. And they had no weapons to\nresist with.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped them out of the room, and down the corridor,\nthrough a large door Star had noticed at the end of the passage, and\ninto a huge room.\n  \n \n  It must have been a thousand feet long, and half that wide. It was at\nleast a hundred yards deep. And it was almost filled with gigantic\nmachines.\n  \n \n  Between the machinery, the spaces were almost filled with steel ladders\nand cat-walks. Crews of men swarmed over them. It was the largest mass\nof equipment Starrett had ever seen.\n  \n \n  His eyes began to pick out details. Those huge vat-like things down\nat the far end, with the large cables running into them, and the\nmighty pumps connected to them ... they were probably the electrolysis\nchambers.\n  \n \n  And those great pipes, they must carry the hydrogen and oxygen from\nthe electro chambers to the large replicas of engines, which could be\nnothing else but the explosion chambers, where the gases were allowed\nto re-unite, and explode. And there by the giant engines, those must be\nturbines, which in turn connected with the vast-sized generators just\nunder the platforms on which they stood.\n  \n"

A huge enterprise! It\ncould be ... but for a moment he had forgotten Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  The girl standing by his side, Star turned toward Garrett. \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  Garrett smiled his mocking grin. \"You grasp the principle, of course.\nBut let me show you ... you see those pipes that run from the turbines\nafter the wheels?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. They carry the gases off. Where do they lead?\"\n  \n \n  \"Into giant subterranean caverns beneath the surface!\" Garrett said.\n\"Now look over there, on the platforms across from us. Can you\nrecognize a Barden energy-beamer, Blade? Run by power from my little\nplant here, which is run by water from a thousand lakes!\n  \n \n  \"Just imagine, if you can, hundreds of those plants all over Alpha\nIII. And each one with dozens of high-powered Barden beams to protect\nit! And Hinton ray screens to protect us from radio-controlled rocket\nshells from space, or Barden Rays, or any other weapon of offence, or\nto warn if anyone lands on this planet!\" Garrett leaned forward, his\neyes aglow.\n  \n \n  \"Blade, I'll take over the few governing posts on this little planet,\nand I'll rule an entire world, a whole planet to myself! It'll be the\nfirst time in history! And it won't be the last. With the Hinton secret\npatents, the plans of all John Hinton's inventions and processes....\"\n  \n \n  Star twisted, and got his \"ace card\" out of its hiding place.\n  \n \n  It was a jet weapon, little more than a jet-blast capsule for a\njet-gun. The sides were thicker and stronger, and there was a device\nfixed on it so it could be fired. Altogether, it was somewhat smaller\nthan an old-style fountain pen.\n  \n \n  He twisted up from the floor, and moved faster than he had moved ever\nbefore. Star was famous for his speed and the quickness and alertness\nof his reflexes. He earned his fame a score of times over in that one\ninstant.\n  \n \n \n \n  And Devil Garrett died.\n  \n \n  There was perhaps an eighth of a second between the staff of blue white\nfire from the tiny jet in Star's hand and the huge broadsword of fire\nfrom Garrett's gun. But in the split-second Star's fire knifed into\nGarrett's vitals, and Garrett gave a convulsive jerk, and fired even as\nhis muscles started the jerking movement.\n  \n \n  And the flame went over Star's head, singeing his scalp.\n  \n \n  Of the four men with Garrett, one let go of the struggling Anne, and\nswore as he snatched at an electron knife in his belt. Anne's hand\nhad already whipped the knife out, and without bothering to press the\nelectron stud, she buried the knife in his back.\n  \n \n  Two of the remaining men whirled, and went for the door as though a\ndevil was after them. The other tried to get a jet-gun out. It was his\nfinal mistake. A blue lance from Anne's knife whipped close enough to\nhim to make him dodge, and then Star got his hand on Garrett's jet.\n  \n \n  The other two men had, in their flight, taken a door which led, not\ninto the large corridor, but into a small room at one side, a room\nfilled with instruments and recording devices for the machinery in the\nroom below. Star leaped to the side of the door, and called, \"Are you\ngoing to come out, or am I coming in to get you?\"\n  \n \n  There was a short silence, in which Anne heard one say hoarsely, \"He\ncan't get us ... we could get him if he came in the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes?\" was the answer. \"Do you know who that guy is? He's the one\nthey call 'Death Star.' I'm not facing Starrett Blade in a gun fight.\nYou can do what you like, but I'm leaving.\" Then he lifted his voice.\n\"Hey, Blade! I'm coming out. Don't shoot.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n  \n \n  \"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\n  \n \n  After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n  \n \n"

    [
        "\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done.

Shluh\nretracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her\nmouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How did they die?\" Retief snapped. \"Did you murder them, cut their\nthroats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure\nout for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them\nyell....\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Fith gasped. \"I must correct this terrible false impression at\nonce.\"\n  \n \n  \"False impression, hell,\" Retief said. \"They were Terrans! A simple\nnarco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the\nparade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Fith said weakly. \"It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there\nwas no killing.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're alive?\"\n  \n \n  \"Alas, no.

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n"

Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n  \n<doc-sep>Star Blade stood before a transmitter, and thought about death.\n  \n \n  He was very close to it. Garrett stood five yards away, a gun in\nhis hand, and the muzzle trained on Blade's chest. The gun was the\nuniversally used weapon of execution, an old projectile-firing weapon.\n  \n \n  Star did not doubt that Devil Garrett was an excellent shot with it.\n  \n \n  The girl, very round-eyed and nervous, sat by Garrett. He had explained\nto her that Garrett was the type of pirate that it is law to kill, or\nhave executed, by anyone. Which was very true.\n  \n \n  A man stepped away from the transmitter, and nodded to Garrett. Star\nfelt a surge of hope, as he saw that it was a two-way transmitter. If\nthe image of an Interstellar Command headquarters was tuned in\u2014Garrett\nwould undoubtedly do it, if only to show the police that he had killed\nStarrett Blade\u2014then Garrett could not kill him and cut the beam in\ntime to prevent one of the police from giving a cry that would echo\nover the sub-space beam arriving almost instantly in this room, and let\nthe girl know that she had been tricked. And Garrett would not want\nthat. Not that it would matter to Starrett Blade.\n  \n \n  Then Star saw what kind of a transmitter it was, and he groaned. It\nwas not a Hineson Sub-space beamer ... it was an old-style transmitter\nwhich had different wave speeds, because of the different space-bridger\nunits in it.\n  \n \n  The visual image would arrive many seconds before the sound did. Thus\nthe girl would not hear Garrett revealed, but would see only Blade's\ndeath. And then ... whatever Garrett had planned, Blade wished heartily\nthat he could have the chance to interfere.\n  \n \n  The beam was coming in. Star saw the mists swimming on the screen\nchange, solidify into a figure ... the figure of District Commander\nWeddel seated at a desk. He saw Weddel's eyebrows rise, saw his lips\nmove\u2014then Garrett stepped over a pace, and Weddel saw him, saw the gun\nin his hand....\n  \n \n  The police officer yelled, silently, and came to his feet, an\nexpression of shocked surprise on his face\u2014surprise, Blade thought\ndesperately, that the girl might interpret as shock at seeing Devil\nGarrett.\n  \n \n  Which was right, in a way.\n  \n \n  Then, as Commander Weddel leapt to his feet, as Devil Garrett's\nfinger tightened on the trigger, as the girl sucked in her breath\ninvoluntarily, Star Blade scooped up a bit of metal\u2014a fork\u2014and flung\nit at the vision transmitter.\n  \n \n  Not at the screen. But at the equipment behind the dial-board. At a\ncertain small unit, which was almost covered by wires and braces for\nthe large tubes. And the fork struck it, bit deep, and caused result.\n  \n \n  Result in the form of a burned-out set. If television equipment can\ncurse, that set cursed them. Its spitting of sparks and blue electric\nflame mingled with a strange, high-pitched whine.\n  \n \n  It was the diversion that caused Garrett to miss Star, which gave him\ntime to pull three or four of Garrett's men onto the floor with him.\nOne of the men drove the butt of a jet-gun into the side of Star's\nhead, and for the third time, he went very limp. The last thing he saw\nwas the girl.\n  \n \n  Somehow, the expression on her face was different from what it had\nbeen. He was searching for the difference, when the blow struck\nhim. Somewhere in the space that lies between consciousness and\nunconsciousness, he reflected bitterly that if he kept staring at the\ngirl when he should be fighting, he might not recover some day. This\nwas the third time that he had been knocked out that way. It was not\ngetting monotonous. He still felt it a novelty.\n  \n \n  Star awoke in the same prison cell, facing the wall away from the door.\nHe wondered if he were still alive, tried to move his head, and decided\nthat he wasn't. He didn't even get up or look around when he dimly\nheard the door being opened.\n  \n \n  But when he heard the girl's voice, he came up and around very swiftly,\ndespite his head.\n  \n \n  It was the girl all right. Even through the tumbled mists of his brain,\nhe could see that she was not a dream. And as he reeled and fell\nagainst the wall, she was beside him in a flash, her arm supporting him.\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned back to the window. \"And all because a pirate named Devil\nGarrett built a vast power plant to use to garner more power!\"\n  \n \n  \"You know, Anne, as a mockery, and a warning, I think I'll propose that\nthis planet be officially named ... 'Garrett'!\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him, and there was laughter bright in her eyes, and\ntugging at her mouth. \"Yes, there ought to be a reason,\" she murmured.\nStar wavered. She was so darn close.\n  \n \n  After a minute, she turned her head, and looked up at him. \"Star, how\nsoon will there be those gardens and woods you described? I mean,\nhow long before Garrett can be turned into that kind of world you\ndescribed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why ... under pressure, we can do it in six months. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not half quick enough,\" she murmured happily, \"but it'll have to do,\nStar.\" Laughing, she turned her face up to his. \"Have you ever thought\nthat planet Garrett will be wonderful for a honeymoon?\"\n  \n \n"

        "He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\n  \n \n  Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\n   \n   pirate\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\n  \n \n  The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\n  \n \n  Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\n  \n \n  Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\n  \n \n  An eternity seemed to pass.\n  \n \n  Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\n  \n \n  Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\n  \n \n  The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\n  \n \n  He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\n  \n \n  Star's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\n  \n \n  Star stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\n  \n \n  Star said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n  \n \n  \"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\n  \n \n  Fire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.\n  \n<doc-sep>When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n  \n \n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n  \n \n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n  \n \n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n  \n \n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n  \n \n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n  \n \n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n"

        " \n  The Snare\n  \n \n  By RICHARD R. SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEISS\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\n   \n  on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   It's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\n   \n \n \n \n  I glanced at the path we had made across the\n   \n   Mare Serenitatis\n   \n  . The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n  \n \n  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n  \n \n  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n  \n \n  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n  \n \n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n   \n   Moss\nRock\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n  \n \n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n  \n \n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n  \n \n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"This is it,\" Chip said softly. \"You want me to keep an eye on who\ncomes down the passage?\"\n  \n \n  Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin. The captain\nlooked up from his desk, then jumped up.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're doing, busting in here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear you're planning a course change, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've got damn big ears.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think we'd better call in at Jorgensen's.\"\n  \n \n  \"You do, huh?\" the captain sat down. \"I'm in command of this vessel,\"\nhe said. \"I'm changing course for Alabaster.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't find it convenient to go to Alabaster,\" Retief said. \"So\njust hold your course for Jorgensen's.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not bloody likely.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your use of the word 'bloody' is interesting, Captain. Don't try to\nchange course.\"\n  \n \n  The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.\n  \n \n  \"Power Section, this is the captain,\" he said. Retief reached across\nthe desk, gripped the captain's wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Tell the mate to hold his present course,\" he said softly.\n  \n \n  \"Let go my hand, buster,\" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief's, he\neased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the\ndrawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.\n  \n \n  \"You busted it, you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And one to go,\" Retief said. \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm an officer of the Merchant Service!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a cheapjack who's sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley\nhoods.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't put it over, hick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell him.\"\n  \n \n  The captain groaned and picked up the mike. \"Captain to Power Section,\"\nhe said. \"Hold your present course until you hear from me.\" He dropped\nthe mike and looked up at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"It's eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going\nto sit here and bend my arm the whole time?\"\n  \n \n  Retief released the captain's wrist and turned to the door.\n  \n \n  \"Chip, I'm locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what's\ngoing on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I'm sitting up with\na sick friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he's slippery.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are you going to do?\" the captain demanded.\n  \n \n  Retief settled himself in a chair.\n  \n \n  \"Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,\" he said, \"I'm going to\nstay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen's Worlds.\"\n  \n \n  The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel\nlike dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don't mind me.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him.\n  \n \n  \"If anything happens that I don't like,\" he said, \"I'll wake you up.\nWith this.\"\n  \n"

        " \n  The Snare\n  \n \n  By RICHARD R. SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEISS\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\n   \n  on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   It's easy to find a solution when there is one\u2014the trick is to do it\nif there is none!\n   \n \n \n \n  I glanced at the path we had made across the\n   \n   Mare Serenitatis\n   \n  . The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n  \n \n  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n  \n \n  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n  \n \n  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n  \n \n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. \"I'd say we've\ndone everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a\nthorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally,\nis in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions\nare being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the\nevening\u2014which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance.\"\n  \n \n  One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table.\nCeleste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that\nhad engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms.\n  \n \n  \"I'll take over Ivan's notes,\" she heard Edmund say. \"They're mainly\nabout the Deep Shaft.\"\n  \n \n  \"How far have they got with that?\" Frieda asked idly. \"Twenty-five\nmiles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nearer thirty, I believe,\" Edmund answered, \"and still going down.\"\n  \n \n  At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes\nwent toward Ivan's briefcase.\n  \n<doc-sep>The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me\u2014in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n   \n   Moss\nRock\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it\u2014a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy\u2014fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian\u2014\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks?

We were locked in an alien ship at\nthe start of a six months' journey to a strange planet. We had no tools\nor weapons.\n  \n \n  Solution? I doubted if two dozen geniuses working steadily for years\ncould think of one!\n  \n \n  I wondered what the alien race was like. Intelligent, surely: They had\nforeseen our conquest of space flight when we hadn't even invented\nthe wheel. That thought awed me\u2014somehow they had analyzed our brains\nthousands of years ago and calculated what our future accomplishments\nwould be.\n  \n \n  They had been able to predict our scientific development, but they\nhadn't been able to tell how our civilization would develop. They were\ncurious, so they had left an enormously elaborate piece of bait on the\nMoon.\n  \n \n  The aliens were incredibly more advanced than ourselves. I couldn't\nhelp thinking,\n   \n   And to a rabbit in a snare, mankind must seem\nimpossibly clever\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  I decided to ask the machine about its makers in the \"morning.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Six rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\n  \n \n  The rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\n  \n \n  After intensive searching, we realized there was\n   \n   no way\n   \n  to damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\n  \n \n  We gave up.\n  \n \n  The women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  At random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n  \n \n  \"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n  \n \n  \"You sure?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Does\n   \n  every problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\n  \n \n  My resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\n  \n"

I had to\nprevent the fifth from entering the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on,\" Kane ordered. \"We'll search this ship room by room and we'll\nfind some way to make it take us back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's useless,\" the ship warned us.\n  \n \n  For five hours, we minutely examined every room. We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n"

        "I took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\n  \n \n  We had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\n  \n \n  Verana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\n  \n \n  Six doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\n  \n \n  This time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\n  \n \n  I entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\n  \n \n  The walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n  \n \n  \"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\n  \n \n  The drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\n  \n \n  I selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\n  \n \n  The only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\n  \n \n  I tasted a small piece.\n  \n \n  \"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\n  \n \n  Verana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n  \n \n  \"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\n  \n<doc-sep>When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\n  \n \n  I was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\n  \n \n  Kane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n  \n \n  \"Awake, huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n  \n \n  \"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your plan?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\n  \n \n  I grunted my disgust.\n  \n \n  \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n  \n \n  \"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Right.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n  \n \n  \"What remark?\"\n  \n \n  \"It said, '\n   \n   My\n   \n  masters will be displeased with\n   \n   me\n   \n  if you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>I assumed a baffled expression. I didn't have the slightest idea of\nwhat he was driving at and I told him so.\n  \n \n  \"Ed,\" he said, \"if you could build an electronic brain capable of\nmaking decisions, how would you build it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell, I don't know,\" I confessed.\n  \n \n  \"Well, if I could build an electronic brain like the one running this\nship, I'd build it with a\n   \n   conscience\n   \n  so it'd do its best at all\ntimes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Machines always do their best,\" I argued. \"Come on, untie us. I'm\ngetting a crick in my back!\" I didn't like the idea of being slugged\nwhile asleep. If Kane had been sober and if his wife hadn't been\npresent, I would have let him know exactly what I thought of him.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Our\n   \n  machines always do their best,\" he argued, \"because we punch\nbuttons and they respond in predetermined patterns. But the electronic\nbrain in this ship isn't automatic. It makes decisions and I'll bet it\neven has to decide how much energy and time to put into each process!\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  He shrugged muscular shoulders. \"So this ship is operated by a\nthinking, conscientious machine. It's the first time I've encountered\nsuch a machine, but I think I know what will happen. I spent hours last\nnight figuring\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What are you talking about?\" I interrupted. \"Are you so drunk that you\ndon't know\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll show you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  He walked around the table and stood behind my chair. I felt his thick\nfingers around my throat and smelled the alcohol on his breath.\n  \n \n  \"Can you see me, machine?\" he asked the empty air.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" the electronic brain replied.\n  \n \n  \"Watch!\"\n  \n \n  Kane tightened his fingers around my throat.\n  \n \n  Verana and Marie screamed shrilly.\n  \n \n  My head seemed to swell like a balloon; my throat gurgled painfully.\n  \n \n  \"Please stop,\" the machine pleaded.\n  \n \n  \"What will your masters think of you if I kill all of us? You'll return\nto them with a cargo of dead people!\"\n  \n"

        "\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high.

        "Kaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  be\nexperiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside. If they\nwere, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a\nsuggestion of urgency\u2014there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of\ninformation.\n  \n \n  Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser.\nHe knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time.\nAnd the\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  would not complete its orbit of the planet for\ntwo weeks yet.\n  \n \n  Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used\nto wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the\nvicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went\nback inside.\n  \n \n  Another message came in as he finished eating.

        "The ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   All hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Shano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\n  \n \n  Pressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\n  \n \n  The cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\n  \n \n  Shano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\n  \n \n  Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\n  \n \n  He acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\n  \n \n  He was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\n  \n \n  A bell clanged.\n  \n \n  Shano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\n  \n \n  Shano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\n  \n \n  Shano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\n  \n<doc-sep>The ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\n  \n \n  The ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\n   \n   Emergency. Battle posts.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\n  \n \n  The words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\n  \n \n  This was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\n  \n \n  The deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n  \n \n  \"Fire number seven.\"\n  \n \n  He heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\n  \n \n  This was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\n  \n \n  He wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\n  \n \n  The ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n  \n \n  \"Hold fire.\"\n  \n \n  He crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Stand by.\"\n  \n \n  Shano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\n  \n \n  This box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n  \n \n  \"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\n  \n \n  Shano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Smoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\n  \n \n  He poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\n  \n \n  He straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\n  \n \n  A chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n  \n \n  \"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\n  \n \n  Shano blinked.\n  \n \n  Rourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n \n \n   \"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\n   \n \n \n \n  He lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\n  \n \n  Shano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\n  \n \n  He got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\n  \n<doc-sep>A tremendous grinding sounded amid-ships. Loud rending noises of\nprotesting metal. The ship bucked like a hooked fish. Then it was\nstill. An empty clank echoed through the hull. The captain's voice\ncame, almost yelling. \"Emergency! Emergency! Back to your posts. Engine\nroom\u2014report! Engine room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Shano picked himself off the deck, his mind muddled. He coughed and\nput a cigarette to his lips, flicking a lighter disk jerkily from his\npocket. He blew smoke from his nostrils and heard the renewed pounding\nof feet. What was going on now?\n  \n \n  \"Engine room! Your screen is dead! Switch onto loud-speaker system.\nEngine room!\"\n  \n \n  Giddily, Shano heard clicks and rasps and then a thick voice, atom\nmotors whirring in the background.\n  \n \n  \"Selector's gone, sir. Direct hit. Heat ray through the deck plates.\nWe've sealed the tear. Might repair selector in five hours.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and sent a burst of smoke from his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Captain!\" A rasping, grating sound ensued from a grill above Shano's\nhead, then a disconnected voice. \"Get the men out of there. It's\nuseless. Hurry it up!\" A series of clicks and the heavy voice of the\nchief engineer. \"Captain! Somebody's smashed the selector chamber.\nEngine room's full of toxia gas!\"\n  \n \n  Shano jumped. He prodded the body on the deck with his toe.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Stardust's\n   \n  mechanical voice bellowed: \"Engine room!\" It\nreproduced the captain's heavy breathing and his tired voice. \"We're\nabout midway to Venus,\" it said. \"There were two ships and we drove\nthem off. But there may be others. They'll be coming back. They know\nwe've been hit. We have to get away fast!\"\n  \n \n  Shano could see the captain in his mind, worried, squared face slick\nwith moisture. Shouting into a control room mike. Trying to find out\nwhat the matter was with his space ship.\n  \n \n  The engineer's answer came from the grill. \"Impossible, sir. Engine\nroom full of toxia gas. Not a suit aboard prepared to withstand it. And\nwe have to keep it in there. Selector filaments won't function without\nthe gas. Our only chance was to put a man in the engine room to repair\nthe broken selector valve rods or keep them running by hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Blast it!\" roared the captain. \"No way of getting in there? Can't you\nby-pass the selector?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. It's the heart of the new cosmic drive, sir. The fuels must pass\nthrough selector valves before entering the tube chambers. Filaments\nwill operate so long as toxia gas is there to burn, and will keep\ntrying to open the valves and compensate for fluctuating engine\ntemperature. But the rod pins have melted down, sir\u2014they're common\ntungsten steel\u2014and when the rods pull a valve open, they slip off and\ndrop down, useless. It's a mess. If we could only get a man in there\nhe might lift up the dropped end of a rod and slip it into place each\ntime it fell, and keep the valves working and feeding fuel.\"\n  \n \n  The speaker spluttered and Shano smoked thoughtfully, listening to the\ntalk back and forth, between the captain and the engineer. He didn't\nunderstand it, but knew that everything was ended. They were broken\ndown in space and would never make Earth. Those Uranian devils would\ncome streaking back. Catch them floating, helpless, and blast them to\nbits. And he would never get home to die.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and cursed his lungs. Time was when these gum-clogged\nlungs had saved his life. In the Plutonian mines. Gas explosions in the\ntunnels. Toxia gas, seeping in, burning the men's insides. But with\ngum-clogged lungs he'd been able to work himself clear. Just getting\nsick where other men had died, their insides burned out.\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and thought.\n  \n"

        "The corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval\nchamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with\ntattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed\nspears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power\nrifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles\u2014and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n  \n \n  Lesser trolls\u2014beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed\u2014trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n  \n \n  \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt\u2014the tallest of the\nfeasters\u2014he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word\nwith him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from\nthe other Centers as well.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,\ntonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons.

This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet.

For only a moment I\nstared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented\nit to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I\nwas ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with\nhis eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it\ntoward me.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the\nremaining bag. \"One left over, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But\nhe was eying me with a \"well-why-don't-you-get-along?\" look.\n  \n \n  I said, \"What happens if nobody claims it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Take it inside. Why?\"\n  \n \n  He was getting too curious. \"Oh, I just wondered, that's all.\"\n  \n \n  I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance\nand put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying\nover.\n  \n \n  \"Cab?\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Just waiting.\"\n  \n \n  Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.\n  \n \n  I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage\nclaim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran\nthrough my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied\nme.\n  \n \n  I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a\nman named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing\nsomething very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could\nI do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the\nbag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to\nlive with myself.\n  \n \n  No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until\u2014until\nwhat?\n  \n \n  A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of\nthe entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a\npair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could\ntell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the\nwhole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own\nbusiness.\n  \n \n  But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started\nacross the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,\n\"Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.\" But\nI didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim\ncounter out of the side of my eye.\n  \n \n  The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp\nto the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went\ninside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag\non the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The\nclerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.\n  \n \n  I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How\nmany minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014were left? I was sweating when I moved to the\ncounter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I\nhad to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the\nclock again.\n  \n \n  \"Can I help you?\" the clerk asked.\n  \n \n  \"No. I'm waiting for someone.\"\n  \n \n  I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the\ncounter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the\ndevice, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel\nescaped my grasp.\n  \n \n  \"Do you have my suitcase?\"\n  \n \n  I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood\nthere looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand\nshe had a green baggage claim check.\n  \n \n  The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight\ncase and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,\nglanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.\n  \n \n  \"Just a moment,\" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying\nafter her.\n  \n"

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n"

He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n  \n 11\n  \n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n  \n \n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses.",
        " As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon.\n  \n<doc-sep>  He had but one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to\n   \n  the moon.

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\nman's dream.\n  \n \n  He made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\nkind\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\n  \n \n  Do you know\n   \n   why\n   \n  he wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\n  \n \n  It was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\nbrothers, the planets his children.\n  \n \n  You say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\n   \n   sure\n   \n  until the journey is\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\nstar and think,\n   \n   I might have gone there; I could have been the first\n   \n  ?\n  \n \n  We said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach.

        "III\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n<doc-sep>He'd noticed the dewed silver pitcher, but only now realized his\nthirst. Yet when she handed him a glass, he held it untasted and said\nawkwardly, \"I haven't introduced myself. I'm Jack Barry.\"\n  \n \n  She stared at his outstretched right hand, slowly extended her own\ntoward it, shook it up and down exactly once, then quickly dropped it.\n  \n \n  He chuckled and gulped some lemonade. \"I'm a biology student. Been\nworking at Wood's Hole the first part of the summer. But now I'm here\nto do research in marine ecology\u2014that's sort of sea-life patterns\u2014of\nthe in-shore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesserich. You\nknow about him, of course?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the greatest living biologist,\" he was proud to inform\nher. \"Human physiology as well. Tremendous geneticist. In a class\nwith Carlson and Jacques Loeb. Martin Kesserich\u2014he lives over there\nat town. I'm staying with him. You ought to have heard of him.\" He\ngrinned. \"Matter of fact, I'd never have met you if it hadn't been for\nMrs. Kesserich.\"\n  \n \n  The girl looked puzzled.\n  \n \n  Jack explained, \"The old boy's been off to Europe on some conferences,\nwon't be back for a couple days more. But I was to get started anyhow.\nWhen I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich\u2014she's a drab sort of\nperson\u2014said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of\ncourse, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as\nif she were saying it for the first time.\n  \n \n  \"You're pretty shy, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  The question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this\nstrangely attractive girl dressed almost like a \"flapper.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you sit down?\" she asked him gravely.\n  \n \n  The rattan chair sighed under his weight. He made another effort to\ntalk. \"I'll bet you'll be glad when summer's over.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"So you'll be able to go back to the mainland.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I never go to the mainland.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you stay out here all winter?\" he asked incredulously, his\nmind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray and great gray waves.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are\nvery capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that's impossible!\" he said with sudden sympathetic anger. \"You\ncan't be shut off this way from people your own age!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the first one I ever met.\" She hesitated. \"I never saw a boy or\na man before, except in movies.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're joking!\"\n  \n \n  \"No, it's true.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why are they doing it to you?\" he demanded, leaning forward. \"Why\nare they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A grim tale of a future in which everyone is desperate to escape\nreality, and a hero who wants to have his wine and drink it, too.\n   \n \n \n  A BOTTLE OF\n   \n \n   Old Wine\n   \n \n \n  By Richard O.

        "The Movement met in what had been the children's room, where unpaid\nladies of the afternoon had once upon a time read stories to other\npeople's offspring.

He\nstood in the center of the room, leaning on a heavy knobbed cane.

But what was the\nlight? And what were these other things in the room?\n  \n \n  Wherever he looked, the light danced along with his eyes. It was like\nhaving tunnel vision or wearing blinders. He could see what he was\nlooking at, but he could see nothing else. And the things he could\nsee made no sense. A spacesuit, yes; he knew that he could construct\na logical explanation for that with no trouble\u2014maybe a subspace\nmeteorite striking the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  , an explosion, himself knocked\nout, brought here in a suit ... well, it was an explanation with more\nholes than fabric, like a fisherman's net, but at least it was rational.\n  \n \n  How to explain a set of Gibbon's\n   \n   Decline and Fall of the Roman\nEmpire?\n   \n  A space-ax? Or the old-fashioned child's rocking-chair, the\nchemistry set\u2014or, most of all, the scrap of gaily printed fabric\nthat, when he picked it up, turned out to be a girl's scanty bathing\nsuit? It was slightly reassuring, McCray thought, to find that most of\nthe objects were more or less familiar. Even the child's chair\u2014why,\nhe'd had one more or less like that himself, long before he was old\nenough to go to school. But what were they doing here?\n  \n \n  Not everything he saw was familiar. The walls of the room itself were\nstrange. They were not metal or plaster or knotty pine; they were\nnot papered, painted or overlaid with stucco. They seemed to be made\nof some sort of hard organic compound, perhaps a sort of plastic or\nprocessed cellulose. It was hard to tell colors in the pinkish light.\nBut they seemed to have none. They were \"neutral\"\u2014the color of aged\ndriftwood or unbleached cloth.\n  \n \n  Three of the walls were that way, and the floor and ceiling. The fourth\nwall was something else. Areas in it had the appearance of gratings;\nfrom them issued the pungent, distasteful halogen odor. They might be\nventilators, he thought; but if so the air they brought in was worse\nthan what he already had.\n  \n \n  McCray was beginning to feel more confident. It was astonishing how a\nlittle light made an impossible situation bearable, how quickly his\ncourage flowed back when he could see again.\n  \n \n  He stood still, thinking. Item, a short time ago\u2014subjectively it\nseemed to be minutes\u2014he had been aboard the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  with\nnothing more on his mind than completing his check-sighting and meeting\none of the female passengers for coffee. Item, apart from being\nshaken up and\u2014he admitted it\u2014scared damn near witless, he did not\nseem to be hurt. Item, wherever he was now, it became, not so much what\nhad happened to him, but what had happened to the ship?\n  \n \n  He allowed that thought to seep into his mind. Suppose there had been\nan accident to the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He could, of course, be dead. All this could be the fantasies of a\ncooling brain.\n  \n \n  McCray grinned into the pink-lit darkness. The thought had somehow\nrefreshed him, like icewater between rounds, and with a clearing head\nhe remembered what a spacesuit was good for.\n  \n \n  It held a radio.\n  \n \n  He pressed the unsealing tabs, slipped his hand into the vacant chest\nof the suit and pulled out the hand mike. \"This is Herrell McCray,\" he\nsaid, \"calling the\n   \n   Jodrell Bank\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  No response. He frowned. \"This is Herrell McCray, calling\n   \n   Jodrell\nBank\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Herrell McCray, calling anybody, come in, please.\"\n  \n \n  But there was no answer.\n  \n \n  Thoughtfully he replaced the microphone. This was ultrawave radio,\nsomething more than a million times faster than light, with a range\nmeasured, at least, in hundreds of light-years. If there was no answer,\nhe was a good long way from anywhere.\n  \n \n  Of course, the thing might not be operating.\n  \n \n  He reached for the microphone again\u2014\n  \n \n  He cried aloud.\n  \n \n  The pinkish lights went out. He was in the dark again, worse dark than\nbefore.\n  \n \n  For before the light had gone, McCray had seen what had escaped\nhis eyes before. The suit and the microphone were clear enough in\nthe pinkish glimmer; but the hand\u2014his own hand, cupped to hold the\nmicrophone\u2014he had not seen at all. Nor his arm. Nor, in one fleeting\nmoment of study, his chest.\n  \n \n  McCray could not see any part of his own body at all.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Someone else could.\n  \n \n  Someone was watching Herrell McCray, with the clinical fascination\nof a biochemist observing the wigglings of paramecia in a new\nantibiotic\u2014and with the prayerful emotions of a starving, shipwrecked,\nsailor, watching the inward bobbing drift of a wave-born cask that\n   \n   may\n   \n  contain food.\n  \n \n  Suppose you call him \"Hatcher\" (and suppose you call it a \"him.\")\nHatcher was not exactly male, because his race had no true males; but\nit did have females and he was certainly not that. Hatcher did not in\nany way look like a human being, but they had features in common.\n  \n \n  If Hatcher and McCray had somehow managed to strike up an acquaintance,\nthey might have got along very well. Hatcher, like McCray, was an\nadventurous soul, young, able, well-learned in the technical sciences\nof his culture. Both enjoyed games\u2014McCray baseball, poker and\nthree-dimensional chess; Hatcher a number of sports which defy human\ndescription. Both held positions of some importance\u2014considering their\nages\u2014in the affairs of their respective worlds.\n  \n \n  Physically they were nothing alike. Hatcher was a three-foot,\nhard-shelled sphere of jelly. He had \"arms\" and \"legs,\" but they were\nnot organically attached to \"himself.\" They were snakelike things which\nobeyed the orders of his brain as well as your mind can make your toes\ncurl; but they did not touch him directly. Indeed, they worked as well\na yard or a quarter-mile away as they did when, rarely, they rested\nin the crevices they had been formed from in his \"skin.\" At greater\ndistances they worked less well, for reasons irrelevant to the Law of\nInverse Squares.\n  \n \n  Hatcher's principal task at this moment was to run the \"probe team\"\nwhich had McCray under observation, and he was more than a little\nexcited. His members, disposed about the room where he had sent them on\nvarious errands, quivered and shook a little; yet they were the calmest\nlimbs in the room; the members of the other team workers were in a\nstate of violent commotion.\n  \n \n  The probe team had had a shock.\n  \n \n  \"Paranormal powers,\" muttered Hatcher's second in command, and the\nothers mumbled agreement. Hatcher ordered silence, studying the\nspecimen from Earth.\n  \n \n  After a long moment he turned his senses from the Earthman.\n\"Incredible\u2014but it's true enough,\" he said. \"I'd better report. Watch\nhim,\" he added, but that was surely unnecessary. Their job was to\nwatch McCray, and they would do their job; and even more, not one of\nthem could have looked away to save his life from the spectacle of\na creature as odd and, from their point of view, hideously alien as\nHerrell McCray.\n  \n<doc-sep>He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and\nnow, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading\nmachine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"What's in here?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"It's a door, I think,\" said Crifer.\n  \n \n  \"I know, but what's beyond it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Beyond it? Oh, you mean\n   \n   through\n   \n  the door.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Crifer scratched his head, \"I don't think anyone ever opened\nit. It's only a door.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" said Rikud.\n  \n \n  \"You will what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Open it. Open the door and look inside.\"\n  \n \n  A long pause. Then, \"Can you do it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before?\nThere's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014\" Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of\nbreath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently,\nand Crifer said, \"Doors are variable, too, I think.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other\nend of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across,\nRikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.\n  \n \n  He missed the beginning, but then:\n  \n \n \n   \u2014therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this\ndoor. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the\nrigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may\nhave discarded it for something better\u2014who knows? But if you have\nnot, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship\nis a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is\nhuman-sustaining as well. Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not\npermit it\u2014within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and\nto avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be\npermitted through this door\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing\nwords. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting\nthan that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another\nvoice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.\n  \n \n  When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle\nhumming, punctuated by a\n   \n   throb-throb-throb\n   \n  which sounded not unlike\nthe booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't\nblast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's\neyes\u2014he blinked and looked again, but it was still there\u2014cogs and\ngears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because\nthey shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.\n  \n \n  \"Odd,\" Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, \"Now there's a good word, but\nno one quite seems to know its meaning.\"\n  \n \n  Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might\nexist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one\nopened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.\n  \n \n  Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The\nviewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and,\nalthough it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography\nwas different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had\nthought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way\noff in the distance.\n  \n \n  And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his\nhand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new\nviewport. He began to turn the handle.\n  \n \n  Then he trembled.\n  \n \n  What would he do out in the garden?\n  \n \n  He couldn't go alone. He'd die of the strangeness. It was a silly\nthought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud\ncouldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt\ndry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.\n  \n \n  Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back\nthrough the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally\nthrough the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.\n  \n \n  By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did\nnot dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and\nsweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the\ngarden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could\nwalk and then might find himself in the garden.\n  \n \n  It was so big.\n  \n"

        "II\n  \n \n  The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home\u2014a weathered white cube with\nnarrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola\u2014was nothing like its\nlavish interior.\n  \n \n  In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming\nfurniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless\nblack form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack\nthink of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered\nagain how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.\n  \n \n  Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the\nuneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were\nstill those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been\nwatching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.\n  \n \n \n \n  He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named\nMary Alice Pope?\"\n  \n \n  The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some\nbovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall\ncabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,\nopened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and\nhanded him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked\nin his breath with surprise.\n  \n \n  It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same\nflat-bosomed dress\u2014flowered rather than white\u2014no bandeau, same beads.\nSame proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.\n  \n \n  \"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat\nvoice. \"She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident\nin 1933.\"\n  \n \n  The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to\nreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the\ngloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with\nwhat seemed a malicious eagerness.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question\u2014he\nwas much too dazed for that\u2014he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her\nposition on the edge of the sofa.\n  \n \n  \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love\nof Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as\nyou probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he\nfirst came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,\nthere was a cloak of loneliness about him\u2014or rather about the three of\nthem.\n  \n \n  \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud\u2014I\ndon't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a\nservant\u2014and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They\nshowered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't\nrealize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with\nMary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without\nmarrying, he was safe.\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred\nBritish stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point\nvery wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did\neverything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was\nafraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani\nand Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But\u2014and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short\u2014her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n  \n \n  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>III\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called\nindividualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much\nabout the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?\"\n  \n \n  Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.\n  \n \n  \"Not especially, sir,\" he mumbled.\n  \n \n  The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if\nit were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had\nsuddenly posed this question about individuality.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I mean, of course,\" Kesserich pressed. \"The factors that\nmake you you, and me me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Heredity and environment,\" Jack parroted like a freshman.\n  \n \n  Kesserich nodded. \"Suppose\u2014this is just speculation\u2014that we could\ncontrol heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same\nindividual at will.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a shiver go through him. \"To get exactly the same pattern of\nhereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some\nspecial technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the\nmother's traits?\"\n  \n \n  \"But environment would change things,\" Jack objected. \"The duplicate\nwould be bound to develop differently.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.\nEach had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox\nterrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments\nsimilar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the\none who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.\n\"Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I\nwon't have any time for it tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Jack looked at him blankly.\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,\" the biologist\nexplained.\n  \n<doc-sep>With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n  \n \n  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well\u2014not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n  \n \n  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n  \n \n  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n  \n \n  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n  \n \n  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed\u2014to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n  \n \n  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been\nMary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n  \n \n  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n  \n \n  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n  \n \n  The great biologist had come home.\n  \n"

He expected his mind to be busy wondering\nabout Kesserich and his wife\u2014things said and half said last night\u2014but\nfound instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as\nif to a farthest island in a world of people.\n  \n \n  Downstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet\u2014he\nfelt behind it, but the key was gone\u2014he hurried down to the\nwaterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an\nafterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.\n  \n \n  The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  There\nwas eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the\nmast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous\nwith faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.\n  \n \n  After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky\nspine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures\nstruck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.\n  \n \n  This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the\ninnocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd\nbrought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence\nwhen he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.\n  \n \n  He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the\nsame time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.\n  \n \n  The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to\nspeak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never\ncome back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've\nbeen watching for you all morning.\"\n  \n \n  He tossed the newspapers over the fence. \"You don't have to read\nthem now,\" he told her. \"Just look at the datelines and a few of the\nheadlines.\"\n  \n \n  When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She\ntried unsuccessfully to speak.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You've been the victim of a scheme to make\nyou believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's\n1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why it's been done, though I\nthink I know who you really are.\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" the girl faltered, \"my aunts tell me it's 1933.\"\n  \n \n  \"They would.\"\n  \n \n  \"And there are the papers ... the magazines ... the radio.\"\n  \n \n  \"The papers are old ones. The radio's faked\u2014some sort of recording. I\ncould show you if I could get at it.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   These\n   \n  papers might be faked,\" she said, pointing to where she'd let\nthem drop on the ground.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said. \"Only old papers get yellow.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why would they do it to me?\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me to the mainland, Mary. That'll set you straight quicker\nthan anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"I couldn't,\" she said, drawing back. \"He's coming tonight.\"\n  \n \n  \"He?\"\n  \n \n  \"The man who sends me the boxes ... and my life.\"\n  \n \n  Jack shivered. When he spoke, his voice was rough and quick. \"A life\nthat's completely a lie, that's cut you off from the world. Come with\nme, Mary.\"\n  \n"

        "Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n  \n \n  In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n  \n \n  He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n  \n \n  The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n  \n \n  \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n  \n \n  Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n  \n \n  Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n  \n \n  \"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are? Look around.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n  \n \n  \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n  \n \n  Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n  \n \n  Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\n  \n \n  Snader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\n  \n \n  Ann clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n  \n \n  \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n  \n \n  She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n  \n \n  \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n  \n \n  It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n  \n \n  Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n  \n \n  As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n  \n \n  \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\n  \n \n  Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n  \n \n  Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n  \n \n  The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\n  \n \n  She said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\n  \n \n  Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights.

        "He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He\nrolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the\nevening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell\nof bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except\nthat she had discarded the white cloak.\n  \n \n  As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,\ncarrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her\nwith the word, \"Miss!\"\n  \n \n  She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n  \n \n  \"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last\nconsonant.\n  \n \n  \"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\n  \n \n  Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing\nforced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her\nshoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait! You mean you don't know?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\n  \n \n  She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What the devil are you doing here on Venus and here in this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"Growing.\" The blue eyes were unafraid.\n  \n \n  Sombrely, Johnson regarded her. What was she doing here? Was she in\nthe employ of the Venusians? If she was being planted on him, then\nhis purpose here was suspected. He shrugged the thought aside. If his\npurpose here was suspected, there would be no point in planting a woman\non him.\n  \n \n  There would only be the minor matter of slipping a knife into his back.\n  \n \n  In this city, as on all of Venus, humans died easily. No one questioned\nthe motives of the killer.\n  \n \n  \"You look as if you were considering some very grave matter,\" Vee Vee\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Not any longer,\" he laughed.\n  \n \n  \"You have decided them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Every last one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there might be one or two matters undecided somewhere, say out on\nthe periphery of the galaxy. But we will solve them when we get to\nthem.\" He waved vaguely toward the roof and the sky of space hidden\nbehind the clouds that lay over the roof, glanced around as a man eased\nhimself into an empty stool on his left. The man was Caldwell.\n  \n \n  \"Zlock!\" Caldwell said, to the bartender. \"Make it snappy. Gotta have\nzlock. Finest damn drink in the solar system.\" Caldwell's voice was\nthick, his tongue heavy. Johnson's eyes went back to the girl but out\nof the corner of them he watched Caldwell's hand lying on the bar. The\nfingers were beating a quick nervous tattoo on the yellow wood.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen him,\" Caldwell's fingers beat out their tattoo. \"But I\nthink he is, or was, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Um,\" Johnson said, his eyes on Vee Vee. \"How\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that girl was asking for him,\" Caldwell's fingers answered.\n\"Watch that girl!\" Picking up the zlock, he lurched away from the bar.\n  \n \n  \"Your friend is not as drunk as he seems,\" Vee Vee said, watching\nCaldwell.\n  \n \n  \"My friend? Do you mean that drunk? I never saw him\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Lying is one of the deadly sins.\" Her eyes twinkled at him. Under the\nmerriment that danced in them there was ice. Johnson felt cold.\n  \n \n  \"The reservations for ze dreaming, great one?\" The headwaiter was\nbowing and scraping in front of him. \"The great one has decided, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"The dreaming!\" Vee Vee looked suddenly alert. \"Of course. We must see\nthe dreaming. Everyone wants to see the dreaming. We will go, won't we\ndarling?\" She hooked her hand into Johnson's elbow.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Johnson said. The decision was made on the spur of the\nmoment. That there was danger in it, he did not doubt. But there might\nbe something else. And\n   \n   he\n   \n  might be there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh. But very good. Ze great Unger, you will love him!\" The headwaiter\nclutched the gold coins that Johnson extended, bowed himself out of\nsight.\n  \n \n  \"Say, I want to know more\u2014\" Johnson began. His words were drowned in\na blast of trumpets. The band that had been playing went into sudden\nsilence. Waves of perfume began to flow into the place. The perfumes\nwere blended, but one aroma was prominent among them, the sweet,\ncloying, soul-stirring perfume of the Dreamer.\n  \n \n  In the suddenly hushed place little sounds began to appear as Venusians\nand humans began to shift their feet and their bodies in anticipation\nof what was to happen.\n  \n \n  The trumpets flared again.\n  \n \n  On one side of the place, a big door began to swing slowly open. From\nbeyond that slowly opening door came music, soft, muted strains that\nsounded like lutes from heaven.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee, her hand on Johnson's elbow, rose. Johnson stood up with\nher. He got the surprise of his life as her fingers clenched, digging\ninto his muscles. Pain shot through his arm, paralyzing it and almost\nparalyzing him. He knew instantly that she was using the Karmer nerve\nblock paralysis on him. His left hand moved with lightning speed, the\ntips of his fingers striking savagely against her shoulder.\n  \n \n  She gasped, her face whitened as pain shot through her in response to\nthe thrust of his finger tips. Her hand that had been digging into his\nelbow lost its grip, dropped away and hung limp at her side. Grabbing\nit, she began to massage it.\n  \n \n  \"You\u2014you\u2014\" Hot anger and shock were in her voice. \"You're the first\nman I ever knew who could break the Karmer nerve paralysis.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the first woman who ever tried it on me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shall we go watch the dreaming?\" He took the arm that still hung limp\nat her side and tucked it into his elbow.\n  \n \n  \"If you try to use the Karmer grip on me again I'll break your arm,\" he\nsaid. His voice was low but there was a wealth of meaning in it.\n  \n \n  \"I won't do it again,\" the girl said stoutly. \"I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" Johnson said.\n  \n \n  \"The second time we break our victim's neck,\" Vee Vee said.\n  \n \n  \"What a sweet, charming child you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before, I'm not a child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Child vampire,\" Johnson said. \"Let me finish my sentences before you\ninterrupt.\"\n  \n \n  She was silent. A smile, struggling to appear on her face, seemed to\nsay she held no malice. Her fingers tightened on Johnson's arm. He\ntensed, expecting the nerve block grip again. Instead with the tips of\nher fingers she gently patted his arm.\n  \n \n  \"There, there, darling, relax,\" she said. \"I know a better way to get\nyou than by using the Karmer grip.\"\n  \n \n  \"What way?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes sparkled. \"Eve's way,\" she answered.\n  \n \n  \"Um!\" Surprise sounded in his grunt. \"But apples don't grow on Venus.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eve's daughters don't use apples any more, darling. Come along.\"\n  \n \n  Moving toward the open door that led to the Room of the Dreaming,\nJohnson saw that Caldwell had risen and was following them. Caldwell's\nface was writhing in apprehensive agony and he was making warning\nsigns. Johnson ignored them. With Vee Vee's fingers lightly patting his\narm, they moved into the Room of the Dreaming.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a huge, semi-illumined room, with tier on tier of circling ramps\nrising up from an open space at the bottom. There ought to have been\na stage there at the bottom, but there wasn't. Instead there was an\nopen space, a mat, and a head rest. Up at the top of the circling ramps\nthe room was in darkness, a fit hiding place for ghosts or Venusian\nwerewolves. Pillows and a thick rug covered the circling ramps.\n  \n \n  The soul-quickening Perfume of the Dreamer was stronger here. The\nthrobbing of the lutes was louder. It was Venusian music the lutes were\nplaying. Human ears found it inharmonious at first, but as they became\naccustomed to it, they began to detect rhythms and melodies that human\nminds had not known existed. The room was pleasantly cool but it had\nthe feel of dampness. A world that was rarely without pelting rain\nwould have the feel of dampness in its dreaming rooms.\n  \n \n  The music playing strange harmonies in his ears, the perfume sending\ntingling feelings through his nose, Johnson entered the Room of the\nDreamer. He suspected that other forces, unknown to him, were catching\nhold of his senses. He had been in dreaming rooms many times before but\nhe had not grown accustomed to them. He wondered if any human ever\ndid. A touch of chill always came over him as he crossed the threshold.\nIn entering these places, it was as if some unknown nerve center\ninside the human organism was touched by something, some force, some\nradiation, some subtlety, that quite escaped radiation. He felt the\ncoldness now.\n  \n \n  Vee Vee's fingers left off patting his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel it, darling?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please!\" Her voice grew sharp. \"I think Johnny Johnson ought to know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Johnny! How do you know my name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shouldn't I recognize one of Earth's foremost scientists, even if he\nis incognito on Venus?\" Her voice had a teasing quality in it.\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And who besides Johnny Johnson would recognize the Karmer nerve grip\nand be able to break it instantly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"John Michael Johnson, known as Johnny to his friends, Earth's foremost\nexpert in the field of electro-magnetic radiations within the human\nbody!\" Her words were needles of icy fact, each one jabbing deeper and\ndeeper into him.\n  \n \n  \"And how would I make certain you were Johnny Johnson, except by seeing\nif you could break the Karmer nerve grip? If you could break it, then\nthere was no doubt who you were!\" Her words went on and on.\n  \n \n  \"Who are you?\" His words were blasts of sound.\n  \n \n  \"Please, darling, you are making a scene. I am sure this is the last\nthing you really want to do.\"\n  \n \n  He looked quickly around them. The Venusians and humans moving into\nthis room seemed to be paying no attention to him. His gaze came back\nto her.\n  \n \n  Again she patted his arm. \"Relax, darling. Your secrets are safe with\nme.\"\n  \n \n  A gray color came up inside his soul. \"But\u2014but\u2014\" His voice was\nsuddenly weak.\n  \n \n  The fingers on his arm were very gentle. \"No harm will come to you. Am\nI not with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I'm afraid of!\" he snapped at her. If he had had a\nchoice, he might have drawn back. But with circumstances as they\nwere\u2014his life, Caldwell's life, possibly Vee Vee's life hung in the\nbalance. Didn't she know that this was true? And as for Martin\u2014But\nCaldwell had said that she had been asking about Martin. What\nconnection did she have with that frantic human genius he sought here?\n  \n \n  Johnson felt his skin crawl. He moved toward a nest of cushions on\na ramp, found a Venusian was beating him to them, deftly changed to\nanother nest, found it. Vee Vee flowed to the floor on his right, moved\ncushions to make him more comfortable. She moved in an easy sort of way\nthat was all flowing movement. He sat down. Someone bumped him on the\nleft.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to bump into you.\" Caldwell's voice was still\nthick and heavy. He sprawled to the floor on Johnson's left. Under\nthe man's coat, Johnson caught a glimpse of a slight bulge, the zit\ngun hidden there. His left arm pressed against his own coat, feeling\nhis own zit gun. Operating under gas pressure, throwing a charge of\ngas-driven corvel, the zit guns were not only almost noiseless in\noperation but they knocked out a human or a Venusian in a matter of\nseconds.\n  \n \n  True, the person they knocked unconscious would be all right the next\nday. For this reason, many people did not regard the zit guns as\neffective weapons, but Johnson had a fondness for them. The feel of the\nlittle weapon inside his coat sent a surge of comfort through him.\n  \n \n  The music picked up a beat, perfume seemed to flow even more freely\nthrough the air, the lights dimmed almost to darkness, a single bright\nspotlight appeared in the ceiling, casting a circle of brilliant\nillumination on the mat and the headrest at the bottom of the room.

But he had been so impatient to\nleave the Lodge, so impatient to exchange the flowing robes of the\nBrotherhood for the close-fitting breeches and tunic of the outer world\nthat had seemed so glamorous and now proved so itchy.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" he replied courteously, for he knew the first rule of universal\nbehavior, \"I have been a Brother.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now why would a good-looking young fellow like you want to join a\nBrotherhood?\" his shelf companion wanted to know. \"Trouble over a\nfemale?\"\n  \n \n  Michael shook his head, smiling. \"No, I have been a member of the\nAngeleno Brotherhood since I was an infant.

It will grow plump with oh-so-good Mealy Mush from Nunki.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir,\" Michael replied. \"Father said that was one of the few\nblessings that brightened an otherwise benighted life.\"\n  \n \n  Horror contorted his fellow traveller's plump features. \"Be careful,\nyoung man!\" he warned. \"Lucky for you that you are talking to someone\nas broad-minded as I, but others aren't.

There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell\nof bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except\nthat she had discarded the white cloak.\n  \n \n  As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,\ncarrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her\nwith the word, \"Miss!\"\n  \n \n  She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n  \n \n  \"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last\nconsonant.\n  \n \n  \"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\n  \n \n  Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing\nforced about it.

You mean you don't know?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\n  \n \n  She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.\n  \n<doc-sep>Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n  \n \n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname.

All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls.

Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.\"\n  \n \n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n  \n \n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death....

He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n"

No one\n   \n   ever\n   \n  wears yellow!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Michael said humbly.

You\n   \n   know\n   \n  when you buy Plummy Fruitcake from\nVega.\"\n  \n \n  The salesman patted Michael's shoulder. \"You staying a while in\nPortyork?\" Michael nodded. \"Then you'd better stick close to me for a\nwhile until you learn our ways. You can't run around loose by yourself\nuntil you've acquired civilized behavior patterns, or you'll get into\ntrouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you, sir,\" Michael said gratefully. \"It's very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  He twisted himself around\u2014it was boiling hot inside the jet bus\nand his damp clothes were clinging uncomfortably\u2014and struck his\nhead against the bottom of the shelf above. \"Awfully inconvenient\narrangement here,\" he commented. \"Wonder why they don't have seats.\"\n  \n \n  \"Because this arrangement,\" Carpenter said stiffly, \"is the one that\nhas proved suitable for the greatest number of intelligent life-forms.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I see,\" Michael murmured. \"I didn't get a look at the other\npassengers. Are there many extraterrestrials on the bus?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dozens of them. Haven't you heard the Sirians singing?\"\n  \n \n  A low moaning noise had been pervading the bus, but Michael had thought\nit arose from defective jets.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes!\" he agreed. \"And very beautiful it is, too! But so sad.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sirians are always sad,\" the salesman told him. \"Listen.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Carpenter rubbed modestly gloved hands together. \"I have no immediate\nbusiness, so supposing I start showing you the sights. What would you\nlike to see first, Mr. Frey? Or would you prefer a nice, restful movid?\"\n  \n \n  \"Frankly,\" Michael admitted, \"the first thing I'd like to do is get\nmyself something to eat. I didn't have any breakfast and I'm famished.\"\nTwo small creatures standing close to him giggled nervously and\nscuttled off on six legs apiece.\n  \n \n  \"Shh, not so loud! There are females present.\" Carpenter drew the\nyouth to a secluded corner. \"Don't you know that on Theemim it's\nfrightfully vulgar to as much as speak of eating in public?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Michael demanded in too loud a voice. \"What's wrong with\neating in public here on Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Carpenter clapped a hand over the young man's mouth. \"Hush,\" he\ncautioned. \"After all, on Earth there are things we don't do or even\nmention in public, aren't there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, yes. But those are different.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all. Those rules might seem just as ridiculous to a Theemimian.\nBut the Theemimians have accepted our customs just as we have accepted\nthe Theemimians'. How would you like it if a Theemimian violated\none of our tabus in public? You must consider the feelings of the\nTheemimians as equal to your own. Observe the golden rule: 'Do unto\nextraterrestrials as you would be done by.'\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm still hungry,\" Michael persisted, modulating his voice,\nhowever, to a decent whisper. \"Do the proprieties demand that I starve\nto death, or can I get something to eat somewhere?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" the salesman whispered back. \"Portyork provides for all\nbodily needs. Numerous feeding stations are conveniently located\nthroughout the port, and there must be some on the field.\"\n  \n \n  After gazing furtively over his shoulder to see that no females were\nwatching, Carpenter approached a large map of the landing field and\npressed a button. A tiny red light winked demurely for an instant.\n  \n \n  \"That's the nearest one,\" Carpenter explained.\n  \n<doc-sep>A large scarlet pencil jumped merrily across the advideo screen. The\nface on the eraser opened its mouth and sang: \"Our pencils are finest\nfrom point up to rubber, for the lead is from Yed, while the wood comes\nfrom Dschubba.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Is there any way of turning that thing off?\" Michael wanted to know.\n  \n \n  The other man smiled. \"If there were, my boy, do you think anybody\nwould watch it? Furthermore, turning it off would violate the spirit of\nfree enterprise. We wouldn't want that, would we?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no!\" Michael agreed hastily. \"Certainly not.\"\n  \n \n  \"And it might hurt the advertiser's feelings, cause him ego injury.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could I ever have had such a ridiculous idea?\" Michael murmured,\nabashed.\n  \n \n  \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" said his companion. \"My name is\nPierce B. Carpenter. Aphrodisiacs are my line. Here's my card.\" He\nhanded Michael a transparent tab with the photograph of Mr. Carpenter\nsuspended inside, together with his registration number, his name, his\naddress, and the Universal seal of approval. Clearly he was a character\nof the utmost respectability.\n  \n \n  \"My name's Michael Frey,\" the young man responded, smiling awkwardly.\n\"I'm afraid I don't have any cards.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, you wouldn't have had any use for them where you were. Now,\nlook here, son,\" Carpenter went on in a lowered voice, \"I know you've\njust come from the Lodge and the mistakes you'll make will be through\nignorance rather than deliberate malice. But the police wouldn't\nunderstand. You know what the sacred writings say: 'Ignorance of The\nLaw is no excuse.' I'd be glad to give you any little tips I can. For\ninstance, your hands....\"\n  \n \n  Michael spread his hands out in front of him. They were perfectly good\nhands, he thought. \"Is there something wrong with them?\"\n  \n \n  Carpenter blushed and looked away. \"Didn't you know that on Electra it\nis forbidden for anyone to appear in public with his hands bare?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I know that,\" Michael said impatiently. \"But what's that got\nto do with me?\"\n  \n \n  The salesman was wide-eyed. \"But if it is forbidden on Electra, it\nbecomes automatically prohibited here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Electrans have eight fingers on each hand,\" Michael protested,\n\"with two fingernails on each\u2014all covered with green scales.\"\n  \n \n  Carpenter drew himself up as far as it was possible to do so while\nlying down. \"Do eight fingers make one a lesser Universal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Is he inferior to you then because he has sixteen fingernails?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly not, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Would you like to be called guilty of\u2014\" Carpenter paused before the\ndreaded word\u2014\"\n   \n   intolerance\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no,\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\" Michael almost shrieked.

Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away.

He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n"

        "Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\n  \n \n  Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\n  \n \n  Kroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\n  \n \n  Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared. The idea was staggering.\n  \n \n  \"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\n  \n \n  Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The time has come.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\n  \n \n  Kroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n  \n \n  \"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\n  \n \n  Eric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\n  \n \n  For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\n  \n \n  Eric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n  \n \n  \"My brother, Garve. What about him?\"\n  \n \n  \"He loves the city. He will also stay, though he will be outside this\nbuilding.\" Kroon clasped his hands. \"Nolette, will you show Eric his\nquarters?\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Then one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\n  \n \n  The crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\n  \n \n  Eric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\n  \n \n  The crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\n  \n \n  A woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n  \n \n  \"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\n  \n \n  Eric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\n  \n \n \n \n  She said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\n  \n \n  She cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\n  \n \n  Eric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\n  \n \n  After five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\n  \n \n  The girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\n  \n \n  Eric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\n  \n \n  Eric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\n  \n \n  The door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\n  \n \n  Eric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\n  \n \n  There was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\n  \n"

They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\n  \n \n  The man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\n  \n \n  The towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\n  \n \n  And deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\n  \n \n  He seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\n  \n \n  And as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\n  \n \n  He stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\n  \n \n  He stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\n  \n \n  He turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\n  \n \n  And now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\n  \n \n  The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\n  \n \n  Yet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\n  \n \n  The ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\n  \n \n  He opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\n  \n \n  The ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\n  \n \n  Garve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\n  \n<doc-sep>The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\n  \n \n  He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\n  \n \n  The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\n  \n \n  Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\n  \n \n  Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\n  \n \n  After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\n  \n \n  They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\n  \n \n  Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\n  \n \n  Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\n  \n \n  For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\n  \n \n  Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\n  \n \n  There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\n  \n \n  He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\n  \n \n  There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\n  \n"

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n  \n \n  Only one question of importance remained:\n  \n \n  What year was this?\n  \n \n  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The\n   \n   future\n   \n  ! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\n  \n \n  And\n   \n   he\n   \n  had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n  \n \n  \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\n  \n \n \n   If\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\n  \n \n  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n  \n"

It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n"

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  My Lady Greensleeves\n  \n \n  By FREDERIK POHL\n  \n \n  Illustrated by GAUGHAN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction February 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   This guard smelled trouble and it could be\n    \n   counted on to come\u2014for a nose for trouble\n    \n   was one of the many talents bred here!\n   \n \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  His name was Liam O'Leary and there was something stinking in his\nnostrils.

        "Rat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel,\nchecked the concentrated rations and grunted.\n  \n \n  Greaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. \"The boss said strip\nher, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.\" He followed the\nCentaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock.\nThe two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building.\nOn tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. \"All set.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds nodded at him. \"Stick with it!\" and jerked a thumb at Rat\noutside. Grease nodded understanding.\n  \n \n  \"Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.\" He dropped the ladder against the\nwall and sat on it. \"Good night.\" He watched Rat walk slowly away.\n  \n \n  Swinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a\nsibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.\n  \n \n  \"Here ... can you see me?\" A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat\nregarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he\nstepped to the sill.\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\u2014in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning\nconversation drifted in. \"What you want?\"\n  \n \n  Nothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: \"Can you pilot\nthat ship?\" Her voice was shaky.\n  \n \n  He didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly\nas he detected it in her words.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\n   \n   can\n   \n  you?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Damn yes!\" he stated simply. \"It now necessary?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight.\nAnd ... well, we want\n   \n   you\n   \n  to pilot it! She refuses to risk\nMr. Roberds' job. She favors you.\"\n  \n \n  Rat stepped back, astonished. \"She?\"\n  \n \n  Nurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the\nroom, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. \"My patient,\" Nurse Gray\nexplained. \"She overheard our conversation awhile ago. Quick, please,\ncan you?\"\n  \n \n  Rat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the\nwindow. Almost immediately, he was back again.\n  \n \n  \"When?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?\" but he had gone again.\nNurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning,\nshe saw him back again.\n  \n \n  \"Blankets,\" he instructed. \"Wrap in blankets. Cold\u2014hot too. Wrap\ngood!\" And he was gone again. Gray blinked away the illusion he\ndisappeared upwards.\n  \n \n  She ran over to the girl. \"Judith, if you want to back down, now is the\ntime. He'll be back in a moment.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Judith moaned. \"No!\" Gray smiled in the darkness and began\nwrapping the blankets around her. A light tapping at the window\nannounced the return of Rat. The nurse pushed open the window wide, saw\nhim out there with arms upstretched.\n  \n \n  \"Grit your teeth and hold on! Here we go.\" She picked up the blanketed\ngirl in both arms and walked to the window. Rat took the girl easily as\nshe was swung out, the blackness hid them both. But he appeared again\ninstantly.\n  \n \n  \"Better lock window,\" he cautioned. \"Stall, if Boss call. Back\nsoon....\" and he was gone.\n  \n \n  To Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient\nagonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.\n  \n<doc-sep>They did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n  \n \n  \"I have to have a drink.\"\n  \n \n  Rat stared at her without answer.\n  \n \n  \"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n  \n \n  \"Heard you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\n  \n \n  She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\n  \n \n  They stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\n  \n \n  She burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n  \n \n  \"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\n  \n \n  Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n  \n \n  \"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n  \n \n  \"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n  \n \n  \"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\n  \n \n  Gray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\n  \n \n  No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\n   \n   upward\n   \n  , beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\n  \n \n  Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n  \n \n  \"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n  \n \n  \"And now, please, just\n   \n   how\n   \n  do I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\n  \n<doc-sep>Gladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted\nto sit up.\n  \n \n  \"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!\n   \n   When're you going to start braking\n   \n  ,\nRat?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Not brake?\n   \n  \" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n  \n \n  \"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\n  \n \n  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n  \n \n  \"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Rat shook his head and said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\n  \n \n  Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\n   \n   you\n   \n  !\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\n  \n \n  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n  \n \n  \"Earth!\" she shouted.\n  \n \n  \"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just name it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\n  \n \n  Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n  \n \n  \"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\n  \n \n  She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n  \n \n  \"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why didn't you explain?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\n  \n \n  The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n  \n \n  \"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n  \n"

He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"You're not dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n  \n \n  \"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\n  \n \n  She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He\nhad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the\ntrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on\nher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep.

The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He\npaused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have\nbeen a cinder by this time,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic\nsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished\nthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I?\nI couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shrugged her shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his\nsurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across\nthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward\nhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain\nof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated\ncone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just\nhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast\nrolling prairie.\n  \n \n  \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an\nasteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"We?\" he looked back at her.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,\nonly we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers\nAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n  \n \n  \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We hit this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that was three years ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her\neyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self\nconscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw\nyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a\nheap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp?

        "She started to laugh, and then, as she emerged from the passageway into\nthe big circular room, she cut her laugh short.\n  \n \n  A second later, as I came along, I saw why.\n  \n \n  There were two Deacons by the central desk. They were burly and had\nthat hard, pinched-face look and wore the usual black belts. Electric\nclubs hung from the belts. Spidery looking pistols were at their sides.\n  \n \n  I didn't know whether these two had heard my crack or not. I know they\nkept looking at me.\n  \n \n  Lara and I crossed the room silently, she back to her desk, I to the\nexit door. The Deacons' remote, disapproving eyes swung in azimuth,\ntracking us.\n  \n \n  I walked out and wanted to turn and smile at Lara, and get into my\nsmile something of the hope that someday, somewhere, I'd see her\nagain\u2014but of course I didn't dare.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  I had the usual difficulties at Travbur the next day. I won't go into\nthem, except to say that I was batted from office to office like a ping\npong ball, and that, when I finally got my travel permit, I was made to\nfeel that I had stolen an original Picasso from the State Museum.\n  \n \n  I made it in a day. Just. I got my permit thirty seconds before closing\ntime. I was to take the jetcopter to Center One at 0700 hours the\nfollowing morning.\n  \n \n  In my living machine that evening, I was much too excited to work at\ntheoretical research as I usually did after a hard day of tramping\naround. I bathed, I paced a while, I sat and hummed nervously and\ngot up and paced again. I turned on the telepuppets. There was a\ndrama about the space pilots who fly the nonconformist prisoners to\nthe forests and pulp-acetate plants on Mars. Seemed that the Southem\npolitical prisoners who are confined to the southern hemisphere of\nMars, wanted to attack and conquer the north. The nonconformists, led\nby our pilot, came through for the State in the end. Corn is thicker\nthan water. Standard.\n  \n \n  There were, however, some good stereofilm shots of the limitless\nforests of Mars, and I wondered what it would be like to live there, in\na green, fresh-smelling land. Pleasant, I supposed, if you could put up\nwith the no doubt revolting morality of a prison planet.\n  \n \n  And the drama seemed to point out that there was no more security for\nthe nonconformists out there than for us here on Earth. Maybe somewhere\nin the universe, I thought, there would be peace for men. Somewhere\nbeyond the solar system, perhaps, someday when we had the means to go\nthere....\n  \n \n  Yet instinct told me that wasn't the answer, either. I thought of a\nverse by an ancient pre-atomic poet named Hoffenstein. (People had\nunwieldy, random combinations of letters for names in those days.) The\npoem went:\n  \n Wherever I go,\n  \n  I\n  \n go too,\n And spoil everything.\n  \n  That was it. The story of mankind.\n  \n \n  I turned the glowlight down and lay on the pneumo after a while, but I\ndidn't sleep for a long, long time.\n  \n \n  Then, when I did sleep, when I had been sleeping, I heard the voice\nagain. The low, seductive woman's voice\u2014the startling, shocking voice\nout of my unconscious.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You have taken the first step\n   \n  ,\" she said. \"\n   \n   You are on your way\nto freedom. Don't stop now. Don't sink back into the lifelessness of\nconformity. Go on ... on and on. Keep struggling, for that is the only\nanswer....\n   \n  \"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  MUCK MAN\n  \n \n  BY FREMONT DODGE\n  \n \n  The work wasn't hard, but there were some sacrifices.\n   \n  You had to give up hope and freedom\u2014and being human!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched the\nbailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom. He recognized her as\nold Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done.\nShe didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in a\ngirl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises.\nShe was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certified\ncriminal. There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as if\nshe had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types,\nand not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.\n  \n \n  Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt\ncertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for\nthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his\nlaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n  \n \n  Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\nbehind bars.\n  \n \n  \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n  \n \n  Asa glared at him.\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the\nrap?\"\n  \n \n  \"Five or one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice\nair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a\nlot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\n  \n \n  Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly\nwith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\nSlider eggs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n  \n \n  Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because\nhe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The\nHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years\nof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's\nPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched\nworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could\nduplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n  His only problem would be staying alive for a year.\n  \n<doc-sep>They did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by\nthe knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a\ndried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely\nbitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in\nthe hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous\nhand, wiped damp hair from about her face.\n  \n \n  \"I have to have a drink.\"\n  \n \n  Rat stared at her without answer.\n  \n \n  \"I said, I have to have a drink!\"\n  \n \n  \"Heard you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, nothing. Stall. Keep water longer.\"\n  \n \n  She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made\nhis way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. \"Do\nlike this,\" he called over his shoulder. \"Gravity punk too. Back and\nunder, gravity.\" He waited until she joined him at the water tap.\n  \n \n  They stood there glaring idiotically at each other.\n  \n \n  She burst out laughing. \"They even threw the drinking cups out!\" Rat\ninched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.\n  \n \n  \"Faugh!\" Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat\ndown on the deck and spat out the water. \"It's hot! It tastes like hell\nand it's hot! It must be fuel!\"\n  \n \n  Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful\nhe swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash. Abruptly he\ncontrived a facial contortion between a grin and a grimace, and let\nsome of the water trickle from the edges of his mouth. He swallowed and\nit cost him something.\n  \n \n  \"No. I mean yes, I think. Water, no doubt. Yes. Fuel out, water in.\nSwish-swush. Dammit, Greaseball forget to wash tank!\"\n  \n \n  \"But what makes it so hot?\" She worked her mouth to dry-rinse the taste\nof the fuel.\n  \n \n  \"Ship get hot. Water on sun side. H-m-m-m-m-m-m.\"\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m-m what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop.\" He could talk with his hands as well. \"Hot side over like\npancake.\" Rat hobbled over to the board and sat down. An experimental\nflick on a lever produced nothing. Another flick, this time followed by\na quivering jar. He contemplated the panel board while fastening his\nbelt.\n  \n \n  \"H-m-m-m-m-m-m,\" the lower lip protruded.\n  \n \n  Gray protested. \"Oh, stop humming and do something! That wa\u2014\" the\nword was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled\nthe vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had\nsuddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another\nnew, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was\nempty. Bare.\n  \n \n  No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in\nthe corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded\n   \n   upward\n   \n  , beads\nglistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again\nand she looked up.\n  \n \n  Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at\nher, amazed, swinging on their stomachs. Craning further, she saw Rat.\nHe was hanging upside down in the chair, grinning at her in reverse.\n  \n \n  \"Flip-flop,\" he laconically explained.\n  \n \n  \"For cripes sakes, Jehosaphat!\" Gladney groaned. \"Turn me over on my\nback! Do something!\" Gray stood on tiptoes and just could pivot the\nhammocks on their rope-axis.\n  \n \n  \"And now, please, just\n   \n   how\n   \n  do I get into mine?\" she bit at Rat.\n  \n"

Now was my chance to\nreally see the\n   \n   Eleanor Roosevelt\n   \n  !\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You see?\"\n  \n \n  Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\nothers in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\ntheir own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\n  \n \n  The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\nspite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\nhead. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\nis a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\ntrouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n  \n \n  Svan laughed harshly. \"\n   \n   They\n   \n  don't think so. You heard them. We are\nnot human any more. The officer said it.\"\n  \n \n  The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\nagreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n  \n \n  Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n  \n \n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n  \n \n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n  \n \n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized\u2014murder?\"\n  \n \n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\nCouncilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\nEarth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial\u2014\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger\u2014\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then\u2014it will explode. Atomite.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes\u2014uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n  \n \n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n  \n \n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n  \n \n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n  \n \n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect\u2014the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar\u2014perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion\u2014that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark\u2014they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return\u2014in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n  \n \n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n  \n \n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n  \n \n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n  \n \n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it\u2014a second, ten seconds....\n  \n \n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n   \n   A traitor!\n   \n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n   \n   A coward!\n   \n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n  \n \n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but\u2014suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n  \n \n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\ntrouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n  \n \n  Svan laughed harshly. \"\n   \n   They\n   \n  don't think so. You heard them. We are\nnot human any more. The officer said it.\"\n  \n \n  The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\nagreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n  \n \n  Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n  \n \n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n  \n \n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n  \n \n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized\u2014murder?\"\n  \n \n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\nCouncilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\nEarth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial\u2014\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger\u2014\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then\u2014it will explode. Atomite.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes\u2014uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n  \n \n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n  \n \n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n  \n \n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n  \n \n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect\u2014the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar\u2014perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion\u2014that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark\u2014they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return\u2014in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n  \n \n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n  \n \n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n  \n \n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n  \n \n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it\u2014a second, ten seconds....\n  \n \n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n   \n   A traitor!\n   \n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n   \n   A coward!\n   \n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n  \n \n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but\u2014suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n  \n \n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n"

We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n  \n \n  \"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n  \n \n  \"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\n  \n \n  He flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap. They put it there with the idea that when we made\nspaceships and went to the Moon, sooner or later, we'd find the ship\nand enter it\u2014\n   \n   like rabbits in a snare!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"And now the booby-trap is on its way home,\" I guessed.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah, this ship is taking us to their planet and they're going to keep\nus there while they study us.\"\n  \n \n  \"How long will the trip take?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Six months.

Don't waste your time.\" The voice had no visible\nsource and seemed to fill the room.\n  \n<doc-sep>When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded.

        "Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and\npathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out\nin that miserable cold to meet him.\n  \n \n  The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not\ntoo clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than\nRossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were\ntears gathering in the ends of his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a\nmessage from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you\nwant a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\"\n  \n \n  The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.\nThen he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.\nIt was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He\nwas about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the\nhovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man\nappeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.\n  \n \n  \"C'n I go now, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan turned and nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Be back for you tonight,\" the young man called, and then, grinning,\nhe yelled \"Catch\" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and\nput it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A\nmoment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.\n  \n \n  \"Was he\n   \n   drunk\n   \n  ?\" Rossel began angrily. \"Was that a bottle of\n   \n   liquor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the\nenvelope in Rossel's hand. \"You'd better read that and get moving. We\nhaven't much time.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As\nRossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but\ncould not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch\nthat, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy\nclouds and the cold.\n  \n \n \n \n  After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.\n  \n<doc-sep>Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his\nhands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and\nthen, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real,\nthere was no time for that.\n  \n \n  When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he\ndid not notice the wire.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with\nmore'n ten. Why?\"\n  \n \n  His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.\n\"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take\nforty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\"\n  \n \n  Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no\niron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck\u2014she's all we\ncould afford.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that\nsomebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\"\n  \n \n  It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said\nquickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can.\nMaybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around\nhim and the scurrying people.\n  \n \n  \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\"\nBecause the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but\nhe said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or\nanother, we won't leave anybody.\"\n  \n \n  It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had\nhappened.\n  \n \n  Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then\nburied it again and packed it down real nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded.\n  \n \n  \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on\na live bomb like this, but I never....\"\n  \n \n  \"You think one of your people did it?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like\nmost government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do\nbut stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing\nwall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until\nthere was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights\nand the snow.\n  \n \n  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to\ntry to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still\ndidn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window\nthrough the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which\nwere beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still\ndrunk\u2014maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan\nheld no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind\nof guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be\nwaiting....\n  \n \n  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the\nshack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like\nto know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but\nhe said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at\nthe same time, because now they were coming to him.\n  \n \n  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it\nwas bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they\nwouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their\nship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put\na call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only\nanswer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and\nhe wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you\ncould not blame him.\n  \n \n  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man\u2014who turned out to\nbe Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically\ncleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might\nget the rest of the folks out on that.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But they have a contract!\"\n  \n \n  The soldier grinned.\n  \n \n  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:\n\"Who cut that wire, Cap?\"\n  \n"

Late in the year 2360\u2014the exact date remains unknown\u2014an alien\nforce attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage and\nthe dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the\narmy.\n  \n \n  When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists,\nthirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children,\nwere missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines,\neven books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were\nthe bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,\nnobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier\nfinally stumbled on something.\n  \n \n  For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main\nbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be\nburied in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow\na whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn\nvital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb\nat Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The\ndetonating wire had been cut.\n  \n \n  In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of\nearth, the wire had been dug up and cut.\n  \n \n  The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five\nhundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,\nweak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread\nthe news, and Man began to fall back.\n  \n \n  In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won\nstars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of\nthe colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died\nin fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those\nships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a\nsociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only\ndefense Earth had.\n  \n \n  This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth\nwith a bottle on his hip.\n  \n<doc-sep>The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide\nwarm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae;\ncuriously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans\ncome. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and sink down in the snow. He\nsaw that they were armed.\n  \n \n \n \n  He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced\nlizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been\nwatching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware\nof their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave.\n  \n \n  That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late that\nnight and he could not, of course, press the assault by day. But\n   \n   flexibility\n   \n  , he reminded himself sternly,\n   \n   is the first principle of\nabsorption\n   \n  , and therefore he moved to alter his plans. A projection\nreached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the\nhour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer\ntold him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and\nthat the attack there had probably begun.\n  \n \n  The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay\nquietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow,\nthanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he\nwould not have to venture out into that miserable cold.\n  \n \n  Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with\nuncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was\ndistinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could\ntake no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single\nbutton, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling\nof the colonists' ship.\n  \n"

        "Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and\npathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out\nin that miserable cold to meet him.\n  \n \n  The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not\ntoo clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than\nRossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were\ntears gathering in the ends of his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a\nmessage from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you\nwant a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\"\n  \n \n  The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.\nThen he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.\nIt was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He\nwas about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the\nhovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man\nappeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.\n  \n \n  \"C'n I go now, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan turned and nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Be back for you tonight,\" the young man called, and then, grinning,\nhe yelled \"Catch\" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and\nput it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A\nmoment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.\n  \n \n  \"Was he\n   \n   drunk\n   \n  ?\" Rossel began angrily. \"Was that a bottle of\n   \n   liquor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the\nenvelope in Rossel's hand. \"You'd better read that and get moving. We\nhaven't much time.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As\nRossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but\ncould not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch\nthat, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy\nclouds and the cold.\n  \n \n \n \n  After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.\n  \n<doc-sep>Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his\nhands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and\nthen, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real,\nthere was no time for that.\n  \n \n  When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he\ndid not notice the wire.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan looked at him vaguely. \"She sleeps two and won't take off with\nmore'n ten. Why?\"\n  \n \n  His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.\n\"We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take\nforty. We came out in groups, we never thought....\"\n  \n \n  Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. \"You're sure? No baggage, no\niron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck\u2014she's all we\ncould afford.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. \"It 'pears that\nsomebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.\"\n  \n \n  It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. \"All right,\" he said\nquickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, \"we'll do what we can.\nMaybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around\nhim and the scurrying people.\n  \n \n  \"Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.\"\nBecause the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but\nhe said, as kindly as he could, \"We'll get 'em all out. One way or\nanother, we won't leave anybody.\"\n  \n \n  It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had\nhappened.\n  \n \n  Dylan showed him the two clean ends. \"Somebody dug it up, cut it, then\nburied it again and packed it down real nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"The damn fool!\" Rossel exploded.\n  \n \n  \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on\na live bomb like this, but I never....\"\n  \n \n  \"You think one of your people did it?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel stared at him. \"Isn't that obvious?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like\nmost government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do\nbut stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing\nwall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until\nthere was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights\nand the snow.\n  \n \n  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to\ntry to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still\ndidn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window\nthrough the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which\nwere beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still\ndrunk\u2014maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan\nheld no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind\nof guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be\nwaiting....\n  \n \n  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the\nshack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like\nto know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but\nhe said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at\nthe same time, because now they were coming to him.\n  \n \n  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it\nwas bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they\nwouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their\nship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put\na call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only\nanswer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and\nhe wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you\ncould not blame him.\n  \n \n  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man\u2014who turned out to\nbe Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically\ncleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might\nget the rest of the folks out on that.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But they have a contract!\"\n  \n \n  The soldier grinned.\n  \n \n  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:\n\"Who cut that wire, Cap?\"\n  \n"

He was covered\nwith mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.\n  \n \n  He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it\nand brought it out.\"\n  \n \n  The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help\nme,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n  \n \n  \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's\ngot to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\nwouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n  \n \n  He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\nhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\nI've got to....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\nsuddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\ngrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\nstood out like guy wires.\n  \n \n  \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.\nPromise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n  \n \n  Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\nair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\nuse. Kapper whispered,\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cansin\n   \n  . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\nwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\nmade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n  \n \n  Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\nKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n  \n \n  \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\nBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\npushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n  \n \n  \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n  \n \n  Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n  \n \n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n  \n \n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n  \n \n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n  \n \n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n   \n   Lhak\n   \n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n  \n \n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Selak\n   \n  ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n  \n \n  I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\nbehind me. And I remembered him, then.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was\nsilent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily,\n\"Maybe an animal?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or\nfound it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think?\nThe wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one\nis cut too\u2014newly cut.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.\n  \n \n  \"So something,\" said Dylan, \"knew enough about this camp to know that\na bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that\nsomething didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the\ncenter of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then\nwalked right out again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" said Rossel, \"I'd better go ask.\"\n  \n \n  He started away but Dylan caught his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Tell them to arm,\" he said, \"and try not to scare hell out of them.\nI'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.\"\n  \n \n  Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his\nhands.\n  \n \n  He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that\nhe'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was\nperhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.\n  \n \n  All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How?\nTelepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?\n  \n \n  No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there\nwould be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really\nknow.\n  \n \n  Were they small? Little animals?\n  \n \n  Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable\nbrain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large\nas a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long\nbefore a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly\nshown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.\n  \n \n  He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.\n  \n \n  He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he\nstraightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out\nhis pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last\ntime he had fired it. He never had\u2014he never had fired a gun.\n  \n<doc-sep>She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her\nand looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced\nby the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in\nsight.\n  \n \n  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier\nhad ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left\nthe city, were not built to do so. But\n   \n   he\n   \n  was here; with luck, he\ncould capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.\n  \n \n  \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\"\n  \n \n  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened\nwire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.\n  \n \n  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted.\nNever had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar\nnon-mechanical construction.\n  \n \n  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling\nas that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling\nbody of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.\n  \n \n  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog\nthinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last\nhundred feet to sanctuary.\n  \n \n  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within\nthe tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and\nslept for several hours.\n  \n"

This type of ship,\nnecessary in our business, can stop flat, back up, ease up, move in\nany direction, and the passengers wouldn't have any feeling of motion\nat\u2014Oh, hell!\" Bob groaned, the serious glory of her eyes making him\nshake. He took her hand. \"Starre,\" he said desperately, \"I've got to\ntell you something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She jerked her hand away. \"No,\" she exclaimed in an almost frightened\nvoice. \"You can't tell me. There's\u2014there's Mac,\" she finished,\nfaltering. \"The asteroid\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You\n   \n   have\n   \n  to marry him?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes filled with tears. \"I have to live up to the bargain.\"\n  \n \n  \"And ruin your whole life,\" he ground out. Suddenly, he turned back to\nthe control board, quartered the vision plate. He pointed savagely to\nthe lower left quarter, which gave a rearward view of the dumbbell ship\ntrailing astern.\n  \n \n  \"There's your ship, Starre.\" He jabbed his finger at it. \"I've got a\nfeeling\u2014and I can't put the thought into concrete words\u2014that somehow\nthe whole solution of the problem of grabbing the asteroid back lies\nthere. But how?\n   \n   How?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Starre's blue eyes followed the long cable back to where it was\nattached around her ship's narrow midsection.\n  \n \n  She shook her head helplessly. \"It just looks like a big yo-yo to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"A yo-yo?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, a yo-yo. That's all.\" She was belligerent.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   yo-yo\n   \n  !\" Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, he\ngot out of the chair so fast. \"Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!\"\n  \n \n  He disappeared from the room. \"Queazy!\" he shouted. \"\n   \n   Queazy, I've got\nit!\n   \n  \"\n  \n<doc-sep>The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on\nreceiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you\nstanding or sitting?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and\nthe training.\n  \n \n  He hoped they were right.\n  \n \n  The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is\nwasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we\nshall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the\nship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't\n   \n   ended\n   \n  , nor did it\nmean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\nalive.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer\ncorrectly.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But it is not\u2014not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not\nknow that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is\nthe truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the\nRuler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But\nthe Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of\nlogic\"\u2014the Tr'en word seemed to mean\n   \n   right-saying\n   \n  \u2014\"who will advise\nthe Ruler. They will be called.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now\nthat their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler\ngestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n  \n \n  The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick\nus,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"\u2014\n   \n   chulad-like\n   \n  Korvin\ntranslated\u2014\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin devoutly hoped so.\n  \n"

In all the years I'd known Annabella C. Flowers,\nnever yet had I seen her desert a case until she had woven the clues\nand facts to a logical conclusion.\n  \n \n  \"Ezra,\" I said, \"we're going to drive out and meet them. There's\nsomething screwy here.\"\n  \n \n  Ten minutes later in another kite car we were driving at a fast clip\nthrough the powdery sands of the Baldric. And before long we saw\nanother car approaching.\n  \n \n  It was Grannie. As the car drew up alongside I saw her sitting in her\nprim way next to Antlers Park. Park said:\n  \n \n  \"We left the others at the mine. Miss Flowers is going back with me to\nmy offices to help me improve the formula for that new antitoxin.\"\n  \n \n  He waved his hand, and the car moved off. I watched it as it sped\nacross the desert, and a growing suspicion began to form in my mind.\nThen, like a knife thrust, the truth struck me.\n  \n \n  \"Ezra!\" I yelled, swinging the car. \"That wasn't Grannie!\n   \n   That was one\nof those damned cockatoo images.\n   \n  We've got to catch him.\"\n  \n \n  The other car was some distance ahead now. Park looked back and saw us\nfollowing. He did something to the kite wire, and his car leaped ahead.\n  \n \n  I threw the speed indicator hard over. Our kite was a huge box affair\nwith a steady powerful pull to the connecting wire. Park's vehicle\nwas drawn by a flat triangular kite that dove and fluttered with each\nvariance of the wind. Steadily we began to close in.\n  \n \n  The manager of Interstellar Voice turned again, and something glinted\nin his hand. There was a flash of purple flame, and a round hole\nappeared in our windscreen inches above Karn's head.\n  \n \n  \"Heat gun!\" Ezra yelled.\n  \n \n  Now we were rocketing over the sand dunes, winding in and out between\nthe flagpole trees. I had to catch that car I told myself. Grannie\nAnnie's very life might be at stake, not to mention the lives of\nhundreds of mine workers. Again Park took aim and again a hole\nshattered our windscreen.\n  \n \n  The wind shifted and blew from another quarter. The box kite soared,\nbut the triangular kite faltered. Taking advantage of Park's loss of\nspeed, I raced alongside.\n  \n \n  The I. V. manager lifted his weapon frantically. But before he could\nuse it a third time, Ezra Karn had whipped a lariat from his belt and\nsent it coiling across the intervening space.\n  \n \n  The thong yanked tight about the manager's throat. Park did the only\nthing he could do. He shut off power, and the two cars coasted to a\nhalt. Then I was across in the other seat, wrenching the weapon free\nfrom his grasp.\n  \n \n  \"What have you done with Miss Flowers?\" I demanded.\n  \n \n  The manager's eyes glittered with fear as he saw my finger tense on the\ntrigger. Weakly he lifted an arm and pointed to the northwest.\n  \n \n  \"Val-ley. Thir-ty miles. Entrance hidden by wall of ... flagpole trees.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Florence, Italy\n   \n  September 10\n  \n \n  Dear Joe:\n  \n \n  This telepathic control becomes more difficult every time. I must pick\ncloser points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but\nfailure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula\nthat is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were\nfilled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.\n  \n \n  I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I\nrealized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction\nthat inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there\nimmediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not\naware of the nature of my activities.\n  \n \n  I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I\nstuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered\ninto the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager\nI was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best\ncustomer.\n  \n \n  \"But why, sir?\" he asked plaintively.\n  \n \n  I was baffled. What could I tell him?\n  \n \n  \"Don't you like the rooms?\" he persisted. \"Isn't the service good?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the rooms,\" I told him. \"They're\u2014they're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"They're what?\" he wanted to know.\n  \n \n  \"They're not safe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....\"\n  \n \n  At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.\n  \n \n  \"See?\" I screamed. \"Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!\"\n  \n \n  He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.\nAnother day, another hotel.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Riley motioned for silence, but nodded. He finished the weather report,\nentered the Dome Commander's log upon the Home Office records, and\ndictated a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. Then:\n  \n \n  \"That is all,\" he concluded.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q.,\" verified the other radioman. Isobar writhed anxiously, prodded\nRiley's shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Ask him, Sparks! Go on ask him!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, cut jets, will you?\" snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked\nstartled.\n  \n \n  \"How's that? I didn't say a word\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be a dope,\" said Sparks, \"you dope! I wasn't talking to you.\nI'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock. Look, do me\na favor, chum? Can you twist your mike around so it's pointing out a\nwindow?\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Why\u2014why, yes, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Without buts,\" said Sparks grumpily. \"Yours not to reason why; yours\nbut to do or don't. Will you do it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, sure. But I don't understand\u2014\" The silver platter which had\nmirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the\ninconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun\nbriefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly\nlandscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green\ntrees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ...\npeople....\n  \n \n  \"Enough?\" asked Sparks.\n  \n \n  Isobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he\nnodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other\nradioman, \"O.Q., pal,\" he said. \"Cut!\"\n  \n \n  \"Cut!\" agreed the other. The plate blanked out.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks, Sparks,\" said Isobar.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" shrugged Riley \"\n   \n   He twisted\n   \n  the mike; not me. But\u2014how come\nyou always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open,\nJonesy? Homesick?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sort of,\" admitted Isobar guiltily.\n  \n \n  \"Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six\nmonths at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only\nmake you feel worse to see Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,\" explained Isobar. \"It's\u2014well, it's\nthe things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and\ntrees.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin.\n  \n \n  \"We've got\n   \n   them\n   \n  right here on Luna. Go look out the tower window,\nJonesy. The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest,\ngreenest little valley you ever saw.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" complained Isobar. \"And that's what makes it even worse. All\nthat pretty, soft, green stuff Outside\u2014and we ain't allowed to go out\nin it. Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To,\" interrupted a crisp voice, \"what?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander\nEagan. He squirmed.\n  \n \n  \"N-nothing, sir. I was only saying\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir!\nIt is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of\nabsolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to\ngo, for example\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Any word from them yet, sir?\" asked Sparks eagerly.\n  \n \n  \"Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones!\nWhere are\n   \n   you\n   \n  going?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014why, just back to my quarters, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I thought.

And with\n   \n   what\n   \n  , pray, Jones?\"\n  \n \n  \"With the only dratted thing,\" said Isobar, suddenly petulant, \"that\ngives me any fun around this dagnabbed place! With my bagpipe.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Llud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart\u2014but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n  \n \n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n  \n"

He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it.

He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n  \n \n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can go back.

What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n  \n \n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\n   \n   Ante\n   \n  , and to\nthe right with the word\n   \n   Post\n   \n  .\n  \n \n \n \n  Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland.

Bullen's waiting.\"\n  \n \n  He led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\n  \n \n  Snader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\n  \n \n  Bullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called.

What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n  \n \n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\n   \n   Ante\n   \n  , and to\nthe right with the word\n   \n   Post\n   \n  .\n  \n \n \n \n  Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance\nthat was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.\n  \n \n  In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past\nher. \"Official,\" he said, showing her the key. \"No lodging.\"\n  \n \n  He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it\nbehind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, where's my car?\" Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.\n  \n \n  The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster,\nthere was now a long black limousine.\n  \n \n  \"Your car is in future,\" Snader said briskly. \"Where it belong. Get\nin.\" He opened the door of the limousine.\n  \n \n  Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something\nwas happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Snader,\" he said, \"if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody\non Earth will pay ransom for us.\"\n  \n \n  Snader seemed amused. \"You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom.\nYou in different time now.\"\n  \n \n  \"When does this gag stop?\" Jeff demanded irritably. \"You haven't fooled\nus. We're still in 1957.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are? Look around.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself\nthat these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even\nthe telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely\nforeign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had\nprobably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out\nanother house.\n  \n \n  \"Get in,\" Snader said curtly.\n  \n \n  Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could\nsee no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside\nher. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He\nstarted the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb,\nnarrowly missing another car.\n  \n \n  Jeff yelled, \"Easy, man! Look where you're going!\"\n  \n \n  Snader guffawed. \"Tonight, you look where you are going.\"\n  \n \n  Ann clung to Jeff. \"Did you notice the house we came out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\"\n  \n \n  \"It looked as though they were afraid people might try to break in.\nThere were bars at the windows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lots of houses are built that way, honey. Let's see, where are we?\" He\nglanced at house numbers. \"This is the 800 block. Remember that. And\nthe street\u2014\" He peered up at a sign as they whirled around a corner.\n\"The street is Green Thru-Way. I never heard of a street like that.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  They were headed back toward what should have been the boulevard. The\ncar zoomed through a cloverleaf turn and up onto a broad freeway. Jeff\nknew for certain there was no freeway there in 1957\u2014nor in any earlier\nyear. But on the horizon, he could see the familiar dark bulk of the\nmountains. The whole line of moonlit ridges was the same as always.\n  \n \n  \"Ann,\" he said slowly, \"I think this is for real. Somehow I guess we\nescaped from 1957. We've been transported in time.\"\n  \n \n  She squeezed his arm. \"If I'm dreaming, don't wake me! I was scared a\nminute ago. But now, oh, boy!\"\n  \n \n  \"Likewise. But I still wonder what Snader's angle is.\" He leaned\nforward and tapped the driver on his meaty shoulder. \"You brought us\ninto the future instead of the past, didn't you?\"\n  \n \n  It was hard to know whether Snader was sleepy or just bored, but he\nshrugged briefly to show there was no reply coming. Then he yawned.\n  \n \n  Jeff smiled tightly. \"I guess we'll find out in good time. Let's sit\nback and enjoy the strangest ride of our lives.\"\n  \n \n  As the limousine swept along through the traffic, there were plenty\nof big signs for turn-offs, but none gave any hint where they were.\nThe names were unfamiliar. Even the language seemed grotesque. \"Rite\nChannel for Creepers,\" he read. \"Yaw for Torrey Rushway\" flared at him\nfrom a fork in the freeway.\n  \n \n  \"This can't be the future,\" Ann said. \"This limousine is almost new,\nbut it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up\nin front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center,\nablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize\nit, in spite of his familiarity with the city.\n  \n \n  Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a\ncommanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, \"Let's\nhave some answers before we go any further.\"\n  \n \n  Snader gave him a hard grin. \"You hear everything upstairs.\"\n  \n \n  The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.\n  \n \n  She said, \"It's just an apartment house. We've come this far. Might as\nwell go in and see what's there.\"\n  \n \n  Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a\ncorridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.\n  \n"

That is all.\"\n  \n \n  \"That ain't all!\" declared Isobar indignantly. \"How about my bag\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  It\n   \n   was all\n   \n  , so far as the D.C. was concerned. Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\n   \n   Cond. of\nObs.\n   \n  He noted the proper figures under the headings\n   \n   Sun Spots\n   \n  :\n   \n   Max\nFreq.\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   Min. Freq.\n   \n  ; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\n  \n \n  This done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Weather forecast for Terra\n   \n  ,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\n  \n \n  The audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\n  \n \n  Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  , Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right, Isobar.

You can go.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\n  \n \n  South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n  \n \n  \"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n  \n \n  \"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Roberts shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar's last hope flickered out.\n  \n \n  \"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\n  \n \n  Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are\n   \n   you\n   \n  doing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\n   \n   the pipes!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\n  \n \n  Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n  \n \n  \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\n   \n   Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Roberts moaned.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\n  \n \n  And Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n  \n \n  \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n  \n \n  \"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n  \n \n  \"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Stop talking!\n   \n  \" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\n   \n   Blow!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\n  \n \n \n \n   Isobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\n   \n \n \n \n  He meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Haa-a-roong!\n   \n  \" blew Isobar Jones.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  And\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\n  \n \n  As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\n  \n \n  So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n  \n \n  \"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\n   \n   like\n   \n  it! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\n  \n \n  And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\n   \n   piobaireachd\n   \n  into\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\n   \n   can\n   \n  hear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\n  \n \n  Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it; the Grannies\n   \n   liked\n   \n  this music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\n  \n \n  Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\n   \n   dared\n   \n  not\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\n   \n   Rhoderik Dhu\n   \n  and the lilting\n   \n   Lassies\nO'Skye\n   \n  , the mournful\n   \n   Coghiegh nha Shie\n   \n  whose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\n  \n \n \n   The Cock o' the North\n   \n  , he played, and\n   \n   Mironton\n   \n  ...\n   \n   Wee Flow'r o'\nDee\n   \n  and\n   \n   MacArthur's March\n   \n  ...\n   \n   La Cucuracha\n   \n  and\u2014\n  \n \n  And his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n  \n \n  \"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\n  \n \n  And Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\n  \n \n  He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\n  \n \n  Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n  \n \n  \"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014\n   \n   those Grannies are\nstone dead\n   \n  !\"\n  \n"

With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n  \n \n  Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\nout of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n  \n \n  \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a\nbook called\n   \n   Family Problems of the Frontier Woman\n   \n  . \"Remember you're\na nice boy.

What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ?

She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time.

Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\n   \n   Cond. of\nObs.\n   \n  He noted the proper figures under the headings\n   \n   Sun Spots\n   \n  :\n   \n   Max\nFreq.\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   Min.

Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\n  \n \n  Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  , Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right, Isobar.

You can go.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\n  \n \n  South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob.

His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\n   \n   impervite\n   \n  hemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n  \n \n  \"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\n  \n \n  Excitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n  \n \n  \"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick. Not even allowed to\u2014Yeah?\"\n  \n \n  It was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said,\n\"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\"\n  \n \n  \"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. But just bring\n   \n   it\n   \n  . Nothing else.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar bridled.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of\nyours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe.

Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\n  \n \n  He didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n  \n \n  \"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your\nbritches?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean\u2014Oh, thanks, no!

Watch the birdie!\"\n  \n \n  He twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n  \n \n  \"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\n  \n \n  The now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, it's\n   \n   you\n   \n  ? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know?

Ludwig\n  \n \n \n \n  Illustration by Kelly Freas\n  \n<doc-sep>All night the thought crept\nthrough my brain like a teasing\nspider:\n   \n   What can we do to make\nhim stay? What can we tell him?\nWhat, what, what?\n   \n \n \n  Unable to sleep the next morning,\nI left John to his snoring and\nwent for an aspirin and black coffee.\nAll the possible schemes were\ndrumming through my mind: finding\nan Earth blonde to capture\nJohn's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,\nbreaking his leg, forging\na letter from this mythical university\ntelling him his theory was\nproved valid and for him to take\na nice long vacation now. He was\na screwball about holes and force\nfields and dimensional worlds but\nfor that music of his I'd baby him\nthe rest of his life.\n  \n \n  It was early afternoon when I\ntrudged back to my apartment.\n  \n \n  John was squatting on the living\nroom floor, surrounded by a forest\nof empty beer bottles. His eyes were\nbulging, his hair was even wilder\nthan usual, and he was swaying.\n  \n \n  \"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\"\n  \n \n  His watery eyes squinted at me.\n\"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm\nawful scared!\"\n  \n \n  \"But you mustn't be scared. That\nreporter was just stupid. We'll help\nyou with your theory.\"\n  \n \n  His body trembled. \"No, it isn't\nthat. It isn't the reporter.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then what is it, John?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's my body. It's\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, what about your body?\nAre you sick?\"\n  \n \n  His face was white with terror.\n\"No, my\u2014\n   \n   my body's full of holes\n   \n  .\nSuppose it's one of those holes!\nHow will I get back if it is?\"\n  \n \n  He rose and staggered to his\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  , clutching it as though it\nwere somehow a source of strength\nand consolation.\n  \n \n  I patted him gingerly on the arm.\n\"Now John. You've just had too\nmuch beer, that's all. Let's go out\nand get some air and some strong\nblack coffee. C'mon now.\"\n  \n \n  We staggered out into the morning\ndarkness, the three of us. John,\nthe\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  , and I.\n  \n \n  I was hanging on to him trying\nto see around and over and even\nunder the\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  \u2014steering by a\nsort of radar-like sixth sense. The\nstreet lights on Marsport are pretty\ndim compared to Earthside. I\ndidn't see the open manhole that\nthe workmen had figured would be\nall right at that time of night. It\ngets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M.\nof a Martian morning, and I\nguess the men were warming up\nwith a little nip at the bar across\nthe street.\n  \n \n  Then\u2014he was gone.\n  \n \n  John just slipped out of my grasp\u2014\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  and all\u2014and was gone\u2014completely\nand irrevocably gone.\nI even risked a broken neck and\njumped in the manhole after him.\nNothing\u2014nothing but the smell of\nozone and an echo bouncing crazily\noff the walls of the conduit.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\"\n  \n \n  John Smith was gone, so utterly\nand completely and tragically gone\nit was as if he'd never existed....\n  \n"

During those seventy-two\ngolden hours the melodious tinkling\nof The Eye's cash register was as\nconstant as that of Santa's sleigh\nbells.\n  \n \n  John became the hero of tourists,\nspacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless\nhe remained stubbornly\naloof. He was quiet, moody, playing\nhis\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  automatically. He'd\nreveal definite indications of belonging\nto Homo Sapiens only when\ndrinking beer and talking about his\nholes.\n  \n \n  Goon-Face was still cautious.\n  \n \n  \"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe.\nWe see.

The interview,\nunfortunately, was conducted over\nthe bar and accompanied by a generous\nguzzling of beer. Fat Boy,\nHammer-Head and I watched\nfrom a table.

The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\n  \n \n  John yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\n  \n \n  John sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\n  \n \n  The reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\n  \n \n  John finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\n  \n \n  I rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there.

Ludwig\n  \n \n \n \n  Illustration by Kelly Freas\n  \n<doc-sep>We played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\n   \n   Rhapsody of The\nStars\n   \n  . He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  \u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\n  \n \n  But after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\n  \n \n  John Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought again.\n  \n \n  Awhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\n  \n \n  He pointed.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n  \n \n  \"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\n  \n \n  It didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\n  \n \n  Conclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\n  \n \n  At intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\n  \n \n  His grunt was negative.\n  \n \n  \"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled. \"Yes, I\n   \n   like\n   \n  beer.\"\n  \n \n  I escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n  \n \n  \"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\n  \n \n  John yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\n  \n \n  He made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n  \n \n  \"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\n  \n \n  His watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\n  \n \n  He yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n  \n \n  \"What\n   \n   do\n   \n  you like to do, John?\"\n  \n \n  His string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\n  \n \n  Oh Lord, that plan again!\n  \n \n  I took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\n   \n   must\n   \n  be interesting.\"\n  \n \n  He made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages. And\nthe holes provide a means of studying\nall of it first hand.\"\n  \n \n \n   Oh, oh\n   \n  , I thought.\n   \n   But you still\nhave to eat. Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n   \n \n \n  \"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls. The mine tunnels\nmake a network of holes under the\ndesert. Caves are holes, animals live\nin holes, our faces have holes,\nclothes have holes\u2014millions and\nmillions of holes!\"\n  \n \n  I winced and thought, humor\nhim because you gotta eat, you\ngotta eat.\n  \n \n  His voice trembled with emotion.\n\"Why, they're everywhere. They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\n  \n \n  He glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\n  \n \n  He was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n  \n \n  \"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  to prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools.

Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\n  \n \n  The fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\n  \n \n  His pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\n  \n \n  The bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\n  \n \n  A moment's silence.\n  \n \n  \"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n  \n \n  \"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought.\n  \n \n  My gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n  \n \n  \"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\n   \n   On An Asteroid\nWith You\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know\n   \n   everything\n   \n  ,\" said John\nSmith.\n  \n \n  I turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\n  \n \n  And I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\n  \n \n  My eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\n  \n \n  The tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\n  \n \n  First they went\n   \n   Boom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n   \n  ,\nand then,\n   \n   boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n   \n  ,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\n  \n \n  But there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\n  \n \n  I glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\n  \n \n  I looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\n  \n \n  We finished\n   \n   On An Asteroid With\nYou\n   \n  , modulated into\n   \n   Sweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\n   \n  and finished with\n   \n   Tighten Your Lips on Titan\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  We waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n  \n \n  \"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  . This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\n  \n \n  I wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\n  \n \n  He turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought.\n  \n"

        "Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked toward the ugly red mound that jutted above the green. When\nthey came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains,\nactually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on\nwalking.\n  \n \n  \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that\nthere is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it,\neither, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is\ngiven an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the\nConquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had\nto.\"\n  \n \n  He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded\nhills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied\ntogether with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond\nthem were those from\n   \n   Mars V\n   \n  , too freshly dead to have decayed\nmuch ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and\nMarsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed\nto climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched\nout, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.\n  \n \n  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds,\nred elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve\nmiles from the ship\u2014horizontally.\n  \n \n  Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the\nfresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace\nbeside the canal.\n  \n \n  He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that\nother time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so\nmuch, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of\nHelene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently\nflowing water of the cool, green canal.\n  \n \n  \"You loved her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she\nwas young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd\nbeen older when they got her.\"\n  \n \n  He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the\nleaves floating down it.\n  \n \n  \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never\nseem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\nin the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n \n  He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm\ncity. He didn't look back.\n  \n \n  \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet\nI seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago.\nAre\u2014are the climbers still climbing\u2014somewhere, Helene?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe. I doubt if even the\nMartians have the answer to that.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the city.\n  \n \n"

        "It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ...

Sun-blasted by day,\n   \n  cold-wracked by night\u2014and life condensed by\n   \n  radiation into eight days! Sim eyed the\n   \n  Ship\u2014if he only dared reach it and\n   \n  escape! ... but it was more than half an\n   \n  hour distant\u2014the limit of life itself!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1946.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  During the night, Sim was born. He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

Probably he learned long ago just\nwhat to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.\n  \n \n  \"As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's\ndiabolical work.

What's\nthe problem with this one?

Simultaneously? To the same name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was a territorial war,\" Stevenson reminded him. \"They've admitted\nthat much.

        "I wished I had been born a couple of hundred years ago\u2014before people\nstarted playing around with nuclear energy and filling the air with\nradiations that they were afraid would turn human beings into hideous\nmonsters. Instead, they developed the psi powers that had always been\nlatent in the species until we developed into a race of supermen. I\ndon't know why I say\n   \n   we\n   \n  \u2014in 1960 or so, I might have been considered\nsuperior, but in 2102 I was just the Faradays' idiot boy.\n  \n \n  Exploring space should have been my hope. If there had been anything\nuseful or interesting on any of the other planets, I might have found\na niche for myself there. In totally new surroundings, the psi powers\ngeared to another environment might not be an advantage. But by the\ntime I was ten, it was discovered that the other planets were just\nbarren hunks of rock, with pressures and climates and atmospheres\ndrastically unsuited to human life. A year or so before, the hyperdrive\nhad been developed on Earth and ships had been sent out to explore the\nstars, but I had no hope left in that direction any more.\n  \n \n  I was an atavism in a world of peace and plenty. Peace, because people\ncouldn't indulge in war or even crime with so many telepaths running\naround\u2014not because, I told myself, the capacity for primitive behavior\nwasn't just as latent in everybody else as the psi talent seemed latent\nin me. Tim must be right, I thought\u2014I must have some undreamed-of\npower that only the right circumstances would bring out. But what was\nthat power?\n  \n \n  For years I had speculated on what my potential talent might be,\nexplored every wild possibility I could conceive of and found none\nproductive of even an ambiguous result with which I could fool myself.\nAs I approached adulthood, I began to concede that I was probably\nnothing more than what I seemed to be\u2014a simple psi-negative. Yet, from\ntime to time, hope surged up again, as it had today, in spite of my\nknowledge that my hope was an impossibility. Who ever heard of latent\npsi powers showing themselves in an individual as old as twenty-six?\n  \n \n  I was almost alone in the parks where I used to walk, because people\nliked to commune with one another those days rather than with nature.\nEven gardening had very little popularity. But I found myself most at\nhome in those woodland\u2014or, rather, pseudo-woodland\u2014surroundings,\nable to identify more readily with the trees and flowers than I could\nwith my own kind. A fallen tree or a broken blossom would excite more\nsympathy from me than the minor catastrophes that will beset any\nhousehold, no matter how gifted, and I would shy away from bloody\nnoses or cut fingers, thus giving myself a reputation for callousness\nas well as extrasensory imbecility.\n  \n \n  However, I was no more callous in steering clear of human breakdowns\nthan I was in not shedding tears over the household machines when they\nbroke down, for I felt no more closely akin to my parents and siblings\nthan I did to the mechanisms that served and, sometimes, failed us.\n  \n<doc-sep>The blow shook the gun from my fingers.

We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n"

Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available.

He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\n   \n   too\n   \n  old.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\n  \n \n  Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n  \n \n  \"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n  \n \n  \"How long?\"\n  \n \n  Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make a rough estimate.\"\n  \n \n  Ball looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens whistled.\n  \n \n  Ball pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\n   \n   at least\n   \n  several thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\n  \n \n  The two men stood for a long moment in silence.

        "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Would you like to see a doctor?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens jumped at the familiar words, then realized to what the robot\nwas referring.\n  \n \n  \"No, not yet,\" he said, \"thank you.\" He swallowed hard as the robots\ncontinued waiting patiently.\n  \n \n  \"Could you tell me,\" he said at last, \"how old you are? Individually?\"\n  \n \n  \"By your reckoning,\" said his robot, and paused to make the\ncalculation, \"I am forty-four years, seven months, and eighteen days of\nage, with ten years and approximately nine months yet to be alive.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens tried to understand that.\n  \n \n  \"It would perhaps simplify our conversations,\" said the robot, \"if\nyou were to refer to me by a name, as is your custom. Using the\nfirst\u2014letters\u2014of my designation, my name would translate as Elb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" Steffens mumbled.\n  \n \n  \"You are called 'Stef,'\" said the robot obligingly.

Peb has therefore remaining some\nthirty-eight years.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens was trying to keep up. Then the life span was obviously about\nfifty-five years. But the cities, and the carbon dioxide? The robot,\nElb, had said that the Makers were similar to him, and therefore oxygen\nand plant life would have been needed. Unless\u2014\n  \n \n  He remembered the buildings on Tyban IV.\n  \n \n  Unless the Makers had not come from this planet at all.\n  \n \n  His mind helplessly began to revolve. It was Ball who restored order.\n  \n \n  \"Do you build yourselves?\" the exec asked.\n  \n \n  Peb answered quickly, that faint note of happiness again apparent, as\nif the robot was glad for the opportunity of answering.\n  \n \n  \"No, we do not build ourselves.

It is quite a long way from here.\"\n  \n \n  It was indeed a long way, even by skiff. Some of the Aliencon crew went\nalong with them. And near the edge of the twilight zone, on the other\nside of the world, they saw the Factory outlined in the dim light of\ndusk. A huge, fantastic block, wrought of gray and cloudy metal, lay in\na valley between two worn mountains. Steffens went down low, circling\nin the skiff, stared in awe at the size of the building. Robots moved\noutside the thing, little black bugs in the distance\u2014moving around\ntheir birthplace.\n  \n"

The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\n  \n \n  The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n  \n \n  \"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\n  \n \n  Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n  \n \n  \"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n  \n \n  \"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\n  \n \n  Could that be\n   \n   pain\n   \n  in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\n  \n \n  War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\n  \n \n  He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  ,\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  could live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n  \n \n  The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\n  \n \n  If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\n  \n \n  Were they immortal?\n  \n<doc-sep>Steffens had not realized that there were so many.\n  \n \n  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"What do you\n   \n   do\n   \n  ?\" Steffens asked.\n  \n \n  Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: \"We can do very\nlittle. A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n  \n \n  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n  \n \n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n  \n \n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n  \n \n  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n  \n \n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n  \n \n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n  \n \n  \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n  \n \n  \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n  \n \n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n  \n \n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n  \n \n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n  \n"

        "Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space\nship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They\nwere the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he\nrealized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown\nof concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.\n  \n \n  On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward\nthem.\n  \n \n  She said: \"Get down!\" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her\nstomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared\nafter her stupidly. \"Get down!\" she reiterated in a furious voice.\n  \n \n  He let himself to his hands and knees. \"Ouch!\" he said. He felt like\nhe was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled\nafter the girl. \"What's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. \"Centaurs!\" she said. \"I\ndidn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which\nleads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach\nthe hills we'll be safe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, personally,\" she replied, \"I never saw a Centaur until I was\nwrecked on this asteroid.\" She reached the ravine, crawled head\nforemost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom,\nwinced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the\nhills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.\n  \n \n  \"Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?\" he panted.\n  \n \n  \"Too rough. They're like horses,\" she said. \"Nothing but a goat could\nget around in the hills.\"\n  \n \n  The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a\ngorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon\nof sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the\ncrevices and floor of the canyon.\n  \n \n  They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped\naway, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her\narm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied\nit to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded\nhim. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year\n3372; not the time of ancient Greece.\n  \n \n  The canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more\nprecipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the\nuniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.\n\"Hold on,\" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette\npackage, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.\n  \n \n  \"You got a cigarette?\" he asked without much hope.\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head. \"We ran out of tobacco the first few months we\nwere here.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\" cried Ann in alarm.\n  \n \n  He said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the\nfreighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her\ngrip. \"They'd kill you,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I can sneak back,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"They might loot the ship.\nI don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley\ntobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on\nGanymede.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly\ndetached her hand.\n  \n \n  The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.\n\"We are going to the camp,\" she said.\n  \n \n  Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from\nunder her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.\n  \n \n  A voice shouted: \"What's going on there?\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who\nreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they\nhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly\nlike the neighing of horses.\n  \n \n  Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem\nof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred\nto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's\nmoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to\nthe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty\ntimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.\n  \n \n  At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults\nback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls\nresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.\nThe brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Olga,\" she confided. \"Has anybody ever told you what a handsome\nfellow you are?\" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.\n  \n \n  They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep\nvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees\nalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of\nthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.\n  \n \n  They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind\na promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming\nordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew\nthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp\nlike a bag of meal.\n  \n \n  The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner\nreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded\nand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded\nhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He\nlooked away hastily.\n  \n \n  Someone hailed them from the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"We've caught a man,\" shrieked one of his captors.\n  \n \n  A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She\nhad green eyes. \"We're rescued!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No,\" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. \"He was wrecked like us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" came a disappointed chorus.\n  \n \n  \"He's a man,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"That's the next best thing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Olga,\" said a strapping brunette. \"Who'd ever thought a man could\nlook so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"I did,\" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered\nlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt\nlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.\n  \n \n  A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,\n\"Dinner's ready.\" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of\nthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him\nappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. \"Bring him\ninto the ship,\" she said. \"The man must be starved.\"\n  \n \n  He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the\nwrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of\nthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His\nfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the\nThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.\n  \n \n  With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang\nforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be\nseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like\na captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar\nsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan\nFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild\nwomen.\n  \n"

        "He turned and walked off, not looking back.\n  \n \n  Michaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\n  \n \n  Michaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\n  \n \n  Darkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\n  \n \n  He stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\n  \n \n  There was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\n  \n \n  His wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n  \n \n  \"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n  \n \n  \"What rooms?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n  \n \n  \"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n  \n \n  \"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  A CITY NEAR CENTAURUS\n  \n \n  By BILL DOEDE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEST\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine October 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   The city was sacred, but not to its gods.\n    \n   Michaelson was a god\u2014but far from sacred!\n   \n \n \n \n  Crouched in the ancient doorway like an animal peering out from his\nburrow, Mr. Michaelson saw the native.\n  \n \n  At first he was startled, thinking it might be someone else from the\nEarth settlement who had discovered the old city before him. Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\n  \n \n  He chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\n  \n \n  He decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\n  \n \n  He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\n  \n \n  Ignoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n  \n \n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why? Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am keeper of the city.\"\n  \n \n  \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits may return.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave!\"\n  \n \n  The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\n  \n \n  He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle.

Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\n  \n \n  He chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\n  \n \n  He decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\n  \n \n  He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\n  \n \n  Ignoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\n  \n"

        "Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n<doc-sep>Old Maota read, Michaelson listened. The cadence was different, the\nsyntax confusing. But the thoughts were there. It might have been\na professor back on Earth reading to his students. Keats, Shelley,\nBrowning. These people were human, with human thoughts and aspirations.\n  \n \n  The old man stopped reading. He squatted slowly, keeping Michaelson in\nsight, and laid the book face up in the sand. Wind moved the pages.\n  \n \n  \"See?\" he said. \"The spirits read. They must have been great readers,\nthese people. They drink the book, as if it were an elixir. See how\ngentle! They lap at the pages like a new kitten tasting milk.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson laughed. \"You certainly have an imagination.\"\n  \n \n  \"What difference does it make?\" Maota cried, suddenly angry. \"You want\nto close up all these things in boxes for a posterity who may have no\nslightest feeling or appreciation. I want to leave the city as it is,\nfor spirits whose existence I cannot prove.\"\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were furious now, deadly. The gun came down directly\nin line with the Earthman's chest. The gnarled finger moved.\n  \n \n  Michaelson, using the power of the cylinder behind his ear, jumped\nbehind the old webfoot. To Maota it seemed that he had flicked out of\nexistence like a match blown out. The next instant Michaelson spun\nhim around and hit him. It was an inexpert fist, belonging to an\narcheologist, not a fighter. But Maota was an old man.\n  \n \n  He dropped in the sand, momentarily stunned. Michaelson bent over to\npick up the gun and the old man, feeling it slip from his fingers,\nhung on and was pulled to his feet.\n  \n \n  They struggled for possession of the gun, silently, gasping, kicking\nsand. Faces grew red. Lips drew back over Michaelson's white teeth,\nover Maota's pink, toothless gums. The dead city's fragile spires threw\nimpersonal shadows down where they fought.\n  \n \n  Then quite suddenly a finger or hand\u2014neither knew whose finger or\nhand\u2014touched the firing stud.\n  \n \n  There was a hollow, whooshing sound. Both stopped still, realizing the\ntotal destruction they might have caused.\n  \n \n  \"It only hit the ground,\" Michaelson said.\n  \n \n  A black, charred hole, two feet in diameter and\u2014they could not see how\ndeep\u2014stared at them.\n  \n \n  Maota let go and sprawled in the sand. \"The book!\" he cried. \"The book\nis gone!\"\n  \n \n  \"No! We probably covered it with sand while we fought.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\n  \n \n  Michaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\n  \n \n  At first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then\nit struck him.\n   \n   He was standing up!\n   \n \n \n  The cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference\nbetween himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where\nhe went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,\nleading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the\n\"clock\" was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.\n  \n \n  To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result\nas before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.\n  \n \n  \"You devil!\" Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger,\nirrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.\n\"I said you were a god. I said you were a god.\n   \n   I said you were a\ngod...!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n"

His curiosity about the instrument was colossal, but he\nforced a short laugh. \"Maota, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  complex. Why not stop all this\nmystery nonsense and tell me about it? You know more about it than I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course.\" Maota smiled a toothless, superior smile. \"What do you\nsuppose happened to this race?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  \"They took the unknown direction. The books speak of it. I don't know\nhow the instrument works, but one thing is certain. The race did not\ndie out, as a species becomes extinct.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson was amused, but interested. \"Something like a fourth\ndimension?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. I only know that with this instrument there is no death.\nI have read the books that speak of this race, this wonderful people\nwho conquered all disease, who explored all the mysteries of science,\nwho devised this machine to cheat death. See this button here on the\nface of the instrument? Press the button, and....\"\n  \n \n  \"And what?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, exactly. But I have lived many years. I have walked the\nstreets of this city and wondered, and wanted to press the button. Now\nI will do so.\"\n  \n \n  Quickly the old man, still smiling, pressed the button. A high-pitched\nwhine filled the air, just within audio range. Steady for a moment, it\nthen rose in pitch passing beyond hearing quickly.\n  \n \n  The old man's knees buckled. He sank down, fell over the bed, lay\nstill. Michaelson touched him cautiously, then examined him more\ncarefully. No question about it.\n  \n \n  The old man was dead.\n  \n<doc-sep>Maota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would not work for you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Each machine is tailored for each person.\"\n  \n \n  The old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred\nhole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\n  \n \n  He looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\n  \n \n  Michaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\"\n  \n \n  \"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n  \n \n  \"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\n  \n \n  Michaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\n  \n \n  Maota pointed to it.\n  \n \n  \"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\n  \n"

Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual task\nrequiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly on\nthe events that had brought him here.\n  \n \n  First Luna, and that had been murderous. Man had encountered Sigma\nfor the first time, and many had died before the Kendall-shield was\nperfected. And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had been\ninherently poor.\n  \n \n  Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step\u2014to Mars. But men\nhad found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm that\nhad shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt.\n  \n \n  Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had been\nwell within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a round\ntrip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible.\n  \n \n  But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of government\nand various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueled\nto within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned by\nspecialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alien\nconditions.\n  \n \n  On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred to\nwhichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition.\nThat one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage with\ncolonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell.\n  \n \n  Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of the\nexperts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions,\nhe had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in Venus\nColony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever form\nwas most needed\u2014most particularly a launching ramp\u2014and to study\nnative Venusian materials.\n  \n \n  Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When the\nlimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to\nrely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle\ndelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian\nmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.\n  \n \n  Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of\nloneliness had come to an end.\n  \n \n  She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual\ndespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment\nof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed\nemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,\nand been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded\ndevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his\ninsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.\n  \n \n  But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the\nbusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried\na considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to\nvirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.\n  \n \n  The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened\nto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly\nexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some\nfactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.\n  \n \n  Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of\nrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and\nhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have\nhimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.\n  \n \n  But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with\na fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.\n  \n \n  He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by\ninch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but\nenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into\nstuttering action.\n  \n \n  Then it was done.\n  \n \n  As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to\nstart according to calculations.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You see?\"\n  \n \n  Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five\nothers in the room looked apprehensive. \"You see?\" Svan repeated. \"From\ntheir own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.\"\n  \n \n  The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in\nspite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her\nhead. \"Svan, I'm afraid,\" she said. \"Who are we to decide if this\nis a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be\ntrouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.\"\n  \n \n  Svan laughed harshly. \"\n   \n   They\n   \n  don't think so. You heard them. We are\nnot human any more. The officer said it.\"\n  \n \n  The other woman spoke unexpectedly. \"The Council was right,\" she\nagreed. \"Svan, what must we do?\"\n  \n \n  Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. \"One moment. Ingra, do you still\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked\naround at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly\nconvinced by Svan.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said slowly. \"I do not object.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the rest of us? Does any of us object?\"\n  \n \n  Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of\nassent.\n  \n \n  \"Good,\" said Svan. \"Then we must act. The Council has told us that we\nalone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the\nEarth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not\nreturn.\"\n  \n \n  An old man shifted restlessly. \"But they are strong, Svan,\" he\ncomplained. \"They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.\"\n  \n \n  Svan nodded. \"No. They will leave. But they will never get back to\nEarth.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never get back to Earth?\" the old man gasped. \"Has the Council\nauthorized\u2014murder?\"\n  \n \n  Svan shrugged. \"The Council did not know what we would face. The\nCouncilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the\nEarth-ship has.\" He paused dangerously. \"Toller,\" he said, \"do you\nobject?\"\n  \n \n  Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was\ndull. \"What is your plan?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his\nfeet, held up a shiny metal globe. \"One of us will plant this in the\nship. It will be set by means of this dial\u2014\" he touched a spot on the\nsurface of the globe with a pallid finger\u2014\"to do nothing for forty\nhours. Then\u2014it will explode. Atomite.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin\nfaded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes\u2014uncertainty,\nirresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves\noff a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a\nmark on one of them, held it up.\n  \n \n  \"We will let chance decide who is to do the work,\" he said angrily. \"Is\nthere anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....\"\n  \n \n  No answer. Svan jerked his head. \"Good,\" he said. \"Ingra, bring me that\nbowl.\"\n  \n \n  Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm\nof her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few\nleft. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly\ncreasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it\nwith his hand, offered it to the girl. \"You first, Ingra,\" he said.\n  \n \n  She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip\nand held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan\nhimself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their\nslips.\n  \n \n  Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.\n\"This is the plan,\" he said. \"We will go, all six of us, in my ground\ncar, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect\u2014the whole city\nhas been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can\nfind. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.\nThe other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the\ncar\u2014perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The\nguards will be called. There will be commotion\u2014that is easy enough,\nafter all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to\nit. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side\nof the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the\ndark\u2014they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away\nfrom the sun to return\u2014in forty hours the danger is removed.\"\n  \n \n  There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that\nuncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: \"Look at the slips!\"\n  \n \n  Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.\nInstinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,\nstriving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....\n  \n \n  And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's\nglance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.\nAlmost he was disappointed.\n  \n \n  Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking\nup now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen\none to announce it\u2014a second, ten seconds....\n  \n \n  Then gray understanding came to him.\n   \n   A traitor!\n   \n  his subconscious\nwhispered.\n   \n   A coward!\n   \n  He stared at them in a new light, saw their\nindecision magnified, became opposition.\n  \n \n  Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a\ncoward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might\nbe the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting\nevery one, but\u2014suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions\nof a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.\nMasked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly\nbeneath the table, marked his own slip.\n  \n \n  In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in\nsecret. His voice was very tired as he said, \"I will plant the bomb.\"\n  \n"

The\nfootball-sized chunk of nickel-iron and rock overtook the ship at a\nrelative speed of only a few hundred miles per hour and passed close\nenough to come within the tremendous pseudo-gravatic fields of the\nidling drivers.\n  \n \n  It swerved into a paraboloid course, following the flux lines, and was\ndragged directly against one of the three projecting nozzles. Energy\nof motion was converted to heat and a few meteoric fragments fused\nthemselves to the nonmetallic tube casing.\n  \n \n  In the jet room the positronic line accelerator for that particular\ndriver fouled under the intolerable overload, and the backsurge sent\nsearing heat and deadly radiation blasting through the compartment\nbefore the main circuit breakers could clack open.\n  \n \n  The bellow of the alarm horn brought Barry Barr fully awake, shattering\na delightfully intimate dream of the dark haired girl he hoped to see\nagain soon in Venus Colony. As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started\naft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly\nthat Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers.\n  \n \n  Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet\nroom door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was\nmanipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One\nby one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence.\n  \n \n  The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable\nconditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open.\nQuickly the commander entered the blasted jet room. Barry Barr was\nclose behind him.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind, jet chief of Four and electronics expert for Venus Colony,\nhung back until others had gone in first. His handsome, heavy face had\nlost its usual ruddiness.\n  \n \n  Captain Reno surveyed the havoc. Young Ryan's body floated eerily in\nthe zero gravity, charred into instant death by the back-blast. The\nline accelerator was a shapeless ruin, but except for broken meter\nglasses and scorched control handles other mechanical damage appeared\nminor. They had been lucky.\n  \n \n  \"Turnover starts in six hours twelve minutes,\" the captain said\nmeaningfully.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind cleared his throat. \"We can change accelerators in two\nhours,\" he declared. With a quick reassumption of authority he began to\norder his crew into action.\n  \n \n  It took nearer three hours than two to change accelerators despite\nHind's shouted orders.\n  \n \n  At last the job was completed. Hind made a final check, floated over to\nthe control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he\nthrew in the accelerator switch.\n  \n \n  The meter needles climbed, soared past the red lines without pausing,\nand just in time to prevent a second blowback, Hind cut the power.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   There's metal in the field!\n   \n  \" His voice was high and unsteady.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

We're\nguinea pigs!\"\n  \n \n  \"Did they use telepathy to explain?\" Verana asked. I suddenly\nremembered that she was a member of a club that investigated\nextra-sensory perception with the hope of learning how it operated. She\nwas probably sorry she hadn't been contacted telepathically.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Kane replied. \"I saw all sorts of mental pictures and they\nexplained what they did to us. Those damned aliens want us for their\nzoo!\"\n  \n \n  \"Start at the beginning,\" I suggested.\n  \n \n  He flashed an angry glance at me, but seemed to calm somewhat. \"This\nship was made by a race from another galaxy. Thousands of years ago,\nthey came to Earth in their spaceships when men were primitives living\nin caves. They wanted to know what our civilization would be like\nwhen we developed space flight. So they put this ship on the Moon as a\nsort of booby-trap.

        "Barry developed definite external signs of what the Sigma radiation had\ndone to him. The skin between his fingers and toes spread, grew into\nmembranous webs. The swellings in his neck became more pronounced and\ndark parallel lines appeared.\n  \n \n  But despite the doctor's pessimistic reports that the changes had not\nstopped, Barry continued to tell himself he was recovering. He had\nto believe and keep on believing to retain sanity in the face of the\nweird, unclassifiable feelings that surged through his body. Still\nhe was subject to fits of almost suicidal depression, and Dorothy's\nfailure to visit him did not help his mental condition.\n  \n \n  Then one day he woke from a nap and thought he was still dreaming.\nDorothy was leaning over him.\n  \n \n  \"Barry! Barry!\" she whispered. \"I can't help it. I love you even if you\ndo have a wife and child in Philadelphia. I know it's wrong but all\nthat seems so far away it doesn't matter any more.\" Tears glistened in\nher eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\" he grunted. \"Who? Me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, Barry, don't lie. She wrote to me before Three blasted\noff\u2014oh, the most piteous letter!\"\n  \n \n  Barry was fully awake now. \"I'm not married. I have no child.\nI've never been in Philadelphia,\" he shouted. His lips thinned.\n\"I\u2014think\u2014I\u2014know\u2014who\u2014wrote\u2014that\u2014letter!\" he declared grimly.\n  \n \n  \"Robson wouldn't!\" she objected, shocked, but there was a note of doubt\nin her voice.\n  \n \n  Then she was in his arms, sobbing openly.\n  \n \n  \"I believe you, Barry.\"\n  \n \n  She stayed with him for hours, and she had changed since the days\nat Training Base. Long months away from the patterned restraints of\ncivilization, living each day on the edge of unknown perils, had\nawakened in her the realization that she was a human being and a\nwoman, as well as a toxicologist.\n  \n \n  When the water-mist finally forced her departure she left Barry joyous\nand confident of his eventual recovery. For a few minutes anger\nsimmered in his brain as he contemplated the pleasure of rearranging\nRobson Hind's features.\n  \n \n  The accident with the scaffold had been remarkably convenient, but\nthis time the ruthless, restless, probably psychopathic drive that had\nmade Robson Hind more than just another rich man's spoiled son had\ncarried him too far. Barry wondered whether it had been inefficiency or\njudiciously distributed money that had made the psychometrists overlook\nsome undesirable traits in Hind's personality in accepting him for the\nFive Ship Plan.\n  \n \n  But even with his trickery Hind had lost.\n  \n \n  He slept, and woke with a feeling of doom.\n  \n \n  The slow Venusian twilight had ended in blackness and the overhead\ntubelight was off.\n  \n \n  He sat up, and apprehension gave way to burning torture in his chest.\n  \n \n  Silence! He fumbled for the light switch, then knelt beside the mist\nmachine that no longer hummed. Power and water supplies were both dead,\ncut off outside his room.\n  \n \n  Floating droplets were merging and falling to the floor. Soon the air\nwould be dry, and he would be choking and strangling. He turned to call\nfor help.\n  \n \n  The door was locked!\n  \n \n  He tugged and the knob came away in his hand. The retaining screw had\nbeen removed.\n  \n \n  He beat upon the panel, first with his fists and then with the metal\ndoorknob, but the insulation between the double alloy sheets was\nefficient soundproofing. Furiously he hurled himself upon it, only to\nbounce back with a bruised shoulder. He was trapped.\n  \n \n  Working against time and eventual death he snatched a metal chair\nand swung with all his force at the window, again, again, yet again.\nA small crack appeared in the transparent plastic, branched under\ncontinued hammering, became a rough star. He gathered his waning\nstrength, then swung once more. The tough plastic shattered.\n  \n \n  He tugged at the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame. Fog-laden\nVenusian air poured in\u2014but it was not enough!\n  \n \n  He dragged himself head first through the narrow opening, landed\nsprawling on hands and knees in the darkness. In his ears a confused\nrustling drone from the alien swamp mingled with the roar of\napproaching unconsciousness.\n  \n \n  There was a smell in his nostrils. The smell of water. He lurched\nforward at a shambling run, stumbling over the uneven ground.\n  \n \n  Then he plunged from the rocky ledge into the slough. Flashes of\ncolored light flickered before his eyes as he went under. But Earth\nhabits were still strong; instinctively he held his breath.\n  \n \n  Then he fainted. Voluntary control of his body vanished. His mouth hung\nslack and the breathing reflex that had been an integral part of his\nlife since the moment of birth forced him to inhale.\n  \n \n  Bubbles floated upward and burst. Then Barry Barr was lying in the ooze\nof the bottom. And he was breathing, extracting vital oxygen from the\nbrackish, silt-clouded water.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Slowly his racing heartbeat returned to normal. Gradually he became\naware of the stench of decaying plants and of musky taints he knew\ninstinctively were the scents of underwater animals. Then with a shock\nthe meaning became clear. He had become a water-breather, cut off from\nall other Earthmen, no longer entirely human. His fellows in the colony\nwere separated from him now by a gulf more absolute than the airless\nvoid between Earth and Venus.\n  \n \n  Something slippery and alive touched him near one armpit. He opened\nhis eyes in the black water and his groping hand clutched something\nburrowing into his skin. With a shudder of revulsion he crushed a fat\nworm between his fingers.\n  \n \n  Then dozens of them\u2014hundreds\u2014were upon him from all sides. He was\nwearing only a pair of khaki pants but the worms ignored his chest to\ncongregate around his face, intent on attacking the tender skin of his\neyelids.\n  \n \n  For a minute his flailing hands fought them off, but they came in\nincreasing numbers and clung like leeches. Pain spread as they bit and\nburrowed, and blindly he began to swim.\n  \n \n  Faster and faster. He could sense the winding banks of the slough and\nkept to midchannel, swimming with his eyes tightly closed. One by one\nthe worms dropped off.\n  \n \n  He stopped, opened his eyes, not on complete darkness this time but on\na faint blue-green luminescence from far below. The water was saltier\nhere, and clearer.\n  \n \n  He had swum down the slough and out into the ocean. He tried to turn\nback, obsessed by a desire to be near the colony even though he\ncould not go ashore without strangling, but he had lost all sense of\ndirection.\n  \n \n  He was still weak and his lungs were not completely adjusted to\nunderwater life. Again he grew dizzy and faint. The slow movements of\nhands and feet that held him just below the surface grew feeble and\nceased. He sank.\n  \n \n  Down into dimly luminous water he dropped, and with his respiratory\nsystem completely water-filled there was no sensation of pressure. At\nlast he floated gently to the bottom and lay motionless.\n  \n \n  Shouting voices awakened him, an exultant battle cry cutting through a\ngasping scream of anguish. Streaks of bright orange light were moving\ntoward him in a twisting pattern. At the head of each trail was a\nfigure. A human figure that weaved and swam in deadly moving combat.\nOne figure drifted limply bottomward.\n  \n \n  Hallucination, Barry told himself. Then one of the figures broke from\nthe group. Almost overhead it turned sharply downward and the feet\nmoved in a powerful flutter-kick. A slender spear aimed directly at the\nEarthman.\n  \n \n  Barry threw himself aside. The spear point plunged deep into the\nsticky, yielding bottom and Barry grappled with its wielder.\n  \n \n  Pointed fingernails raked his cheek. Barry's balled fist swung\nin a roundhouse blow but water resistance slowed the punch to\nineffectiveness. The creature only shook its head and came in kicking\nand clawing.\n  \n \n  Barry braced his feet against the bottom and leaped. His head butted\nthe attacker's chest and at the same instant he lashed a short jab to\nthe creature's belly. It slumped momentarily, its face working.\n  \n \n  Human\u2014or nearly so\u2014the thing was, with a stocky, powerful body and\nwebbed hands and feet. A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more\nfor ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face\nwas coarse and savage.\n  \n \n  It shook off the effects of Barry's punch and one webbed hand snatched\na short tube from its belt.\n  \n \n  Barry remembered the spring-opening knife in his pocket, and even as\nhe flicked the blade out the tube-weapon fired. Sound thrummed in the\nwater and the water grew milky with a myriad of bubbles. Something\nzipped past his head, uncomfortably close.\n  \n \n  Then Barry struck, felt his knife slice flesh and grate against bone.\nHe struck again even as the undersea being screamed and went limp.\n  \n \n  Barry stared through the reddening water.\n  \n \n  Another figure plunged toward him. Barry jerked the dead Venusian's\nspear from the mud and raised it defensively.\n  \n \n  But the figure paid no attention. This one was a female who fled\ndesperately from two men closing in from opposite sides. One threw his\nspear, using an odd pushing motion, and as she checked and dodged, the\nother was upon her from behind.\n  \n \n  One arm went around her neck in a strangler's hold, bending her slender\nbody backward. Together captor and struggling captive sank toward the\nbottom. The other recovered his thrown spear and moved in to help\nsecure her arms and legs with lengths of cord.\n  \n \n  One scooped up the crossbow the girl had dropped. The other ripped at\nher brief skirt and from her belt took a pair of tubes like the one the\ndead Venusian had fired at Barry, handling them as though they were\nloot of the greatest value. He jerked cruelly at the slender metallic\nnecklace the girl wore but it did not break.\n  \n \n  He punched the helpless girl in the abdomen with the butt of his spear.\nThe girl writhed but she did not attempt to cry out.\n  \n \n  Barry bounded toward them in a series of soaring leaps, knife and spear\nready. One Venusian turned to meet him, grinning maliciously.\n  \n \n  Barry dug one foot into the bottom and sidestepped a spear thrust. His\nown lunge missed completely. Then he and the Venusian were inside each\nother's spear points, chest to chest. A pointed hook strapped to the\ninside of the creature's wrist just missed Barry's throat. The Earthman\narched his body backward and his knife flashed upward. The creature\ngasped and pulled away, clutching with both hands at a gaping wound in\nits belly.\n  \n \n  The other one turned too late as Barry leaped.\n  \n \n  Barry's hilt cracked against its jawbone.\n  \n<doc-sep>The blazing disc of Sol, the minor globes of the planets, the unwinking\npinpoints of the stars, all stared with cosmic disinterest at the tiny\nfigure crawling along the hull.

        " \n  Venus Is a Man's World\n  \n \n  BY WILLIAM TENN\n  \n \n  Illustrated by GENE FAWCETTE\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took\n   \n  over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!\n  \n \n \n  I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me\u2014and a\ngirl besides\u2014she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship\njam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves\nhusbands in the one place they're still to be had\u2014the planet\nVenus\u2014and you know I'll be in trouble.\n  \n \n  Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n  \n \n  Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled\nout of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n  \n \n  \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a\nbook called\n   \n   Family Problems of the Frontier Woman\n   \n  . \"Remember you're\na nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n  \n \n  I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in\nfront of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their\nhammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's\ncrews are men; women are too busy with important things like government\nto run ships. I felt free all over\u2014and happy. Now was my chance to\nreally see the\n   \n   Eleanor Roosevelt\n   \n  !\n  \n<doc-sep>The blazing disc of Sol, the minor globes of the planets, the unwinking\npinpoints of the stars, all stared with cosmic disinterest at the tiny\nfigure crawling along the hull. His spacesuit trapped and amplified\nbreathing and heartbeats into a roaring chaos that was an invitation\nto blind panic, and all the while there was consciousness of the\ninsidiously deadly Sigma radiations.\n  \n \n  Barry found the debris of the meteorite, an ugly shining splotch\nagainst the dull superceramic tube, readied his power chisel, started\ncutting. Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual task\nrequiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly on\nthe events that had brought him here.\n  \n \n  First Luna, and that had been murderous. Man had encountered Sigma\nfor the first time, and many had died before the Kendall-shield was\nperfected. And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had been\ninherently poor.\n  \n \n  Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step\u2014to Mars. But men\nhad found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm that\nhad shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt.\n  \n \n  Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had been\nwell within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a round\ntrip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible.\n  \n \n  But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of government\nand various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueled\nto within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned by\nspecialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alien\nconditions.\n  \n \n  On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred to\nwhichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition.\nThat one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage with\ncolonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell.\n  \n \n  Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of the\nexperts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions,\nhe had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in Venus\nColony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever form\nwas most needed\u2014most particularly a launching ramp\u2014and to study\nnative Venusian materials.\n  \n \n  Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When the\nlimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to\nrely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle\ndelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian\nmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.\n  \n \n  Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of\nloneliness had come to an end.\n  \n \n  She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual\ndespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment\nof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed\nemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,\nand been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded\ndevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his\ninsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.\n  \n \n  But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the\nbusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried\na considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to\nvirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.\n  \n \n  The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened\nto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly\nexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some\nfactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.\n  \n \n  Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of\nrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and\nhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have\nhimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.\n  \n \n  But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with\na fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.\n  \n \n  He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by\ninch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but\nenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into\nstuttering action.\n  \n \n  Then it was done.\n  \n \n  As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to\nstart according to calculations.\n  \n<doc-sep>She shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rebellion?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt\nbehind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate\nexpiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one\nrace now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n  \n \n  They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not\ntalk about them any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of\ntransportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head, bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life\non Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n  \n \n  He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't\nunderstand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n  \n \n  After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the\nmatter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely\nyou have space travel?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean\u2014space travel?\"\n  \n \n  He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A\ncivilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories\nwouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   ship\n   \n  ? Oh, you mean something like a\n   \n   vliegvlotter\n   \n  . Why, no, I\ndon't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a\nthing like that?\"\n  \n \n  He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her\narms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this\nperfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as\nyou know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is\nthat right?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n  \n \n  He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he\nlooked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give\nhis life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I\nwould when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n  \n"

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Sitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to\nlet him have it at the first sight of actual violence.\n  \n \n  Heraal boomed, \"You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have\nnotified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the\ndeath of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!\"\n  \n \n  \"Watch it, Chief,\" Stebbins yelled. \"He's going to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun\ntrigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it\nsavagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the\nsword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of\nbluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.\n  \n \n  Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door\nflew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the\ngreen sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down\nat the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.\n  \n \n  \"You are J. F. Corrigan?\" the leader asked.\n  \n \n  \"Y-yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint\nbeing\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the\nuntimely death of an intelligent life-form,\" filled in the second of\nthe Ghrynian policemen.\n  \n \n  \"The evidence lies before us,\" intoned the leader, \"in the cadaver\nof the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several\nminutes ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"And therefore,\" said the third lizard, \"it is our duty to arrest\nyou for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than\n$100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" I stormed. \"You mean that any being from anywhere in the\nUniverse can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  responsible?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to\nthis late life-form's request lies at the root of his sad demise?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, no, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.\"\n  \n"

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director.

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n"

The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.",
        "\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Five doctors were bustling back and forth as Walton entered the main\nsection of the clinic. There must have been a hundred babies there,\neach in a little pen of its own, and the doctors were humming from one\nto the next, while anxious parents watched from screens above.\n  \n \n  The Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its\nlocal clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a\ncertificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a\ncertificate ... and life.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Mr. Walton. What brings you down here?\"\n  \n \n  Walton smiled affably. \"Just a routine investigation, Doctor. I try to\nkeep in touch with every department we have, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. FitzMaugham was down here to look around a little while ago. We're\nreally getting a going-over today, Mr. Walton!\"\n  \n \n  \"Umm. Yes.\" Walton didn't like that, but there was nothing he could\ndo about it. He'd have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose.\n  \n \n  \"Seen my brother around?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Fred? He's working in room seven, running analyses. Want me to get him\nfor you, Mr. Walton?\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014no, don't bother him, thanks. I'll find him later.\" Inwardly,\nWalton felt relieved. Fred Walton, his younger brother, was a doctor in\nthe employ of Popeek. Little love was lost between the brothers, and\nRoy did not care to have Fred know he was down there.\n  \n \n  Strolling casually through the clinic, he peered at a few plump,\nsqualling babies, and said, \"Find many sour ones today?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seven so far. They're scheduled for the 1100 chamber. Three tuberc,\ntwo blind, one congenital syph.\"\n  \n \n  \"That only makes six,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, and a spastic,\" the doctor said. \"Biggest haul we've had yet.\nSeven in one morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have any trouble with the parents?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you think?\" the doctor asked. \"But some of them seemed to\nunderstand. One of the tuberculars nearly raised the roof, though.\"\n  \n \n  Walton shuddered. \"You remember his name?\" he asked, with feigned calm.\n  \n \n  Silence for a moment. \"No. Darned if I can think of it. I can look it\nup for you if you like.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother,\" Walton said hurriedly.\n  \n \n  He moved on, down the winding corridor that led to the execution\nchamber. Falbrough, the executioner, was studying a list of names at\nhis desk when Walton appeared.\n  \n \n  Falbrough didn't look like the sort of man who would enjoy his work. He\nwas short and plump, with a high-domed bald head and glittering contact\nlenses in his weak blue eyes. \"Morning, Mr. Walton.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Doctor Falbrough. You'll be operating soon, won't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hundred, as usual.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. There's a new regulation in effect from now on,\" Walton said.\n\"To keep public opinion on our side.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Henceforth, until further notice, you're to check each baby that\ncomes to you against the main file, just to make sure there's been no\nmistake. Got that?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mistake?\n   \n  But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one\nof the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets\nout.\"\n   \n   How glibly I reel this stuff off\n   \n  , Walton thought in amazement.\n  \n \n  Falbrough looked grave. \"I see, sir. Of course. We'll double-check\neverything from now on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Begin with the 1100 batch.\"\n  \n \n  Walton couldn't bear to remain down in the clinic any longer. He left\nvia a side exit, and signaled for a lift tube.\n  \n \n  Minutes later he was back in his office, behind the security of a\ntowering stack of work. His pulse was racing; his throat was dry. He\nremembered what FitzMaugham had said:\n   \n   Once we make even one exception,\nthe whole framework crumbles.\n   \n \n \n  Well, the framework had begun crumbling, then. And there was little\ndoubt in Walton's mind that FitzMaugham knew or would soon know what he\nhad done. He would have to cover his traces, somehow.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed and said, \"Dr. Falbrough of Happysleep calling\nyou, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Put him on.\"\n  \n \n  The screen lit and Falbrough's face appeared; its normal blandness had\ngiven way to wild-eyed tenseness.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Doctor?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a good thing you issued that order when you did, sir! You'll\nnever guess what just happened\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No guessing games, Falbrough. Speak up.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014well, sir, I ran checks on the seven babies they sent me this\nmorning. And guess\u2014I mean\u2014well, one of them shouldn't have been sent\nto me!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the truth, sir. A cute little baby indeed. I've got his card\nright here. The boy's name is Philip Prior, and his gene-pattern is\nfine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any recommendation for euthanasia on the card?\" Walton asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton chewed at a ragged cuticle for a moment, counterfeiting great\nanxiety. \"Falbrough, we're going to have to keep this very quiet.\nSomeone slipped up in the examining room, and if word gets out that\nthere's been as much as one mistake, we'll have a mob swarming over us\nin half an hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\" Falbrough looked terribly grave. \"What should I do, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't say a word about this to\n   \n   anyone\n   \n  , not even the men in the\nexamining room. Fill out a certificate for the boy, find his parents,\napologize and return him to them. And make sure you keep checking for\nany future cases of this sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly, sir. Is that all?\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep\nbreath and stared bleakly at the far wall.\n  \n \n  The Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law\u2014the Equalization\nLaw\u2014Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal\nas the man who tried to hide his dying father from the investigators,\nor the anxious parents who attempted to bribe an examining doctor.\n  \n \n  He felt curiously dirty. And, now that he had betrayed FitzMaugham and\nthe Cause, now that it was done, he had little idea why he had done\nit, why he had jeopardized the Popeek program, his position\u2014his life,\neven\u2014for the sake of one potentially tubercular baby.\n  \n \n  Well, the thing was done.\n  \n \n  No. Not quite. Later, when things had quieted down, he would have to\nfinish the job by transferring all the men in the clinic to distant\nplaces and by obliterating the computer's memories of this morning's\nactivities.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed again. \"Your brother is on the wire, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton trembled imperceptibly as he said, \"Put him on.\" Somehow, Fred\nnever called unless he could say or do something unpleasant. And\nWalton was very much afraid that his brother meant no good by this\ncall. No good at all.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Roy Walton watched his brother's head and shoulders take form out of\nthe swirl of colors on the screen. Fred Walton was more compact, built\ncloser to the ground than his rangy brother; he was a squat five-seven,\nnext to Roy's lean six-two. Fred had always threatened to \"get even\"\nwith his older brother as soon as they were the same size, but to\nFred's great dismay he had never managed to catch up with Roy in height.\n  \n \n  Even on the screen, Fred's neck and shoulders gave an impression of\ntremendous solidity and force. Walton waited for his brother's image to\ntake shape, and when the time lag was over he said, \"Well, Fred? What\ngoes?\"\n  \n \n  His brother's eyes flickered sleepily. \"They tell me you were down here\na little while ago, Roy. How come I didn't rate a visit?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wasn't in your section. It was official business, anyway. I didn't\nhave time.\"\n  \n \n  Walton fixed his eyes sharply on the caduceus emblem gleaming on Fred's\nlapel, and refused to look anywhere else.\n  \n \n  Fred said slowly, \"You had time to tinker with our computer, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"Official business!\"\n  \n \n  \"Really, Roy?\" His brother's tone was venomous. \"I happened to\nbe using the computer shortly after you this morning. I was\ncurious\u2014unpardonably so, dear brother. I requested a transcript of\nyour conversation with the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks seemed to flow from the screen. Walton sat back, feeling numb.\nHe managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and\nsay, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek\ncomputer outlet is confidential.\"\n  \n \n  \"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two of us, then. Eh,\nRoy?\"\n  \n \n  \"How much do you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't want me to recite it over a public communications system,\nwould you? Your friend FitzMaugham might be listening to every word of\nthis, and I have too much fraternal feeling for that. Ole Doc Walton\ndoesn't want to get his bigwig big brother in trouble\u2014oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks for small blessings,\" Roy said acidly.\n  \n \n  \"You got me this job. You can take it away.

I'm borrowing\na bit of Johnny's strategy. I've been plotting his course. As soon as\nI'm sure of his destination, we'll take care of\n   \n   him\n   \n  . But our first\nand most vital problem is to locate the Lorelei's hideaway.\"\n  \n \n  Syd said, \"That's all right with me, chum. I like a good scrap as much\nas the next guy. Better, maybe. But this isn't our concern, strictly\nspeaking. What we ought to do is report this matter to the Space\nPatrol, let them take care of it.\"\n  \n \n  Salvation shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"That's where you're mistaken, Sydney.

Chip and Johnny were\nold buddies. Lifelong friends!\"\n  \n \n  \"Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence indicates Chip's guilt.\nTwenty men saw him standing over Johnny's dead body, with a\nflame-pistol in his hand. And the barkeep heard Johnny 'arrest' Chip\nand accuse him of murder!\"\n  \n \n  Chip said ruefully, \"That's right, Syd. It was only a joke, but it\nbackfired. The bartender thought Johnny meant it. He scooted out of\nthere like a bat out of Hades. I'm in it up to my neck unless we can\nbring back evidence that Scarface actually did the killing. And that\nmay not be so easy.\"\n  \n \n  He stirred restlessly. \"But we'll cross that bridge when we come to\nit. Right now our job is to keep this rat in sight. We've gone farther\nalready than I expected we would.\" He turned to the old preacher.\n\"Where do you think we're going, Padre? Out of the Belt entirely?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been wondering that myself, son. I don't know for sure, of\ncourse, but it looks to me as if we're going for the Bog. If so, you'd\nbetter keep a weather-eye peeled.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bog!\" Chip had never penetrated the planetoids so deeply before,\nbut he knew of the Bog by hearsay. All men did. A treacherous region of\ntightly packed asteroids, a mad and whirling scramble of the gigantic\nrocks which, aeons ago, had been a planet. Few spacemen dared penetrate\nthe Bog.

        "Chip stared at his friend bewilderedly for a moment. Then he grinned.\n\"Hey\u2014I must be getting slightly whacky in my old age. I stand here\nwith an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I\nthought you said 'Lorelei.' The Lorelei, my space-cop friend, is a\nmyth. An old Teutonic myth about a beautiful damsel who sits out in\nthe middle of a sea on a treacherous rock, combing her golden locks,\nwarbling and luring her fascinated admirers to destruction.\"\n  \n \n  He grunted. \"A dirty trick, if you ask me. Catch a snort of this\nalleged Scotch, pal, and I'll torture your eardrums with the whole, sad\nstory.\" He started to sing. \"'\n   \n   Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten\n   \n  \u2014'\"\n  \n \n  The Patrolman laid a hand on his arm, silenced him.\n  \n \n  \"It's not funny, Chip. You've described the Lorelei exactly. That's\nhow she got her name. An incredibly beautiful woman who wantonly lures\nspace-mariners to their death.\n  \n \n  \"The only difference is that her 'rock' is an asteroid somewhere in\nthe Belt\u2014and she does not sing, she calls! She began exercising\nher vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth reckoning. Since\nthen, no less than a dozen spacecraft\u2014freighters, liners, even one\nPatrolship\u2014have fallen prey to her wiles. Their crews have been\nbrutally murdered, their cargos stolen.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" interrupted Chip shrewdly. \"How do you know about her\nif the crews have been murdered?\"\n  \n \n  \"She has a habit of locking the controls,\" explained Haldane, \"and\nsetting ravaged ships adrift. Apparently there is no room on her\nhideout\u2014wherever it is\u2014for empty hulks. One of these ships was\nsalvaged by a courageous cabin-boy who hid from the Lorelei and her\npirate band beneath a closetful of soiled linens in the laundry. He\ndescribed her. His description goes perfectly with less accurate\nglimpses seen over the visiphones of several score spacecraft!\"\n  \n \n  Chip said soberly, \"So it's no joke, eh, pal? Sorry I popped off. I\nthought you were pulling my leg. Where do\n   \n   I\n   \n  come into this mess,\nthough?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ekalastron!\" grunted Johnny succinctly. \"A jackpot prize for any\ncorsair! And you\n   \n   advertised\n   \n  a cargo of it over the etherwaves! The\nLorelei will be waiting for you with her tongue hanging out. The only\nthing for you to do, kid, is go back to Jupiter or Io as fast as you\ncan get there. Make the Patrol give you a convoy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A sudden light danced in Chip Warren's eyes. It was a light Syd Palmer\nwould have groaned to see\u2014for it usually presaged trouble. It was a\nbright, hard, reckless light.\n  \n \n  \"Hold your jets, Johnny!\" drawled Chip. \"Aren't you forgetting one\nthing? In a couple more hours, I can face the Lorelei and her whole\nmob\u2014and be damned to them! She can't touch the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  , because\nit's being plated right now!\"\n  \n \n  Haldane snapped his fingers in quick remembrance.\n  \n \n  \"By thunder, you're right! Her shells will ricochet off the\n   \n   Chickadee's\n   \n  hull like hail off a tin roof. Chip, are you in any hurry\nto reach Earth? I thought not. What do you say we go after the Lorelei\n   \n   together\n   \n  ! I'll swear you in as a Deputy Patrolman; we'll take the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a deal!\" declared Chip promptly. \"You got any idea where this\nLorelei's hangout is?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's why I'm here on Danae. I got a tip that one of the Lorelei's\nmen put in here for supplies. I hoped maybe I could single him\nout somehow, follow him when he jetted for his base, and in that\nway\u2014\n   \n   Chip! Look out!\n   \n  \"\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief.

He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it.

He must remember that!\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Somebody said, \"Doctor!\"\n  \n \n  He wanted to say, \"Yes, get a doctor. Lorelei\u2014\" but his mouth only\ntwitched feebly. He couldn't seem to get it to work properly.\n  \n \n  He tried again. \"Doctor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" A gentle, masculine voice.\n  \n \n  He opened his eyes with an effort. There was a blurred face before him;\nin a moment it grew clearer. The strong, clean-shaven chin contrasted\noddly with the haggard circles under the eyes. There was a clean,\nstarched odor.\n  \n \n  \"Where am I?\" he said. He tried to turn his head, but a firm hand\npressed him back into the sheets.\n  \n \n  \"You're in a hospital. Just lie quietly, please.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to get up again. \"Where's Lorelei?\"\n  \n \n  \"She's well, and you'll see her soon. Now lie quietly. You've been a\nvery sick man.\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in the bed. The room was coming into focus. He looked\naround him slowly. He felt very weak, but perfectly lucid.\n  \n \n  \"Yes....\" he said. \"How long have I been here, Doctor?\"\n  \n \n  The man hesitated, looked at him intently. \"Three months,\" he said. He\nturned and gave low-voiced instructions to a nurse, and then went away.\n  \n \n  Peter's head began spinning just a little. Glass clinked from a metal\nstand near his head; the nurse bent over him with a glass half full of\nmilky fluid. It tasted awful, but she made him drink it all.\n  \n \n  In a moment he began to relax, and the room got fuzzy again. Just\nbefore he drifted off, he said sleepily, \"You can't\u2014fool me. It's been\n   \n   more\n   \n  \u2014than three\u2014months.\"\n  \n \n  He was right. All the nurses, and even Dr. Arnold, were evasive, but he\nkept asking them why he couldn't see Lorelei, and finally he wormed it\nout of them. It had been nine and a half months, not three, and he'd\nbeen in a coma all that time. Lorelei, it seemed, had recovered much\nsooner.\n  \n \n  \"She was only suffering from ordinary shock,\" Arnold explained.\n\"Seeing that assistant of hers\u2014it was enough to knock anybody out,\nespecially a woman. But you stood actual mental contact with\n   \n   them\n   \n  for approximately five minutes. Yes, we know\u2014you talked a lot. It's a\nmiracle you're alive, and rational.\"\n  \n \n  \"But where is she?\" Peter complained. \"You still haven't explained why\nI haven't been able to see her.\"\n  \n \n  Arnold frowned. \"All right,\" he said. \"I guess you're strong enough to\ntake it. She's underground, with the rest of the women and children,\nand a good two-thirds of the male population. That's where you'll go,\nas soon as you're well enough to be moved. We started digging in six\nmonths ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Peter whispered.\n  \n \n  Arnold's strong jaw knotted. \"We're hiding,\" he said. \"Everything else\nhas failed.\"\n  \n \n  Peter couldn't think of anything to say. Dr. Arnold's voice went on\nafter a moment, musingly. \"We're burrowing into the earth, like worms.\nIt didn't take us long to find out we couldn't kill them. They didn't\neven take any notice of our attempts to do so, except once. That was\nwhen a squadron of the Police caught about fifty of them together at\none time, and attacked with flame guns and a new secret weapon. It\ndidn't hurt them, but it annoyed them. It was the first time they'd\nbeen annoyed, I think. They blew up half a state, and it's still\nsmoldering.\"\n  \n \n  \"And since then?\" Peter asked huskily.\n  \n \n  \"Since then, we've been burrowing. All the big cities.... It would be\nan impossible task if we tried to include all the thinly-populated\nareas, of course, but it doesn't matter. By the time we excavate\nenough to take care of a quarter of the earth's population, the other\nthree-quarters will be dead, or worse.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wonder,\" Peter said shakily, \"if I am strong enough to take it.\"\n  \n \n  Arnold laughed harshly. \"You are. You've got to be. You're part of our\nlast hope, you see.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our last hope?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. You're a scientist.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see,\" said Peter. And for the first time, he thought of the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  . No plan leaped full-born into his mind, but,\n   \n   maybe\n   \n  , he\nthought,\n   \n   there's a chance\n   \n  ....\n  \n"

He didn't like it. Not a bit! It was too\u2014too\u2014\n  \n \n  He turned away angrily, ripped the offending article from about his\nneck, and chose another necktie from the rack. This one was brighter,\ngaudier, much more in keeping with the gaiety of his mood. He emitted a\ngrunt of satisfaction, spun from the mirror to face his two companions\ntriumphantly.\n  \n \n  \"There! How do you like\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always\nlanguid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem\nconcerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned\ninsultingly and forced a shudder.\n  \n \n  \"Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!\"\n  \n \n  \"You,\" Chip told him serenely, \"have no appreciation of beauty. What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think of it, Padre?\"\n  \n \n  \"Salvation\" Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black,\na lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his\nweathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. \"Well,\nmy boy,\" he admitted, \"there is\n   \n   some\n   \n  Biblical precedent for\nyour\u2014ahem!\u2014clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coat\nwhich was of many colors\u2014'\"\n  \n \n  \"Both of you,\" declared Chip, \"give me a pain in the pants!\nStick-in-the-muds! Here we are in port for the first time in months,\ncargo-bins loaded to the gunwales with enough ekalastron to make us\nrich for life\u2014and you sit here like a pair of stuffed owls!\n  \n \n  \"Well, not me!

But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-joint\nentertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer!\"\n  \n \n  Salvation said soberly, \"Syd's just fooling, my boy. But I\n   \n   would\n   \n  be\ncareful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law\nand order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as\nwell as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent\nand unheeding the words of Him who rules all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that\nSalvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who\nespoused the principle of \"turning the other cheek\" to evildoers.\nSalvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n  \n \n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation\nacknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be\nthe best hand with a gun!\n  \n \n  Now Chip gave quiet answer. \"I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well,\nSyd\u2014sure you won't change your mind and come along?\"\n  \n \n  \"No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this\njalopy with ek. Got to stay and watch 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. I'm off alone, then.

She was tall and tanned, like him; had a few freckles,\nlike him; and wavy red hair, like his. She ignored the brightly\nhumorous blue eyes.\n  \n \n  \"In other words,\" she said, \"everyone on the planet looks like you and\nme?\"\n  \n \n  Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin.\n\"Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think\nthat people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit\nso many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I\nsuppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside\ndown!\" He laughed and sobered. \"But then why wear spacesuits? The air\nis breathable.\"\n  \n \n  \"For safety,\" June told him. \"We can't take any chances on plague.\"\n  \n \n  Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons, and the\nwind ruffled his hair. He looked comfortable, and they longed to take\noff the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins.\nMinos was like home, like Earth.... But they were strangers.\n  \n \n  \"Plague,\" Pat Mead said thoughtfully. \"We had one here. It came two\nyears after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead\nfamilies. They were immune. I guess we look alike because we're all\nrelated, and that's why I grew up thinking that it is the only way\npeople can look.\"\n  \n \n \n   Plague.\n   \n  \"What was the disease?\" Hal Barton asked.\n  \n \n  \"Pretty gruesome, according to my father. They called it the melting\nsickness. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to\ndo about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have trained for more doctors, or sent to civilization for\nsome.\" A trace of impatience was in George Barton's voice.\n  \n \n  Pat Mead explained patiently, \"Our ship, with the power plant and all\nthe books we needed, went off into the sky to avoid the contagion,\nand never came back. The crew must have died.\" Long years of hardship\nwere indicated by that statement, a colony with electric power gone\nand machinery stilled, with key technicians dead and no way to replace\nthem. June realized then the full meaning of the primitive sheath knife\nand bow.\n  \n \n  \"Any recurrence of melting sickness?\" asked Hal Barton.\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other diseases?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a one.\"\n  \n \n  Max was eyeing the bronze red-headed figure with something approaching\nawe. \"Do you think all the Meads look like that?\" he said to June on\nthe intercom. \"I wouldn't mind being a Mead myself!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"May I go aboard?\" Pat asked hopefully.\n  \n \n  Max unslung the specimen kit from his shoulder, laid it on the carpet\nof plants that covered the ground and began to open it.\n  \n \n  \"Tests first,\" Hal Barton said. \"We have to find out if you people\nstill carry this so-called melting sickness. We'll have to de-microbe\nyou and take specimens before we let you on board. Once on, you'll be\nno good as a check for what the other Meads might have.\"\n  \n \n  Max was taking out a rack and a stand of preservative bottles and\nhypodermics.\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to jab me with those?\" Pat asked with interest.\n  \n \n  \"You're just a specimen animal to me, bud!\" Max grinned at Pat Mead,\nand Pat grinned back. June saw that they were friends already, the\ntall pantherish colonist, and the wry, black-haired doctor. She felt a\nstab of guilt because she loved Max and yet could pity him for being\nsmaller and frailer than Pat Mead.\n  \n \n  \"Lie down,\" Max told him, \"and hold still. We need two spinal fluid\nsamples from the back, a body cavity one in front, and another from the\narm.\"\n  \n \n  Pat lay down obediently. Max knelt, and, as he spoke, expertly swabbed\nand inserted needles with the smooth speed that had made him a fine\nnerve surgeon on Earth.\n  \n \n  High above them the scout helioplane came out of an opening in the ship\nand angled off toward the west, its buzz diminishing. Then, suddenly,\nit veered and headed back, and Reno Unrich's voice came tinnily from\ntheir earphones:\n  \n \n  \"What's that you've got? Hey, what are you docs doing down there?\" He\nbanked again and came to a stop, hovering fifty feet away. June could\nsee his startled face looking through the glass at Pat.\n  \n \n  Hal Barton switched to a narrow radio beam, explained rapidly and\npointed in the direction of Alexandria. Reno's plane lifted and flew\naway over the odd-colored forest.\n  \n \n  \"The plane will drop a note on your town, telling them you got\nthrough to us,\" Hal Barton told Pat, who was sitting up watching Max\ndexterously put the blood and spinal fluids into the right bottles\nwithout exposing them to air.\n  \n \n  \"We won't be free to contact your people until we know if they still\ncarry melting sickness,\" Max added. \"You might be immune so it doesn't\nshow on you, but still carry enough germs\u2014if that's what caused it\u2014to\nwipe out a planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you do carry melting sickness,\" said Hal Barton, \"we won't be able\nto mingle with your people until we've cleared them of the disease.\"\n  \n \n  \"Starting with me?\" Pat asked.\n  \n \n  \"Starting with you,\" Max told him ruefully, \"as soon as you step on\nboard.\"\n  \n \n  \"More needles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, and a few little extras thrown in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rough?\"\n  \n \n  \"It isn't easy.\"\n  \n \n  A few minutes later, standing in the stalls for spacesuit\ndecontamination, being buffeted by jets of hot disinfectant, bathed in\nglares of sterilizing ultraviolet radiation, June remembered that and\ncompared Pat Mead's treatment to theirs.\n  \n \n  In the\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  , stored carefully in sealed tanks and containers,\nwas the ultimate, multi-purpose cureall. It was a solution of enzymes\nso like the key catalysts of the human cell nucleus that it caused\nchemical derangement and disintegration in any non-human cell. Nothing\ncould live in contact with it but human cells; any alien intruder to\nthe body would die. Nucleocat Cureall was its trade name.\n  \n \n  But the cureall alone was not enough for complete safety. Plagues had\nbeen known to slay too rapidly and universally to be checked by human\ntreatment. Doctors are not reliable; they die. Therefore spaceways and\ninterplanetary health law demanded that ship equipment for guarding\nagainst disease be totally mechanical in operation, rapid and efficient.\n  \n \n  Somewhere near them, in a series of stalls which led around and\naround like a rabbit maze, Pat was being herded from stall to stall\nby peremptory mechanical voices, directed to soap and shower, ordered\nto insert his arm into a slot which took a sample of his blood, given\nsolutions to drink, bathed in germicidal ultraviolet, shaken by sonic\nblasts, breathing air thick with sprays of germicidal mists, being\ndirected to put his arms into other slots where they were anesthesized\nand injected with various immunizing solutions.\n  \n \n  Finally, he would be put in a room of high temperature and extreme\ndryness, and instructed to sit for half an hour while more fluids were\ndripped into his veins through long thin tubes.\n  \n \n  All legal spaceships were built for safety. No chance was taken of\nallowing a suspected carrier to bring an infection on board with him.\n  \n"

        "He was so smug and so sure, this snowbird. I hated him. Because I\ncouldn't trust to my own senses as he did.\n  \n \n  \"You don't exist,\" I said slowly, painfully. \"You are fictional\ncreations.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor flushed darkly. \"You give my literary agent too much credit\nfor the addition of professional polish to my works.\"\n  \n \n  The other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that\nlooked vaguely like an ice-skate. \"Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor\nwould tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory\nand practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better\nequipped to judge whether we exist.\"\n  \n \n  There was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had\never heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception\nto Relativity and the positron and negatron.\n  \n \n  \"Interesting.\" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke.\n\"Presume that the people of your time by their 'Extra-sensory\nPerception' have altered the past to make it as they suppose it to be.\nThe great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we\nknow them. The great literary creations assume reality.\"\n  \n \n  I thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be\nthe goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed\nredhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the\ndetective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of\nunknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.\n  \n \n  His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal\nsymptoms.\"\n  \n \n  The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building\nup behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He\nwas not\n   \n   really\n   \n  a snowbird.\n  \n \n  After a time, I asked the doctor a question.\n  \n \n  \"Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my\nprofessional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Accepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great\nand good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened.\nMy heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote\nin sunlight and stepped toward it....\n  \n \n  ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.\n  \n<doc-sep>For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,\nclosed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.\n  \n \n  \"My last book,\n   \n   Death In The Atom\n   \n  , hit the stands last January,\"\nshe began. \"When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'\nvacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.\nWell, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so\nfor this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six\nweeks in-country.

To make a long story short, I got him talking about\nhis adventures, and he told me plenty.\"\n  \n \n  The old woman paused. \"Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Some new kind of ...\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not a new kind of anything.

Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of\nintolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,\na thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.\"\n  \n \n  I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.\n  \n \n  \"Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three\nplanets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage.

A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and\u2014. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers\u2014Aspen, Taos and college towns\u2014thousands of\npeople sick\u2014but none in that valley in Tennessee\u2014and few government\nworkers\u2014just one girl in his office\u2014and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter\u2014and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n  \n"

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n"

Some\nscientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and\nthat the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but\never-present eternity.

Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\nhis ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?\nPlease get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\ndone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\ntell him it was all right.

        "Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Emmer smiled, unsheathing great teeth. \"You've never seen any pictures?\nImpressive, but just a camp, monolithic one-story structures, and\nwe'd give something to know what they're made of. Presumably my world\nwas one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing\nit, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\nstructures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\nforty feet high.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\nimpressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\nnot a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\na route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\nthousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n  \n \n  \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\nours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\nthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\nthey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\nnever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\nlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\nPerhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\nthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n  \n \n  \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\noften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\ndon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\nadvanced in civilization.

Sim eyed the\n   \n  Ship\u2014if he only dared reach it and\n   \n  escape! ... but it was more than half an\n   \n  hour distant\u2014the limit of life itself!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1946.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  During the night, Sim was born. He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.\n  \n"

Is the most callous\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\n  \n \n  Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\nhe reached the village.\n  \n \n  He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\n  \n \n  He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n  \n \n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n  \n \n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n  \n \n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n  \n \n  \"What happened here?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\nthey're gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you stayed here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To die,\" the old man said, without self-pity. \"I'm too old to flee, too\nold to fight, too old for anything but death.

You're in your room, sleeping,\nand the house is silent.\n  \n \n  It's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\nwriting this.\n  \n \n  I looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\n  \n \n  And among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\n  \n \n  A wedding ring.\n  \n \n  In that past he never talked about, there was a woman\u2014his wife.\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\u2014that there can be\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\n  \n \n  Do you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate?

Yet how could one\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\n  \n \n  Charlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\n  \n \n  Because of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\n  \n \n  Right now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\non Mars, the\n   \n   Space Rat\n   \n  , just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach.

        "Three days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.\n  \n \n  The caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day.\nTheir water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to\nreach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\nbacks.\n  \n \n  And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\nSteve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the\nturbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but\nhad assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had\ndone so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" someone asked. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the\nday before said: \"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money\u2014with the\nKumaji.\"\n  \n \n  None of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying\nanything, and Steve squeezed her hand.\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute,\" one of Whiting's friends said.\n  \n \n  \"Wait, nothing.\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the\ncolony. \"I know how Whiting's mind works.

Cantwell, didn't you say the\nKumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I was told,\" Steve said.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Gort went on relentlessly. \"Then this is what I figure must\nhave happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally\ndecided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's\n'copter, determined to get it.

Steve\ncouldn't release his throat to grab the pike. The guard stabbed out\nawkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned,\nbut Steve hardly heard him.\n  \n \n  When the guard's legs stopped drumming, Steve released him. The man was\neither dead or so close to death that he would be out for hours.

Dad was\u2014hit. The pike, a wild stab. He's hit bad\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Steve crawled over to them. It was very dark. He could barely make out\nTobias Whiting's pain-contorted face.\n  \n \n  \"My stomach,\" Whiting said, gasping for breath. \"The pain....\"\n  \n \n  Steve probed with his hands, found the wound. Blood was rushing out. He\ncouldn't stop it and he knew it and he thought Whiting knew it too. He\ntouched Mary's hand, and held it. Mary sobbed against him, crying\nsoftly.\n  \n \n  \"You two ...\" Whiting gasped. \"You two ... Mary, Mary girl. Is\u2014he\u2014what\nyou want?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Dad. Oh, yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"You can get her out of here, Cantwell?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so,\" Steve said.\n  \n \n  \"Then go. Go while you can. I'll tell them\u2014due south. The Earthmen are\nheading due south. They'll go\u2014south. They won't find the caravan.\nYou'll\u2014all\u2014get away. If it's\u2014what you want, Mary.\"\n  \n \n  She leaned away from Steve, kissing her father. She asked Steve: \"Isn't\nthere anything we can do for him?\"\n  \n \n  Steve shook his head. \"But he's got to live long enough to tell them, to\ndeceive them.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll live long enough,\" Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he\nwould. \"Luck to\u2014all of you. From a\u2014very foolish\u2014man....\"\n  \n"

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The chance of mass slaughter was their eternal nightmare.\n  \n \n \n  How black is the blackest treachery? Is the most callous\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\n  \n \n  Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\nhe reached the village.\n  \n \n  He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\n  \n \n  He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n  \n \n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n  \n \n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n  \n \n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n  \n \n  \"What happened here?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\nthey're gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you stayed here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To die,\" the old man said, without self-pity. \"I'm too old to flee, too\nold to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Kapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines\nof his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered\nwith mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.\n  \n \n  He said thickly, \"I found it. I said I'd do it, and I did. I found it\nand brought it out.\"\n  \n \n  The cigarette stub fell out of his mouth. He didn't notice it. \"Help\nme,\" he said simply. \"I'm scared.\" His mouth drooled.\n  \n \n  \"I got it hidden. They want to find out, but I won't tell 'em. It's\ngot to go back. Back where I found it. I tried to take it, but they\nwouldn't let me, and I was afraid they'd find it....\"\n  \n \n  He reached suddenly and grabbed the edge of the table. \"I don't know\nhow they found out about it, but they did. I've got to get it back.\nI've got to....\"\n  \n \n  Bucky looked at me. Kapper was blue around the mouth. I was scared,\nsuddenly. I said, \"Get what back where?\"\n  \n \n  Bucky got up. \"I'll get a doctor,\" he said. \"Stick with him.\" Kapper\ngrabbed his wrist. Kapper's nails were blue and the cords in his hands\nstood out like guy wires.\n  \n \n  \"Don't leave me. Got to tell you\u2014where it is. Got to take it back.\nPromise you'll take it back.\" He gasped and struggled over his\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Bucky. \"Sure, well take it back. What is it?\"\n  \n \n  Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for\nair. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no\nuse. Kapper whispered,\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Cansin\n   \n  . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is it, Sam?\"\n  \n \n  I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish\nwas standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper\nmade a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.\n  \n \n  Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt\nKapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.\n  \n \n  \"Heart?\" said Beamish finally.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Bucky. He looked as bad as I felt. \"Poor Sam.\"\n  \n \n  I looked at the cigarette stub smoldering on the table. I looked at\nBeamish with his round dead baby face. I climbed over Shannon and\npushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.\n  \n \n  \"Keep this guy here till I get back,\" I said.\n  \n \n  Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. \"Shut up,\" I\ntold him. \"We got a contract.\" I yanked the curtains shut and walked\nover to the bar.\n  \n \n  I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the\nplace. At first glance they looked okay\u2014a hard-faced, muscular bunch\nof miners in dirty shirts and high boots.\n  \n \n  Then I looked at their hands. They were dirty enough. But they never\ndid any work in a mine, on Venus or anywhere else.\n  \n \n  The place was awfully quiet, for that kind of a place. The bartender\nwas a big pot-bellied swamp-edger with pale eyes and thick white hair\ncoiled up on top of his bullet head. He was not happy.\n  \n \n  I leaned on the bar. \"\n   \n   Lhak\n   \n  ,\" I said. He poured it, sullenly, out of a\ngreen bottle. I reached for it, casually.\n  \n \n  \"That guy we brought in,\" I said. \"He sure has a skinful. Passed out\ncold. What's he been spiking his drinks with?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Selak\n   \n  ,\" said a voice in my ear. \"As if you didn't know.\"\n  \n \n  I turned. The man who had given Kapper the cigarette was standing\nbehind me. And I remembered him, then.\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  He\n  took a walk.\n  \n \n  The town was just coming\nto life. People were strolling\nout of their houses, commenting\non the weather, chuckling\namiably about local affairs.\nKids on bicycles were beginning\nto appear, jangling the\nlittle bells and hooting to\neach other. A woman, hanging\nwash in the back yard,\ncalled out to him, thinking\nhe was somebody else.\n  \n \n  He found a little park, no\nmore than twenty yards in\ncircumference, centered\naround a weatherbeaten monument\nof some unrecognizable\nmilitary figure. Three\nold men took their places on\nthe bench that circled the\nGeneral, and leaned on their\ncanes.\n  \n \n  Sol was a civil engineer.\nBut he made like a reporter.\n  \n \n  \"Pardon me, sir.\" The old\nman, leathery-faced, with a\nfine yellow moustache, looked\nat him dumbly. \"Have you\never heard of Armagon?\"\n  \n \n  \"You a stranger?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thought so.\"\n  \n \n  Sol repeated the question.\n  \n \n  \"Course I did. Been goin'\nthere ever since I was a kid.\nNight-times, that is.\"\n  \n \n  \"How\u2014I mean, what kind\nof place is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Said you're a stranger?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then 'tain't your business.\"\n  \n \n  That was that.\n  \n \n  He left the park, and wandered\ninto a thriving luncheonette.\nHe tried questioning\nthe man behind the counter,\nwho merely snickered and\nsaid: \"You stayin' with the\nDawes, ain't you? Better ask\nWillie, then. He knows the\nplace better than anybody.\"\n  \n \n  He asked about the execution,\nand the man stiffened.\n  \n \n  \"Don't think I can talk\nabout that. Fella broke one of\nthe Laws; that's about it.\nDon't see where you come\ninto it.\"\n  \n \n  At eleven o'clock, he returned\nto the Dawes residence,\nand found Mom in the\nkitchen, surrounded by the\nwarm nostalgic odor of home-baked\nbread. She told him\nthat her husband had left a\nmessage for the stranger, informing\nhim that the State\nPolice would be around to get\nhis story.\n  \n \n  He waited in the house,\ngloomily turning the pages of\nthe local newspaper, searching\nfor references to Armagon.\nHe found nothing.\n  \n \n  At eleven-thirty, a brown-faced\nState Trooper came to\ncall, and Sol told his story.\nHe was promised nothing,\nand told to stay in town until\nhe was contacted again by\nthe authorities.\n  \n \n  Mom fixed him a light\nlunch, the greatest feature of\nwhich was some hot biscuits\nshe plucked out of the oven.\nIt made him feel almost normal.\n  \n \n  He wandered around the\ntown some more after lunch,\ntrying to spark conversation\nwith the residents.\n  \n \n  He learned little.\n "

        "Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\"\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n  \n \n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City,\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\n  \n \n  \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n   \n   thlot's\n   \n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n  \n \n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n  \n \n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\nmake a mistake, can't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\"\n  \n \n  Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\nreach Oasis City in safety.\n  \n \n  With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\n  \n<doc-sep>Three days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.\n  \n \n  The caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day.\nTheir water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to\nreach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\nbacks.\n  \n \n  And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\nSteve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the\nturbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but\nhad assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had\ndone so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" someone asked. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the\nday before said: \"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money\u2014with the\nKumaji.\"\n  \n \n  None of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying\nanything, and Steve squeezed her hand.\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute,\" one of Whiting's friends said.\n  \n \n  \"Wait, nothing.\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the\ncolony. \"I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for\nthat money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the\nKumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I was told,\" Steve said.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Gort went on relentlessly. \"Then this is what I figure must\nhave happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally\ndecided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's\n'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the\nKumaji, they won't just give it to him\u2014not by a long sight.\"\n  \n \n  \"No?\" someone asked.\n  \n \n  \"No sir. They'll trade. For our location. And if Whiting went off like\nthat without even saying good-bye to his girl here, my guess is he'll\nmake the trade.\" His voice reflected some bitterness.\n  \n"

        "The native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\n  \n \n  The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n  \n \n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why? Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am keeper of the city.\"\n  \n \n  \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits may return.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave!\"\n  \n \n  The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\n  \n \n  He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You are sensitive,\" the native said in his ear. \"It takes a sensitive\ngod to feel the spirits moving in the houses and walking in these old\nstreets.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say it any way you want to. This is the most fascinating thing\nI've ever seen. The Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, Egyptian\ntombs\u2014none can hold a candle to this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod....\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't call me that. I'm not a god, and you know it.\"\n  \n \n  The old man shrugged. \"It is not an item worthy of dispute. Those names\nyou mention, are they the names of gods?\"\n  \n \n  He chuckled. \"In a way, yes. What is your name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maota.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must help me, Maota. These things must be preserved. We'll build\na museum, right here in the street. No, over there on the hill just\noutside the city. We'll collect all the old writings and perhaps we may\ndecipher them. Think of it, Maota! To read pages written so long ago\nand think their thoughts. We'll put everything under glass. Build and\nevacuate chambers to stop the decay. Catalogue, itemize....\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson was warming up to his subject, but Maota shook his head like\na waving palm frond and stamped his feet.\n  \n \n  \"You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't you see? Look at the decay. These things are priceless. They\nmust be preserved. Future generations will thank us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean,\" the old man asked, aghast, \"that you want others to come\nhere? You know the city abhors the sound of alien voices. Those who\nlived here may return one day! They must not find their city packaged\nand preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their\nfoul breaths upon. You will leave. Now!\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Michaelson was adamant. The rock of Gibraltar.\n  \n \n  Maota hit him, quickly, passionately, and dropped the weapon beside his\nbody. He turned swiftly, making a swirling mark in the sand with his\nheel, and walked off toward the hills outside the city.\n  \n \n  The weapon he had used was an ancient book. Its paper-thin pages\nrustled in the wind as if an unseen hand turned them, reading, while\nMichaelson's blood trickled out from the head wound upon the ancient\nstreet.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n"

What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>His entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to\na waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat.\nHe looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under\nthe night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the\nmoon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray.\n  \n \n  He put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised\ndamp fingers to his mouth. Salt.\n  \n \n  He stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly,\nuntil he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him,\nand shut his eyes and mind to everything.\n  \n \n  Much later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came\ndown on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to\nher, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they\nwere which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing\nhim again.\n  \n \n  It was getting light. His head was splitting.\n  \n \n  Davie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in\ntown....\n  \n \n \n   Town!\n   \n  He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east,\nto the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him\nright down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find\nout what was happening.\n  \n \n  He kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until\nshe broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs.\n  \n \n  Why hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately\u2014a long time\nlately?\n  \n \n \n   The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by\nflooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where\nthere could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where\nthat ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons.\nAnd after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of\nCrossville. And after that....\n   \n \n \n  He was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here\nhe was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could\nit be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to\nforget things he'd known all his life?\n  \n \n  He reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was\nbeyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on\nthe road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard.\nThere'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his\nfamily and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks\nheard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared. Then a man raised his\nvoice. \"Mistah, you breakin' regulations! Mistah, the police gonnah get\nyou!\"\n  \n"

        "\n  They\n  crossed the\nstreet diagonally, and entered\na two-story wooden building.\nDawes took the stairs at a\nbrisk pace, and pushed open\nthe door on the second floor.\nA fat man looked up from\nbehind a desk.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd\nsee if you wanted to help\nmove Brundage.\"\n  \n \n  The man batted his eyes.\n\"Oh, Brundage!\" he said.\n\"You know, I clean forgot\nabout him?\" He laughed.\n\"Imagine me forgetting\nthat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" Dawes wasn't\namused. \"And you Prince Regent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aw, Willie\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, come on.

He followed\nlamely behind the two men\nas they went out into the\nstreet again.\n  \n \n  A woman, with an empty\nmarket basket, nodded casually\nto them. \"Mornin', folks.\nEnjoyed it last night.\nThought you made a right\nnice speech, Mr. Dawes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Dawes answered\ngruffly, but obviously flattered.\n\"We were just goin'\nover to Brundage's to pick up\nthe body.

He's just too\ndern fat to do much more'n\nsit on a throne and eat grapes.\nThat right, Charlie?\"\n  \n \n  The fat man giggled.\n  \n \n  \"Here's the Sheriff,\" Dawes\nsaid.\n  \n \n  The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed\ncitizen with a long, sad face,\nwas rocking on a porch as\nthey approached his house,\ntrying to puff a half-lit pipe.\nHe lifted one hand wearily\nwhen he saw them.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Cookie,\" Dawes\ngrinned. \"Thought you, me,\nand Charlie would get Brundage's\nbody outa the house.\nThis here's Mr. Becker; he\ngot another problem. Mr.\nBecker, meet Cookie Coogan.\"\n  \n \n  The Sheriff joined the procession,\npausing only once to\ninquire into Sol's predicament.\n  \n \n  He described the hitchhiker\nincident, but Coogan\nlistened stoically. He murmured\nsomething about the\nTroopers, and shuffled alongside\nthe puffing fat man.\n  \n \n  Sol soon realized that their\ndestination was a barber shop.\n  \n \n  Dawes cupped his hands\nover the plate glass and\npeered inside. Gold letters on\nthe glass advertised: HAIRCUT\nSHAVE & MASSAGE\nPARLOR. He reported: \"Nobody\nin the shop. Must be\nupstairs.\"\n <doc-sep>\n  Mr. Dawes\n  came home an\nhour later, looking tired.\nMom pecked him lightly on\nthe forehead. He glanced at\nthe evening paper, and then\nspoke to Sol.\n  \n \n  \"Hear you been asking\nquestions, Mr. Becker.\"\n  \n \n  Sol nodded, embarrassed.\n\"Guess I have. I'm awfully\ncurious about this Armagon\nplace. Never heard of anything\nlike it before.\"\n  \n \n  Dawes grunted. \"You ain't\na reporter?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I\nwas just satisfying my own\ncuriosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh.\" Dawes looked\nreflective. \"You wouldn't be\nthinkin' about writing us up\nor anything. I mean, this is a\npretty private affair.\"\n  \n \n  \"Writing it up?\" Sol\nblinked. \"I hadn't thought of\nit. But you'll have to admit\u2014it's\nsure interesting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Dawes said narrowly.\n\"I guess it would be.\"\n  \n \n  \"Supper!\" Mom called.\n  \n \n  After the meal, they spent\na quiet evening at home. Sally\nwent to bed, screaming her\nreluctance, at eight-thirty.\nMom, dozing in the big chair\nnear the fireplace, padded upstairs\nat nine. Then Dawes\nyawned widely, stood up, and\nsaid goodnight at quarter-of-ten.\n  \n \n  He paused in the doorway\nbefore leaving.\n  \n \n  \"I'd think about that,\" he\nsaid. \"Writing it up, I mean.\nA lot of folks would think\nyou were just plum crazy.\"\n  \n \n  Sol laughed feebly. \"I\nguess they would at that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Goodnight,\" Dawes said.\n  \n \n  \"Goodnight.\"\n  \n \n  He read Sally's copy of\n   \n   Treasure Island\n   \n  for about\nhalf an hour.

The troublesome\nSally. The strange dream\nworld of Armagon. The visit\nto the barber shop. The removal\nof Brundage's body.\nThe conversations with the\ntownspeople. Dawes' suspicious\nattitude ...\n  \n \n  Then sleep came.\n <doc-sep>\n  At\n  the table, Dawes\nasked his destination.\n  \n \n  \"Wedding in Salinas,\" he\nexplained. \"Old Army friend\nof mine.

He opened\nhis mouth, but couldn't think\nof the right question to ask.\nThen he blurted out: \"What\nexecution?\"\n  \n \n  \"None of\n   \n   your\n   \n  business,\"\nthe man said coldly. \"You eat\nup, young man. If you want\nme to get Sheriff Coogan\nlookin' for your car.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the meal went\nsilently, except for Sally's insistence\nupon singing her\nschool song between mouthfuls.\nWhen Dawes was\nthrough, he pushed back his\nplate and ordered Sol to get\nready.\n  \n \n  Sol grabbed his topcoat and\nfollowed the man out the\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"Have to stop someplace\nfirst,\" Dawes said. \"But we'll\nbe pickin' up the Sheriff on\nthe way.

A few minutes after the professor's arrival,\nMrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew\nwhy and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their\nconversation to the professor.\n  \n \n  Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more\nimportant papers delivered at the conferences.

That'd be far beyond us.\"\n  \n \n  \"What about identical twins?\" Kesserich pointed out. \"And then there's\nparthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the\nmother without the intervention of the male.\" Although his voice had\ngrown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling\nsecretly. \"There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say\nnothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce\nwith no more stimulus than a salt solution.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. \"Even then you wouldn't get\nexactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if the parent were of very pure stock?

Newman tells about a pair of identical\ntwins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met\nby accident when they were twenty-one.

But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of\nthem had exactly the same experiences at the same times....\"\n  \n \n  For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,\nbecoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's\nsphinx-like face.\n  \n \n  \"Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,\"\nthe biologist said, all brisk again.

The wonder was that Ego Prime,\nInc., ever got to put their product on the market at all, once the\nnation's housewives got wind of just what their product was.\n  \n \n  From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the\nuse of Primes right down to the local level. You could get a license\nfor a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive, or a\nhigh public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but even\nthen his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to\nhave a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance\nexactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how,\nwhy, and under what circumstances.\n  \n \n  The law didn't leave a man much leeway.\n  \n \n  But everybody knew that if you\n   \n   really\n   \n  wanted a personal Prime with\nall his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one.

His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened.

Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n  \n<doc-sep>His friends came to life.

Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n \n \n \n   He was something out of a nightmare but his music was straight\nfrom heaven. He was a ragged little man out of a hole but he\nwas money in the bank to Stanley's four-piece combo. He was\n   \n  \u2014whoops!...\n  \n \n \n \n  The Holes and John Smith\n  \n \n  By Edward W. Ludwig\n  \n \n \n \n  Illustration by Kelly Freas\n  \n<doc-sep>It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,\nbecause I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me\nunhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.\nPlanets make me feel wretched.\n  \n \n  The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and\ncalves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on\na piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere\nand little grubby things just looking for\n   \n   you\n   \n  to crawl on. If you\ncan think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty\nimagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells\u2014I've\nbeen on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but\nnot for me.\n  \n \n  We have a place in the Ship like that\u2014the Third Level\u2014but it's only a\nthousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up\na level or down a level and be back in civilization.\n  \n \n  When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the\nsea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested\nhills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They\ndon't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his\ngear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still\nsmarting from the slap I'd given him.\n  \n \n  In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see\nJimmy\u2014if he would get back alive.\n  \n \n  It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the\nnearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound\nlike fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\n  \n \n  Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow\nfor fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They\ndo figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time\nyou're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to\nthe Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship\nis a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that\nsomething has to be done in a closed society to keep the population\nfrom decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to\nkeep the population steady.\n  \n \n  I began to check my gear out\u2014sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be\nfound at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.\nVenie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start\ngetting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next\nlanding, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't\nhave anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the\nbad moment any longer.\n  \n \n  The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,\nand in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the\ncolor of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the\nlights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in\nthe dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach\nif it's really going to come back. But I lived through it\u2014one day in\nthirty gone.\n  \n \n  I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three\nthings in mind\u2014stay alive, find people and find some of the others.\nThe first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot\nI could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to\ncamp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,\nthough not with that meatball Jimmy D.\n  \n \n  No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take\nnothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from\nnobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\n  \n \n  I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November\u2014too close to\nYear End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was\nspring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got\nback we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to\nlook forward to.\n  \n \n  In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking\nanimals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty\ngood, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the\nbest meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I\nwondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and\nthey've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good\nthat I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\n  \n \n  On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the\nhillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching\nit in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a\nhard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks\nof horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't\nidentify.\n  \n \n  One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when\nthey dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the\nactual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on\nEarth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were\nestablished, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have\ndraft animals.\n  \n \n  The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,\nas well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything\nelse in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies\nwere planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that\n   \n   could\n   \n  have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have\nhad to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll\nbet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses.\n  \n"

His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.\n  \n \n  His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. \"Withdrawal\nsymptoms.\"\n  \n \n  The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building\nup behind my hatred unbrinked.

Nothing happened.\nMy heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote\nin sunlight and stepped toward it....\n  \n \n  ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an\nhour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still\nfive more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck\nand shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout.\n  \n \n  After a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of\nBig Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a\nheavy drizzle now.\n  \n \n  Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest\nagainst one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots\nand a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with\na slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll\nover onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.\n  \n \n  The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.\n  \n \n  Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid\nground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside\nthe ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae,\nextending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded\ntemperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary\nconditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and\nall its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.\n  \n \n  Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide,\nsluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there,\nhe headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a\nhigher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw\nthem. As usual, most were swimming in the river.\n  \n \n \n \n  One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture\nof gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps\na lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his\ntoothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that\nmight have been a greeting\u2014or a warning to the others that a stranger\napproached.\n  \n \n  The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery\nbody of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms\nto his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in\nthree-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick,\nwith footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave\nhis legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish\nsmell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.\n  \n \n  The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling\nslightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm\nforward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main\ngroup.\n  \n"

How long had the stuff been coming through in this inane baby\ntalk? And why hadn't he noticed it before? Why had he had to read this\nlast communication a third time before he recognized anything unusual\nabout it?\n  \n \n  He went over the words again, as though maybe this time they'd read as\nthey should.\n  \n \n  OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS BETTER,\nLET USNS KNOW.\n  \n \n  SS II\n  \n \n  Kaiser let himself ease back in the pilot chair and rolled the tape\nthoughtfully between his fingers. Overhead and to each side, large\ndrops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scout\nship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground.\n  \n \n  \"Damn this climate!\" Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. \"Doesn't it ever do\nanything here except rain?\"\n  \n \n  His attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And\nwhy was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he been\ndoing during that time?\n  \n \n  Listlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture\nfrom his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone out\nwhen the scout ship cracked up. He'd have to repair the scout or he\nwas stuck here for good. He remembered now that he had gone over the\njob very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle\nalone\u2014or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little or\nno chance of his being able to find either here.\n  \n \n  Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and\nbrought them out where he could look at them:\n  \n \n  The mother ship,\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  , had been on the last leg of its\nplanet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scout\nship\u2014the other seven had all been lost one way or another during the\nexploring of new worlds\u2014and set itself into a giant orbit about this\nplanet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  had to maintain its constant speed; it had no means\nof slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop.\nIts limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an\norbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circle\na pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low.\n  \n \n  Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here\nforever.\n  \n \n  That was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing\nrecently.\n  \n \n  A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the\ntape in his hand.

Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

        " \n  Well, naturally Kaiser would transmit baby\n   \n  talk messages to his mother ship! He was\u2014\n  \n \n  GROWING UP ON BIG MUDDY\n  \n \n  By CHARLES V. DE VET\n  \n \n  Illustrated by TURPIN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Kaiser stared at the tape in his hand for a long uncomprehending\nminute. How long had the stuff been coming through in this inane baby\ntalk? And why hadn't he noticed it before? Why had he had to read this\nlast communication a third time before he recognized anything unusual\nabout it?\n  \n \n  He went over the words again, as though maybe this time they'd read as\nthey should.\n  \n \n  OO IS SICK, SMOKY. DO TO BEDDY-BY. KEEP UM WARM. WHEN UM FEELS BETTER,\nLET USNS KNOW.\n  \n \n  SS II\n  \n \n  Kaiser let himself ease back in the pilot chair and rolled the tape\nthoughtfully between his fingers. Overhead and to each side, large\ndrops of rain thudded softly against the transparent walls of the scout\nship and dripped wearily from the bottom ledge to the ground.\n  \n \n  \"Damn this climate!\" Kaiser muttered irrelevantly. \"Doesn't it ever do\nanything here except rain?\"\n  \n \n  His attention returned to the matter at hand. Why the baby talk? And\nwhy was his memory so hazy? How long had he been here? What had he been\ndoing during that time?\n  \n \n  Listlessly he reached for the towel at his elbow and wiped the moisture\nfrom his face and bare shoulders. The air conditioning had gone out\nwhen the scout ship cracked up. He'd have to repair the scout or he\nwas stuck here for good. He remembered now that he had gone over the\njob very carefully and thoroughly, and had found it too big to handle\nalone\u2014or without better equipment, at least. Yet there was little or\nno chance of his being able to find either here.\n  \n \n  Calmly, deliberately, Kaiser collected his thoughts, his memories, and\nbrought them out where he could look at them:\n  \n \n  The mother ship,\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  , had been on the last leg of its\nplanet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scout\nship\u2014the other seven had all been lost one way or another during the\nexploring of new worlds\u2014and set itself into a giant orbit about this\nplanet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Soscites II\n   \n  had to maintain its constant speed; it had no means\nof slowing, except to stop, and no way to start again once it did stop.\nIts limited range of maneuverability made it necessary to set up an\norbit that would take it approximately one month, Earth time, to circle\na pinpointed planet. And now its fuel was low.\n  \n \n  Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here\nforever.\n  \n \n  That was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing\nrecently.\n  \n \n  A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the\ntape in his hand. Baby talk....\n  \n<doc-sep>Kaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an\nhour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still\nfive more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck\nand shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout.\n  \n \n  After a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of\nBig Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a\nheavy drizzle now.\n  \n \n  Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest\nagainst one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots\nand a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with\na slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll\nover onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.\n  \n \n  The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.\n  \n \n  Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid\nground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside\nthe ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae,\nextending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded\ntemperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary\nconditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and\nall its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.\n  \n \n  Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide,\nsluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there,\nhe headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a\nhigher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw\nthem. As usual, most were swimming in the river.\n  \n \n \n \n  One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture\nof gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps\na lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his\ntoothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that\nmight have been a greeting\u2014or a warning to the others that a stranger\napproached.\n  \n \n  The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery\nbody of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms\nto his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in\nthree-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick,\nwith footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave\nhis legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish\nsmell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.\n  \n \n  The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling\nslightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm\nforward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main\ngroup.\n  \n<doc-sep>The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and\nwhen Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to\nthe village he had visited the day before. However, there were other\nseal-people here.\n  \n \n  And they were almost human!\n  \n \n  The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup\u2014that\nwas little changed from the first he had found\u2014as in their obviously\ngreater intelligence.\n  \n \n  This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.\nKaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he\nslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.\nWhere the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly\nalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these\nhad no odor\u2014only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet\nhim, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.\n  \n \n  Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes\nof curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.\n  \n \n  One was a female.\n  \n \n  They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he\nunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He\ntried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object,\nbut their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused\nhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was\nfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to\ncarry on a limited conversation.\n  \n \n  The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until\nKaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached\nthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.\n  \n"

        "\"Extrone wants to see you,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  Ri twisted at the grass shoot, broke it off, worried and unhappy.\n\"What's he want to see\n   \n   me\n   \n  for?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" Lin said curtly.\n  \n \n  Ri got to his feet. One of his hands reached out, plucked nervously\nat Lin's bare forearm. \"Look,\" he whispered. \"You know him. I have\u2014a\nlittle money. If you were able to ... if he wants,\" Ri gulped, \"to\n   \n   do\n   \n  anything to me\u2014I'd pay you, if you could....\"\n  \n \n  \"You better come along,\" Lin said, turning.\n  \n \n  Ri rubbed his hands along his thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound,\nineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to where\nExtrone was seated, petting his rifle.\n  \n \n  Extrone nodded genially. \"The farn beast hunter, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone drummed his fingers on the stock of the blast rifle. \"Tell me\nwhat they look like,\" he said suddenly.\n  \n \n  \"Well, sir, they're ... uh....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty frightening?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir.... Well, in a way, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\n   \n   you\n   \n  weren't afraid of them, were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir. No, because....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone was smiling innocently. \"Good. I want you to do something for\nme.\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I....\" Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his eye.\nLin's face was impassive.\n  \n \n  \"Of\n   \n   course\n   \n  you will,\" Extrone said genially. \"Get me a rope, Lin. A\ngood, long, strong rope.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are you going to do?\" Ri asked, terrified.\n  \n \n  \"Why, I'm going to tie the rope around your waist and stake you out as\nbait.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, come now. When the farn beast hears you scream\u2014you\n   \n   can\n   \n  scream,\nby the way?\"\n  \n \n  Ri swallowed.\n  \n \n  \"We could find a way to make you.\"\n  \n \n  There was perspiration trickling down Ri's forehead, a single drop,\ncreeping toward his nose.\n  \n \n  \"You'll be safe,\" Extrone said, studying his face with amusement. \"I'll\nshoot the animal before it reaches you.\"\n  \n \n  Ri gulped for air. \"But ... if there should be more than one?\"\n  \n \n  Extrone shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014Look, sir. Listen to me.\" Ri's lips were bloodless and his hands\nwere trembling. \"It's not me you want to do this to. It's Mia, sir.\n   \n   He\n   \n  killed a farn beast before\n   \n   I\n   \n  did, sir. And last night\u2014last\nnight, he\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"He what?\" Extrone demanded, leaning forward intently.\n  \n \n  Ri breathed with a gurgling sound. \"He said he ought to kill you, sir.\nThat's what he said. I heard him, sir. He said he ought to kill you.\nHe's the one you ought to use for bait. Then if there was an accident,\nsir, it wouldn't matter, because he said he ought to kill you. I\nwouldn't....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone said, \"Which one is he?\"\n  \n \n  \"That one. Right over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"The one with his back to me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. That's him. That's him, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone aimed carefully and fired, full charge, then lowered the rifle\nand said, \"Here comes Lin with the rope, I see.\"\n  \n \n  Ri was greenish. \"You ... you....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone turned to Lin. \"Tie one end around his waist.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Ri begged, fighting off the rope with his hands. \"You don't\nwant to use me, sir. Not after I told you.... Please, sir. If anything\nshould happen to me.... Please, sir. Don't do it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tie it,\" Extrone ordered.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir. Please. Oh,\n   \n   please\n   \n  don't, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tie it,\" Extrone said inexorably.\n  \n \n  Lin bent with the rope; his face was colorless.\n  \n<doc-sep>The farn beast coughed. Another answered. They were very near, and\nthere was a noise of crackling underbrush.\n  \n \n  \"He's good bait,\" Extrone said. \"He's fat enough and he knows how to\nscream good.\"\n  \n \n  Ri had stopped screaming; he was huddled against the tree, fearfully\neying the forest across from the watering hole.\n  \n \n  Extrone began to tremble with excitement. \"Here they come!\"\n  \n \n  The forest sprang apart. Extrone bent forward, the gun still across his\nlap.\n  \n \n  The farn beast, its tiny eyes red with hate, stepped out on the bank,\nswinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed.\nIts mate appeared beside it. Their tails thrashed against the scrubs\nbehind them, rattling leaves.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Shoot!\" Lin hissed. \"For God's sake, shoot!\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Extrone said. \"Let's see what they do.\" He had not moved\nthe rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath\nbeginning to sound like an asthmatic pump.\n  \n \n  The lead farn beast sighted Ri. It lowered its head.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Extrone cried excitedly. \"Here it comes!\"\n  \n \n  Ri began to scream again.\n  \n \n  Still Extrone did not lift his blast rifle. He was laughing. Lin\nwaited, frozen, his eyes staring at the farn beast in fascination.\n  \n \n  The farn beast plunged into the water, which was shallow, and, throwing\na sheet of it to either side, headed across toward Ri.\n  \n \n  \"Watch! Watch!\" Extrone cried gleefully.\n  \n \n  And then the aliens sprang their trap.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Four hours later, they were well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked\nleisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at\nthe vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their\nsharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and drank\ndeeply of the icy water to allay the heat of the forest, a heat made\noppressive by the press of foliage against the outside air.\n  \n \n  Ranging out, on both sides of the central body, the two businessmen\nfought independently against the wild growth, each scouting the flanks\nfor farn beasts, and ahead, beyond the cutters, Lin flittered among the\ntree trunks, sometimes far, sometimes near.\n  \n \n  Extrone carried the only weapon, slung easily over his shoulder, a\npowerful blast rifle, capable of piercing medium armor in sustained\nfire. To his rear, the water carrier was trailed by a man bearing a\nfolding stool, and behind him, a man carrying the heavy, high-powered\ntwo-way communication set.\n  \n \n  Once Extrone unslung his blast rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny,\narboreal mammal, which, upon the impact, shattered asunder, to\nExtrone's satisfied chuckle, in a burst of blood and fur.\n  \n \n  When the sun stood high and heat exhaustion made the near-naked bearers\nslump, Extrone permitted a rest. While waiting for the march to resume,\nhe sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted,\nreflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs.\n  \n \n  \"For you, sir,\" the communications man said, interrupting his reverie.\n  \n \n  \"Damn,\" Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. \"It better be\nimportant.\" He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The\nbearer twiddled the dials.\n  \n \n  \"Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother\nme?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn't\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"Blasted them right out of space,\" the voice crackled excitedly. \"Right\nin the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!\" Extrone\ntore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. \"If they call back,\nfind out what they want, first. I don't want to be bothered unless it's\nimportant.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone squinted up at the sun; his eyes crinkled under the glare, and\nperspiration stood in little droplets on the back of his hands.\n  \n \n  Lin, returning to the column, threaded his way among reclining\nbearers. He stopped before Extrone and tossed his hair out of his eyes.\n\"I located a spoor,\" he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. \"About\na quarter ahead. It looks fresh.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone's eyes lit with passion.\n  \n \n  Lin's face was red with heat and grimy with sweat. \"There were two, I\nthink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two?\" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. \"You and I better go forward\nand look at the spoor.\"\n  \n \n  Lin said, \"We ought to take protection, if you're going, too.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone laughed. \"This is enough.\" He gestured with the rifle and stood\nup.\n  \n \n  \"I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  \"One is enough in\n   \n   my\n   \n  camp.\"\n  \n"

Many of them used the external power of gravity,\nthey would wear out or slow down in time from friction, but for the\nmeanwhile, for some ten to two hundred years they would just sit there,\nmoving. No one had ever been able to figure out what to do with them.\n  \n \n  I knew the AEC wasn't going to dump tons of radioactive waste (with\nsome possible future reclaimation value) into a machine which they\ndidn't believe actually could work.\n  \n \n  Tony Carmen knew exactly what to do with an Expendable once he got his\nhands on it.\n  \n \n  Naturally, that was what I had been afraid of.\n  \n"

We'll call 'em Expendables, because they can expend\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  \"I,\" I interjected, \"planned to call it the Venetti Machine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Professor, who calls the radio the Marconi these days?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are Geiger-Muller Counters, though,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"You don't have to give a Geiger counter the sex appeal of a TV set or\na hardtop convertible. We'll call them Expendables. No home will be\ncomplete without one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Perfect for disposing of unwanted bodies,\" I mused. \"The murder rate\nwill go alarmingly with those devices within easy reach.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did that stop Sam Colt or Henry Ford?\" Tony Carmen asked reasonably....\n  \n \n  Naturally, I was aware that the government would\n   \n   not\n   \n  be interested in\nmy machine. I am not a Fortean, a psychic, a psionicist or a screwball.\nBut the government frequently gets things it doesn't know what to do\nwith\u2014like airplanes in the 'twenties. When it doesn't know what to do,\nit doesn't do it.\n  \n \n  There have been hundreds of workable perpetual motion machines\npatented, for example. Of course, they weren't vices in the strictest\nsense of the word. Many of them used the external power of gravity,\nthey would wear out or slow down in time from friction, but for the\nmeanwhile, for some ten to two hundred years they would just sit there,\nmoving. No one had ever been able to figure out what to do with them.\n  \n \n  I knew the AEC wasn't going to dump tons of radioactive waste (with\nsome possible future reclaimation value) into a machine which they\ndidn't believe actually could work.\n  \n \n  Tony Carmen knew exactly what to do with an Expendable once he got his\nhands on it.\n  \n \n  Naturally, that was what I had been afraid of.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE EXPENDABLES\n  \n \n  BY JIM HARMON\n  \n \n  It was just a little black box,\n   \n  useful for getting rid of things.\n   \n  Trouble was, it worked too well!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"You see my problem, Professor?\" Tony Carmen held his pinkly manicured,\nflashily ringed hands wide.\n  \n \n  I saw his problem and it was warmly embarrassing.\n  \n \n  \"Really, Mr. Carmen,\" I said, \"this isn't the sort of thing you discuss\nwith a total stranger. I'm not a doctor\u2014not of medicine, anyway\u2014or a\nlawyer.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't help me. I need an operator in your line.\"\n  \n \n  \"I work for the United States government. I can't become involved in\nanything illegal.\"\n  \n \n  Carmen smoothed down the front of his too-tight midnight blue suit and\ntouched the diamond sticking in his silver tie. \"You can't, Professor\nVenetti? Ever hear of the Mafia?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've heard of it,\" I said uneasily. \"An old fraternal organization\nsomething like the Moose or Rosicrucians, founded in Sicily. It\nallegedly controls organized crime in the U.S. But that is a\nresponsibility-eluding myth that honest Italian-Americans are stamping\nout. We don't even like to see the word in print.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can understand\n   \n   honest\n   \n  Italian-Americans feeling that way. But guys\nlike me know the Mafia is still with it. We can put the squeeze on\nmarks like you pretty easy.\"\n  \n \n  You don't have to tell even a third generation American about the\nMafia. Maybe that was the trouble. I had heard too much and for too\nlong. All the stories I had ever heard about the Mafia, true or false,\nbuilt up an unendurable threat.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll try to help you, Carmen. But ... that is, you didn't\nkill any of these people?\"\n  \n \n  He snorted. \"I haven't killed anybody since early 1943.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please,\" I said weakly. \"You needn't incriminate yourself with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was in the Marines,\" Carmen said hotly. \"Listen, Professor, these\naren't no Prohibition times. Not many people get made for a hit these\ndays. Mother, most of these bodies they keep ditching at my club\nhaven't been murdered by anybody. They're accident victims. Rumbums\nwith too much anti-freeze for a summer's day, Spanish-American War vets\ngoing to visit Teddy in the natural course of events. Harry Keno just\nstows them at my place to embarrass me. Figures to make me lose my\nliquor license or take a contempt before the Grand Jury.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose you could just go to the police\u2014\" I saw the answer in\nhis eyes. \"No. I don't suppose you could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you once, Professor, but I'll tell you again. I have to get rid\nof these bodies they keep leaving in my kitchen. I can take 'em and\nthrow them in the river, sure. But what if me or my boys are stopped en\nroute by some tipped badge?\"\n  \n \n  \"Quicklime?\" I suggested automatically.\n  \n \n  \"What are you talking about? Are you sure you're some kind of\nscientist? Lime doesn't do much to a stiff at all. Kind of putrifies\nthem like....\"\n  \n \n  \"I forgot,\" I admitted. \"I'd read it in so many stories I'd forgotten\nit wouldn't work. And I suppose the furnace leaves ashes and there's\nalways traces of hair and teeth in the garbage disposal... An\ninteresting problem, at that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I figured you could handle it,\" Carmen said, leaning back comfortably\nin the favorite chair of my bachelor apartment. \"I heard you were\nworking on something to get rid of trash for the government.\"\n  \n \n  \"That,\" I told him, \"is restricted information. I subcontracted that\nwork from the big telephone laboratories. How did you find it out?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ways, Professor, ways.\"\n  \n \n  The government did want me to find a way to dispose of\nwastes\u2014radioactive wastes. It was the most important problem any\ncountry could have in this time of growing atomic industry. Now a\nsmall-time gangster was asking me to use this research to help him\ndispose of hot corpses. It made my scientific blood seethe. But the\nshadow of the Black Hand cooled it off.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I can find something in that area of research to help you,\" I\nsaid. \"I'll call you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't take too long, Professor,\" Carmen said cordially.\n  \n<doc-sep>The agent of the AEC whose name I can never remember was present along\nwith Tony Carmen the night my assistants finished with the work I had\noutlined.\n  \n \n  While it was midnight outside, the fluorescents made the scene more\nvisible than sunlight. My Disexpendable was a medium-sized drum in a\ntripod frame with an unturned coolie's hat at the bottom.\n  \n \n  Breathlessly, I closed the switch and the scooped disc began slowly to\nrevolve.\n  \n \n  \"Is it my imagination,\" the agent asked, \"or is it getting cooler in\nhere?\"\n  \n \n  \"Professor.\" Carmen gave me a warning nudge.\n  \n \n  There was now something on the revolving disc. It was a bar of some\nshiny gray metal.\n  \n \n  \"Kill the power, Professor,\" Carmen said.\n  \n \n  \"Can it be,\" I wondered, \"that the machine is somehow recreating or\ndrawing back the processed material from some other time or dimension?\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut the thing off, Venetti!\" the racketeer demanded.\n  \n \n  But too late.\n  \n \n  There was now a somewhat dead man sitting in the saddle of the turning\ncircle of metal.\n  \n \n  If Harry Keno had only been sane when he turned up on that\nmerry-go-round in Boston I feel we would have learned much of immense\nvalue on the nature of time and space.\n  \n \n  As it is, I feel that it is a miscarriage of justice to hold me in\nconnection with the murders I am sure Tony Carmen did commit.\n  \n \n  I hope this personal account when published will end the vicious\nstory supported by the district attorney that it was I who sought Tony\nCarmen out and offered to dispose of his enemies and that I sought his\nfinancial backing for the exploitation of my invention.\n  \n \n  This is the true, and only true, account of the development of the\nmachine known as the Expendable.\n  \n \n  I am only sorry, now that the temperature has been standardized once\nmore, that the Expendable's antithesis, the Disexpendable, is of too\nlow an order of efficiency to be of much value as a power source in\nthese days of nuclear and solar energy. So the world is again stuck\nwith the problem of waste disposal ... including all that I dumped\nbefore. But as a great American once said, you can't win 'em all.\n  \n \n  If you so desire, you may send your generous and fruitful letters\ntowards my upcoming defense in care of this civic-minded publication.\n  \n"

Don\u2019t keep us in suspense any\nlonger. What did you wish?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cPatience,\u201d Judy said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m coming\nto that.\u201d\n  \n \n  First, she told her friends, she had to think of a\nwise wish. There had been so much she wanted in\nthose early days before the flood. Dora Scott had\nbeen her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved\naway.\n  \n \n  \u201cYou see,\u201d she explained, \u201cI made the mistake of\nhaving just one best friend. There wasn\u2019t anybody\nin Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how\nlonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,\n  and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made\nlittle ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before\nthey vanished, and so I began naming the things I\nwanted as fast as I could. I\u2019m not sure they were\nwise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I\nwasn\u2019t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,\nand what I wanted. It wasn\u2019t until after I began to\nthink of others that my wishes started to come true.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut what were they?\u201d Lois insisted.\n  \n \n  Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.\nJudy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied\nairily, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t I tell you? I wished for lots\nof friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a\nG-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that\u2019s as far\nas I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the\nspell was broken and so I didn\u2019t wish for anything\nmore.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWasn\u2019t there anything more you wanted?\u201d Lois\nasked.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Judy. \u201cThere were lots more\nthings. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep\npets, and have a nice home, and\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd your wishes all came true!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cEvery one of them,\u201d Judy agreed, \u201ceven the one\nabout the sister. You see, it wasn\u2019t a baby sister I\nwanted. It was a sister near my own age. That\nseemed impossible at the time, but the future did\nhold a sister for me.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt held one for me, too,\u201d Lois said, squeezing\nLorraine\u2019s hand under the table. \u201cDon\u2019t you think\nsisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHoney and I always do,\u201d she replied \u201cbut then\nit was different. I didn\u2019t know I would marry Peter\nor that he would become a G-man, and he didn\u2019t\nknow he had a sister. It is strange, isn\u2019t it? But the\nstrangest thing of all was the fountain itself.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Lorraine. \u201cDo you still think it was\nenchanted?\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she\nanswered, \u201cI was still little girl enough to think so\nat the time. I wandered around, growing very\ndrowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into\nit. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember\nwaking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain\nhad been a dream.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cA hammock?\u201d Lois questioned. \u201cAre you sure it\nwasn\u2019t a flying carpet?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNo, it was a hammock all right,\u201d Judy assured\nher, laughing. \u201cIt was hung between two trees in a\nbeautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick\nwith roses. Did I tell you it was June?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAll the year around?\u201d\n  \n \n  Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about rose gardens in June. It\u2019s a long\nway from June to December.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDo you mean a garden changes? I know,\u201d Judy\nsaid, \u201cbut I think this one would be beautiful at any\ntime of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,\nand I don\u2019t know how many different kinds of evergreens.\nI explored the garden all around the fountain.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d Lorraine urged her.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, yes. Go on,\u201d entreated Lois. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream\nyou\u2019d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn\u2019t\nyou try to solve the mystery?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think I would have tried,\u201d Judy admitted, \u201cif\nI had been older or more experienced. I really should\nhave investigated it more thoroughly and learned the\nsecret of the fountain. But after the ripples went\naway it didn\u2019t speak to me any more, and I didn\u2019t\nreally think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing\nfor a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem\nimpossible for us to be friends at first, didn\u2019t it? Lorraine\nwas your friend.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI did make trouble for you,\u201d Lorraine remembered.\n\u201cIt was all because of my foolish jealousy.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt was nothing compared to the trouble caused by\nthe Roulsville flood,\u201d declared Judy. \u201cAfter that\nthings started happening so fast that I completely\nforgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don\u2019t\nbelieve I thought about it again until after we moved\nto Farringdon and I walked up to your door and\nsaw the fountain on your lawn.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,\u201d\nLois said with a giggle. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots nicer fountains.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou have?\u201d asked Judy. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ve\nseen the one I\u2019ve been telling you about. I think the\npicture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I\u2019ll\nshow you.\u201d\n  \n \n  Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while\nJudy was telling them the story of the fountain.\nSomehow, she wasn\u2019t hungry for hers. She had\ntasted it too often while she was making it.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ll leave it for Blackberry,\u201d she decided.\n  \n \n  Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up\nthe chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously\nwith cream.\n  \n \n  \u201cSometimes,\u201d Judy said fondly, \u201cBlackberry thinks\nhe\u2019s a person. He eats everything we eat, including\nlettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?\nHe wants to explore the attic, too.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cHe\u2019ll remember he\u2019s a cat fast enough if there\nare any mice up there,\u201d Lois said with a giggle.\n  \n \n  Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with\nthe cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her\ngrandparents\u2019 house to suit her own and Peter\u2019s\ntastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was\nremoved. But there was still a door closing off the\nnarrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry\nreached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.\n  \n \n  \u201cHe can read my mind. He always knows where\nI\u2019m going,\u201d Judy said as the door creaked open and\nthe cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling\nnoise came from the floor above.\n  \n \n  \u201cCome on. There\u2019s nothing up here to be afraid\nof,\u201d Judy urged her friends.\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m beginning to get the shivers,\u201d\nconfessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing\nroom at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n  \n \n  \u201cSo am I,\u201d Lorraine admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious\nabout black cats, but they are creepy. Does\nBlackberry have to roll spools across the floor?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNow he thinks he\u2019s a kitten,\u201d laughed Judy.\nPausing at still another door that led to the darker\npart of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,\n\u201cUp here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody\ncare to explore the past?\u201d\n  \n \n  The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy\nrelating still more of what she remembered about\nthe fountain.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhen I told Grandma about it she laughed and\nsaid I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came\ntrue that easily she\u2019d be living in a castle. But would\nshe?\u201d Judy wondered. \u201cWhen I first remember this\nhouse she was still burning kerosene lamps like those\nyou see on that high shelf by the window. I think\nshe and Grandpa like the way they lived without\nany modern conveniences or anything.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so, too,\u201d Lois agreed, looking around the\nold attic with a shiver. \u201cIt is strange they both died\nthe same winter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cMaybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they\nwished neither of them would outlive the other. If\nthey did wish in the fountain,\u201d Judy went on more\nthoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019m sure that was one of their wishes.\nAnother could have been to keep the good old days,\nas Grandma used to call them. That one came true\nin a way. They did manage to keep a little of the\npast when they kept all these old things. That\u2019s what\nI meant about turning back the clock.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIf wishes came true I\u2019d like to turn it back a little\nmyself,\u201d Lorraine began. \u201cIt would be nice if things\nwere the way they used to be when I trusted\nArthur\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cDon\u2019t you trust him now?\u201d Judy asked.\n  \n \n  Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois\nand Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all\nshe would say. Judy wondered, as they searched\nthrough the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine\nwas of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed\nmonster coming between her and her handsome husband,\nArthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had\nseemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness\nin Lorraine\u2019s face as she gazed at a picture of one of\nthe fountains and then said in a tight little voice, \u201cIt\nis. It\u2019s the very same one.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut that\u2019s the picture I\u2019ve been searching for!\u201d\nJudy said eagerly. \u201cDo you know where it is?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI can\u2019t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I\u2019m\nsure it isn\u2019t now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lorraine said suddenly\nto Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.\nBut, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.\nIf she did, she pretended not to.\n  \n \n  \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo the fountain? I\u2019d love\nto, wouldn\u2019t you, Judy?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI certainly would,\u201d Judy replied enthusiastically.\n\u201cDo you recognize it, too?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI think so,\u201d Lois answered after studying a little\nmore closely the picture they had found. \u201cIt looks\nlike the fountain on the Brandt estate.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThe department store Brandts?\u201d Judy questioned.\n\u201cThen my grandparents must have driven old Fanny\nall the way to Farringdon.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNot quite all the way,\u201d Lorraine objected. \u201cThe\nBrandts own that stretch of woods just before you\ncome into the city. You\u2019ve passed it lots of times.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course,\u201d agreed Judy. She put the magazine\nback in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly\nto her friends. \u201cI do remember a road turning off\ninto the woods and going on uphill,\u201d she told them.\n\u201cI never thought it led to a house, though. There\nisn\u2019t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents\ntook?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWhy don\u2019t we take it ourselves and find out?\u201d\nLois suggested.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>   The other gods\n   \n  , Dotty dreamt,\n   \n   are combing the whole Universe for us.\nWe have escaped them many times, but now our tricks are almost used up.\nThere are no doors going out of the Universe and our boats are silver\nbeacons to the hunters. So we decide to disguise them in the only way\nthey can be disguised. It is our last chance.\n   \n \n"

You shut yourself off from your family.\nYou had no close friends, no women. You had no other interests. You were\na rocket pilot\u2014nothing else. You've never read an adult book that\nwasn't a text; you've never listened to a symphony except by accident.\nYou don't know Rembrandt from Norman Rockwell. Nothing.

But the\nquestions fell into a pattern that was far from casual, and Ish could\nsee the small button-mike of a portable tape-recorder nestling under the\nman's lapel.\n  \n \n  \"Been working your own way for the last seventeen years, haven't you?\"\nMacKenzie seemed to mumble in a perfectly clear voice.\n  \n \n  Ish nodded.\n  \n \n  \"How's that?\"\n  \n \n  The corners of Isherwood's mouth twitched, and he said \"Yes\" for the\nrecorder's benefit.\n  \n \n  \"Odd jobs, first of all?\"\n  \n \n  \"Something like that. Anything I could get, the first few months. After\nI was halfway set up, I stuck to garages and repair shops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out at the airports around Miami, mostly, wasn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ahuh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Took some of your pay in flying lessons.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right.\"\n  \n \n  MacKenzie's face passed no judgements\u2014he simply hunched in his chair,\nseemingly dwarfed by the shoulders of his perfectly tailored suit, his\nstubby fingers twiddling a Phi Beta Kappa key. He was a spare man\u2014only\na step or two away from emaciation. Occasionally, he pushed a tired\nstrand of washed-out hair away from his forehead.\n  \n \n  Ish answered him truthfully, without more than ordinary reservations.\nThis was the man who could ground him He was dangerous\u2014red-letter\ndangerous\u2014because of it.\n  \n \n  \"No family.\"\n  \n \n  Ish shrugged. \"Not that I know of. Cut out at seventeen. My father was\nmaking good money. He had a pension plan, insurance policies.

Suddenly, he sat bolt upright in his chair, and swung\ntoward Ish. His lean arm shot out, and his index finger was aimed\nbetween Isherwood's eyes. \"You can't go!\"\n  \n \n  Ish was on his feet, his fists clenched, the blood throbbing in his\ntemple veins. \"What!\" he roared.\n  \n \n  MacKenzie seemed to collapse in his chair. The brief commanding burst\nwas over, and his face was apologetic, \"Sorry,\" he said. He seemed\ngenuinely abashed. \"Shotgun therapy. Works best, sometimes. You can go,\nall right; I just wanted to get a fast check on your reactions and\ndrives.\"\n  \n \n  Ish could feel the anger that still ran through him\u2014anger, and more\nfear than he wanted to admit. \"I'm due at a briefing,\" he said tautly.\n\"You through with me?\"\n  \n \n  MacKenzie nodded, still embarrassed. \"Sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Ish ignored the man's obvious feelings. He stopped at the door to send a\nparting stroke at the thing that had frightened him. \"Big gun in the\npsychiatry racket, huh? Well, your professional lingo's slipping, Doc.\nThey did put\n   \n   some\n   \n  learning in my head at college, you know. Therapy,\nhell! Testing maybe, but you sure didn't do anything to help me!\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" MacKenzie said softly. \"I wish I did.\"\n  \n \n  Ish slammed the door behind him. He stood in the corridor, jamming a\nfresh cigarette in his mouth. He threw a glance at his watch. Twelve\nhours, twenty-two minutes, and four days to go.\n  \n \n  Damn! He was late for the briefing. Odd\u2014that fool psychiatrist hadn't\nseemed to take up that much of his time.\n  \n \n  He shrugged. What difference did it make? As he strode down the hall, he\nlost his momentary puzzlement under the flood of realization that\nnothing could stop him now, that the last hurdle was beaten. He was\ngoing. He was going, and if there were faint echoes of \"Marty!\" ringing\nin the dark background of his mind, they only served to push him faster,\nas they always had. Nothing but death could stop him now.\n  \n \n \n"

I keep telling myself that my movements were not\nactually deliberate. I was to the right of her. The turn was to the\nleft. She turned quickly, and I didn't, so that I bumped into her,\nknocking her off balance. I grabbed her to keep her from falling.\n  \n \n  For a moment we stood there, face to face, touching each other lightly.\nI held her by the arms. I felt the primitive warmth of her breath. Our\neyes held together ... proton ... electron ... I felt her tremble.\n  \n \n  She broke from my grip suddenly and started off again.\n  \n \n  After that she was very business-like.\n  \n \n  We came finally to the controls of Bank 29 and she stood before them\nand began to press button combinations. I watched her work; I watched\nher move. I had almost forgotten why I'd come here. The lights blinked\non and off and the typers clacked softly as the machine sorted out\ninformation.\n  \n \n  She had a long printed sheet from the roll presently. She frowned at\nit and turned to me. \"You can take this along and study it,\" she said,\n\"but I'm afraid what you have in mind may be\u2014a little difficult.\"\n  \n \n  She must have guessed what I had in mind.

        "\n  The\n  cool green disk of Alphard\nSix on the screen was\ninfinitely welcome after the arid\ndesolation and stinking swamplands\nof the inner planets, an\nairy jewel of a world that might\nhave been designed specifically\nfor the hard-earned month of\nrest ahead. Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees.",
        " Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

Minor spelling and\ntypographical errors have been corrected without note.\n\n<doc-sep>When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n  \n"

        "  ACID BATH\n  \n \n  By VASELEOS GARSON\n  \n \n \n \n    The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments\nin his singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid. But nothing like the\nweird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.\n    \n \n \n<doc-sep>\n  Jon\n  followed him through the sundered\nlock of the station. Karyl stopped for a\nmoment to examine the wreckage of the\nlock. It had been punched full of holes as\nif it had been some soft cheese instead of a\nmetal which Earthmen had spent nearly a\ncentury perfecting.\n  \n \n  \"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue\nsaid. \"But that metal also is found on\nour world. It's probably the softest and most\nmalleable we have. We were surprised you\u2014earthmen,\nis it?\u2014use it as protective\nmetal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why are you in this system?\" Jon asked,\nhardly expecting an answer.\n  \n \n  It came anyway. \"For the same reason you\nEarthmen are reaching out farther into your\nsystem. We need living room. You have\nstrategically placed planets for our use. We\nwill use them.\"\n  \n \n  Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had\nbeen preaching preparedness as Earth flung\nher ships into the reaches of the solar system,\ntaking the first long step toward the\nconquest of space.\n  \n \n  There are other races somewhere, they\nargued. As strong and smart as man, many\nof them so transcending man in mental and\ninventive power that we must be prepared to\nstrike the minute danger shows.\n  \n \n  Now here was the answer to the scientists'\nwarning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.\n  \n \n  \"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue.\n\"I couldn't understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered.\nIt was a welcome surprise. Apparently his\nthoughts had to be directed outward, rather\nthan inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to\nread it.\n  \n \n  He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping\nlock of the invaders' space ship wondering\nhow he could warn Earth. The Space\nPatrol cruiser was due in for refueling at\nhis service station in 21 days. But by that\ntime he probably would be mouldering in\nthe rocky dust of the asteroid.\n  \n \n  It was pitch dark within the ship but the\nSteel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all\nmaneuvering through the maze of corridors.\nJon followed him, attached to one tentacle.\n  \n \n  Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular\nroom, bright with light streaming from\na glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently\nwere near topside of the vessel.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue, more massive than his\nguide and with four more pair of tentacles,\nincluding two short ones that grew from the\ntop of its head, spoke out.\n  \n \n  \"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue\nnodded.\n  \n \n  \"You know the penalty? Carry it out.\"\n  \n \n  \"He also is an inhabitant of this system,\"\nJon's guide added.\n  \n \n  \"Examine him first, then give him the\ndeath.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl shrugged as he was led from\nthe lighted room through more corridors.\nIf it got too bad he still had the stubray\npistol.\n  \n \n  Anyway, he was curious. He'd taken on\nthe lonely, nerve-wracking job of service\nstation attendant just to see what it offered.\n  \n \n  Here was a part of it, and it was certainly\nsomething new.\n  \n \n  \"This is the examination room,\" his\nSteel-Blue said, almost contemptuously.\n  \n \n  A green effulgence surrounded him.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\n  There\n  , just ahead of him, was the lock\nleading into the service station. Slipping\na key out of a leg pouch on the space suit,\nhe jabbed it into the center of the lock,\nopening the lever housing.\n  \n \n  He pulled strongly on the lever. With a\nhiss of escaping air, the lock swung open.\nJon Karyl darted inside, the door closing\nsoftly behind.\n  \n \n  At the end of the long tunnel he stepped\nto the televisor which was fixed on the area\nsurrounding the station.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures.\nBut he saw their ship. It squatted\nlike a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut\ntight.\n  \n \n  He tuned the televisor to its widest range\nand finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.\nHe was looking into the stationary rocket\nengine.\n  \n \n  As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue\ncame crawling out of the ship.\n  \n \n  The two Steel-Blues moved toward the\ncenter of the televisor range. They're coming\ntoward the station, Karyl thought grimly.\n  \n \n  Karyl examined the two creatures. They\nwere of the steel-blue color from the crown\nof their egg-shaped heads to the tips of\ntheir walking appendages.\n  \n \n  They were about the height of Karyl\u2014six\nfeet. But where he tapered from broad\nshoulders to flat hips, they were straight up\nand down. They had no legs, just appendages,\nmany-jointed that stretched and\nshrank independent of the other, but keeping\nthe cylindrical body with its four pairs\nof tentacles on a level balance.\n  \n \n  Where their eyes would have been was\nan elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the\negg-head, with its converging ends curving\naround the sides of the head.\n  \n \n  Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But\nwhere were their masters?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues moved out of the range\nof the televisor. A minute later Jon heard\na pounding from the station upstairs.\n  \n \n  He chuckled. They were like the wolf of\npre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to\nblow the house down.\n  \n \n  The outer shell of the station was formed\nfrom stelrylite, the toughest metal in the\nsolar system. With the self-sealing lock of\nthe same resistant material, a mere pounding\nwas nothing.\n  \n \n  Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway.\nHe went up the steel ladder leading to the\nstation's power plant and the televisor that\ncould look into every room within the\nstation.\n  \n \n  He heaved a slight sigh when he reached\nthe power room, for right at his hand were\nweapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.\n  \n \n  Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the\nlock to the station. His teeth suddenly\nclamped down on his lower lip.\n  \n \n  Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes\ninto the stelrylite with round-headed metal\nclubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't\nbreak up that easily.\n  \n \n  Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up\nthe revolving turret which capped the station\nso that its thin fin pointed at the\nsquat ship of the invaders.\n  \n \n  Then he went to the atomic cannon's\nfiring buttons.\n  \n \n  He pressed first the yellow, then the blue\nbutton. Finally the red one.\n  \n \n  The thin fin\u2014the cannon's sight\u2014split in\nhalf as the turret opened and the coiled nose\nof the cannon protruded. There was a\nsoundless flash. Then a sharp crack.\n  \n \n  Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the\nbolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship\nof the solar system. There was nothing that\ncould withstand even the slight jolt of power\ngiven by the station cannon on any of the\nSun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of\nthe ship had changed. A bubble of metal,\nlike a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off\nthe vessel and struck the rocket of the\nasteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n  \n \n  He pressed the red button again.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly he was on the floor of the\npower room, his legs strangely cut out from\nunder him. He tried to move them. They lay\nflaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried\nto lever himself to an upright position.\n  \n \n  Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed\nfrom the waist down. But it couldn't\nhappen that suddenly.\n  \n \n  He turned his head.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked\ntentacle held a square black box.\n  \n \n  Jon could read nothing in that metallic\nface. He said, voice muffled by the confines\nof the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am\"\u2014there was a rising inflection in\nthe answer\u2014\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n  \n \n  There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's\nface to move. \"That is what I have named\nyou,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer.\nJon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue\nwas telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered.\n\"We talk in the language of the\nmind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning\nwith the square black box.\n  \n \n  The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed\nthe Steel-Blue, aware that the lens\nhe'd seen on the creature's face had a\ncounterpart on the back of the egg-head.\n  \n \n  Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.\nThat's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\"\nSteel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's\nmind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he\nhad applied for this high-paying but man-killing\njob as a Lone Watcher on the Solar\nSystem's starways.\n  \n \n  He had little fear now, only curiosity.\nThese Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.\nThey could have snuffed out my life very\nsimply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be\nfriends.\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue chuckled.\n  \n \n"

But nothing like the\nweird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.\n    \n \n \n<doc-sep>When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature\u2014authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>  Jinx Ship To The Rescue\n  \n \n  By ALFRED COPPEL, JR.\n  \n \n  Stand by for\n   \n   T.R.S. Aphrodite\n   \n  , butt of the Space\n   \n  Navy. She's got something terrific in her guts and only\n   \n  her ice-cold lady engineer can coax it out of her!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1948.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III of the\nTellurian Wing, Combined Solarian Navies, stood ankle deep in the\nviscous mud of Venusport Base and surveyed his new command with a\njaundiced eye. The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.\n  \n \n  Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth\nof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together\nthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.\n  \n \n  The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  loomed\nunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the\nventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the\nfat spaceship.\n  \n \n  \"It looks,\" he commented bitterly, \"like a pregnant carp.\"\n  \n \n  Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley\u2014\"Cob\" to his friends\u2014nodded in\nagreement. \"That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The ship\nwith the poison personality.\" Cob was the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  Executive,\nand he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execs\non the\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  . She generally sent them Earthside with nervous\nbreakdowns in half that time.\n  \n \n  \"Tell me, Captain,\" continued Cob curiously, \"how does it happen\nthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? I\nthought....\"\n  \n \n  \"You know Gorman?\" queried Strykalski.\n  \n \n  Cob nodded. \"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\"\n  \n \n  \"The same.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's\na prize stinker ... but you were in command of the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . And,\nafter all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come\nthis?\" He indicated the monitor expressively.\n  \n \n  Strike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with\nme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you\nwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp\noperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy with\ntradition.\n  \n \n  \"The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polish\nimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and Congressional\nMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in the\nabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a United\nNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...\nme.\n  \n \n  \"From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But something\nhappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest of\nthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.\n  \n \n  \"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the\nwrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too\nmuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  because I left my station where I was supposed to be running\nsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in\ndanger....\"\n  \n \n  \"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob.\n  \n \n  \"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical\nastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my\nroutine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No\nnova. I made an ass of myself and lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . Gorman gave it\nto his former aide. I got this.\"\n  \n \n  Cob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me again. The\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.\nWe celebrated a bit too freely.\"\n  \n \n  Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night\nafter the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,\nwasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\"\n  \n \n  \"Canalopolis?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded.\n  \n \n  \"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian\nEmbassy Ball.\"\n  \n \n  \"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Strike's the name, Cob.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like\nour old tin pot here.\" He patted the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  nether belly\naffectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to\nmeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\"\n  \n \n  Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . \"She'll\ncarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket\nfuel, anyway. Deep space?\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Cob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run. Hot work.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.\n\"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.\"\n  \n \n  Cob nodded agreement. \"The last of her class.\"\n  \n"

Finally the red one.\n  \n \n  The thin fin\u2014the cannon's sight\u2014split in\nhalf as the turret opened and the coiled nose\nof the cannon protruded. There was a\nsoundless flash. Then a sharp crack.\n  \n \n  Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the\nbolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship\nof the solar system. There was nothing that\ncould withstand even the slight jolt of power\ngiven by the station cannon on any of the\nSun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of\nthe ship had changed. A bubble of metal,\nlike a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off\nthe vessel and struck the rocket of the\nasteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n  \n \n  He pressed the red button again.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly he was on the floor of the\npower room, his legs strangely cut out from\nunder him. He tried to move them. They lay\nflaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried\nto lever himself to an upright position.\n  \n \n  Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed\nfrom the waist down. But it couldn't\nhappen that suddenly.\n  \n \n  He turned his head.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked\ntentacle held a square black box.\n  \n \n  Jon could read nothing in that metallic\nface. He said, voice muffled by the confines\nof the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am\"\u2014there was a rising inflection in\nthe answer\u2014\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n  \n \n  There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's\nface to move. \"That is what I have named\nyou,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer.\nJon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue\nwas telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered.\n\"We talk in the language of the\nmind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning\nwith the square black box.\n  \n \n  The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed\nthe Steel-Blue, aware that the lens\nhe'd seen on the creature's face had a\ncounterpart on the back of the egg-head.\n  \n \n  Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.\nThat's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\"\nSteel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's\nmind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he\nhad applied for this high-paying but man-killing\njob as a Lone Watcher on the Solar\nSystem's starways.\n  \n \n  He had little fear now, only curiosity.\nThese Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.\nThey could have snuffed out my life very\nsimply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be\nfriends.\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue chuckled.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>  ACID BATH\n  \n \n  By VASELEOS GARSON\n  \n \n \n \n    The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments\nin his singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid. But nothing like the\nweird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.\n    \n \n \n<doc-sep>\n  He was\n  still weak days later when\nCapt. Ron Small of SP-101 said,\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Karyl, it's ironical. They fed you\nwhat they thought was sure death, and it's\nthe only thing that kept you going long\nenough to warn us.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was dumb for a long time,\" Karyl said.\n\"I thought that it was the acid, almost to\nthe very last. But when I drank that last\nglass, I knew they didn't have a chance.\n  \n \n  \"They were metal monsters. No wonder\nthey feared that liquid. It would rust their\njoints, short their wiring, and kill them.\nNo wonder they stared when I kept alive\nafter drinking enough to completely annihilate\na half-dozen of them.\n  \n \n  \"But what happened when you met the\nship?\"\n  \n \n  The space captain grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Not much. Our crew was busy creating\na hollow shell filled with\n   \n   water\n   \n  to be shot\nout of a rocket tube converted into a projectile\nthrower.\n  \n \n  \"These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put\ntraction beams on us and started tugging us\ntoward the asteroid. We tried a couple of\natomic shots but when they just glanced off,\nwe gave up.\n  \n \n  \"They weren't expecting the shell of\nwater. When it hit that blue ship, you could\nalmost see it oxidize before your eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I guess they knew what was wrong right\naway. They let go the traction beams and\ntried to get away. They forgot about the\nforce field, so we just poured atomic fire\ninto the weakening ship. It just melted\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl got up from the divan where\nhe'd been lying. \"They thought I was a\nmetal creature, too. But where do you suppose\nthey came from?\"\n  \n \n  The captain shrugged. \"Who knows?\"\n  \n \n  Jon set two glasses on the table.\n  \n \n  \"Have a drink of the best damn water in\nthe solar system?\" He asked Capt. Small.\n  \n \n  \"Don't mind if I do.\"\n  \n \n  The water twinkled in the two glasses,\nwinking as if it knew just what it had\ndone.\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Planet Stories\n  \n July 1952.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n<doc-sep>Remembering his grudge against the manager, he took pleasure in walking\nin without knocking.\n  \n \n  \"Jeffers,\" he announced, \"this is ... just call her Betty.\"\n  \n \n  The manager's jowled features twisted into an expression of welcome as\njovial as that of a hungry crocodile.\n  \n \n  \"Miss Koslow!\" he beamed, like a politician the day before the voting.\n\"It certainly is an honor to have you on Ganymede with us! That's all,\nTolliver, you can go. Yes, indeed! Mr. Koslow\u2014the president, that is:\nyour father\u2014sent a message about you. I repeat, it will be an honor to\nshow you the ropes. Did you want something else, Tolliver?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind him, Mr. Jeffers,\" snapped the girl, in a tone new to\nTolliver. \"We won't be working together, I'm afraid. You've already had\nenough rope.\"\n  \n \n  Jeffers seemed to stagger standing still behind his desk. His loose\nlips twitched uncertainly, and he looked questioningly to Tolliver. The\npilot stared at Betty, trying to recall pictures he had seen of the\nelder Koslow. He was also trying to remember some of the lies he had\ntold en route from the spaceport.\n  \n \n  \"Wh-wh-what do you mean, Miss Koslow?\" Jeffers stammered.\n  \n \n  He darted a suspicious glare at Tolliver.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Jeffers,\" said the girl, \"I may look like just another spoiled\nlittle blonde, but the best part of this company will be mine someday.\nI was not allowed to reach twenty-two without learning something about\nholding on to it.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver blinked. He had taken her for three or four years older.\nJeffers now ignored him, intent upon the girl.\n  \n \n  \"Daddy gave me the title of tenth vice-president mostly as a joke, when\nhe told me to find out what was wrong with operations on Ganymede.\nI have\n   \n   some\n   \n  authority, though. And you look like the source of the\ntrouble to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't prove anything,\" declared Jeffers hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, can't I? I've already seen certain evidence, and the rest won't\nbe hard to find. Where are your books, Mr. Jeffers? You're as good as\nfired!\"\n  \n \n  The manager dropped heavily to his chair. He stared unbelievingly at\nBetty, and Tolliver thought he muttered something about \"just landed.\"\nAfter a moment, the big man came out of his daze enough to stab an\nintercom button with his finger. He growled at someone on the other end\nto come in without a countdown.\n  \n \n  Tolliver, hardly thinking about it, expected the someone to be\na secretary, but it turned out to be three members of Jeffers'\nheadquarters staff. He recognized one as Rawlins, a warehouse chief,\nand guessed that the other two might be his assistants. They were large\nenough.\n  \n \n  \"No stupid questions!\" Jeffers ordered. \"Lock these two up while I\nthink!\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver started for the door immediately, but was blocked off.\n  \n \n  \"Where should we lock\u2014?\" the fellow paused to ask.\n  \n \n  Tolliver brought up a snappy uppercut to the man's chin, feeling that\nit was a poor time to engage Jeffers in fruitless debate.\n  \n \n  In the gravity of Ganymede, the man was knocked off balance as much as\nhe was hurt, and sprawled on the floor.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   told\n   \n  you no questions!\" bawled Jeffers.\n  \n \n  The fallen hero, upon arising, had to content himself with grabbing\nBetty. The others were swarming over Tolliver. Jeffers came around his\ndesk to assist.\n  \n"

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Well, no matter. Mr. Grotton would have to excuse his trespass. He\nopened the gate, led Plum through it, closed the gate. He mounted and\nrode forward, still north, toward the small Pangborn place and after\nthe Pangborns the biggest farm in the county\u2014old Wallace Elverton's\nplace. The fields here, as everywhere in the county, lay fallow. Seemed\nas if the government had so much grain stored up they'd be able to get\nalong without crops for years more.\n  \n \n  He looked around. Somehow, the country bothered him. He wasn't sure\nwhy, but ... everything was wrong.\n  \n \n  His head weighed an agonized ton. He put it down again. Plum went\nsedately forward. After a while she stopped. Harry looked up. Another\nfence. And what a fence! About ten feet of heavy steel mesh, topped by\nthree feet of barbed-wire\u2014five separate strands. What in the world had\nSam Pangborn been thinking of to put up a monster like this?\n  \n \n  He looked around. The gate should be further west. He rode that way.\nHe found no gate. He turned back, heading east. No gate. Nothing but\nfence. And wasn't the fence gradually curving inward? He looked back.\nYes, there\n   \n   was\n   \n  a slight inward curve.\n  \n \n  He dismounted and tied Plum to the fence, then stepped back and figured\nthe best way to get to the other side.\n  \n \n  The best way, the only way, was to claw, clutch and clamber, as they\nused to say back when he was a kid.\n  \n \n \n \n  It took some doing. He tore his shirt on the barbed wire, but he got\nover and began walking, straight ahead, due north. The earth changed\nbeneath his feet. He stooped and touched it. Sand. Hard-packed sand.\nHe'd never seen the like of it in this county.\n  \n \n  He walked on. A sound came to him; a rising-falling whisper. He\nlistened to it, and looked up every so often at the sky, to make sure\nhe was heading in the right direction.\n  \n \n  And the sand ended. His shoes plunked over flooring.\n  \n \n  Flooring!\n  \n \n  He knelt to make sure, and his hand felt wooden planks. He rose, and\nglanced up to see if he was still outdoors. Then he laughed. It was a\nsick laugh, so he stopped it.\n  \n \n  He took another step. His shoes sounded against the wood. He walked.\nMore wood. Wood that went on, as the sand had. And the roaring sound\ngrowing louder. And the air changing, smelling like air never had\nbefore in Cultwait County.\n  \n<doc-sep>Humphrey Fownes took out the dust jacket he'd found in the library. He\nheld it up and carefully compared the spinning cloud in his bedroom\nwith the illustration.

If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\n  \n \n  A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\n  \n \n  Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n  \n \n  No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\nthe mud.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\n  \n \n  \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\nsoon.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n  \n \n  \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n  \n \n  Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\nit would make.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n  \n \n  \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\nhardly believe it yet.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\nstraight?\"\n  \n \n  Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n  \n \n  \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\nthe machine-gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\nthem may not have got back yet.\"\n  \n"

Listen to me.\nBack there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through\ntraffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the\nseat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.\n  \n \n  \"1368 Hurst Road.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's here in Pikeville?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen\nto me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Where?\" Loyce echoed.\n  \n \n  \"You weren't in your shop, were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\"\n  \n \n  \"In the\n   \n   basement\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame.\nWhy?

I guess I sort of went off the deep\nend. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like\nthe Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now.

Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe\ncoat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n  \n"

Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he\nliked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!\n  \n \n  It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying\ncommuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and\npackages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks\nand businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red\nlight and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;\nhe'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the\nrecords of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove\nslowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the\ntown park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again\nhe passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain\nand bench and single lamppost.\n  \n \n  From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,\nswinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled\ndown his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of\nsome kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n  \n \n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body. A human body.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing?

That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n"

        "We slowly circled the alien structure. Several minutes later, Kane\nshouted, \"Look!\"\n  \n \n  A few feet above the ground, the structure's smooth surface was broken\nby a circular opening that yawned invitingly. Kane ran ahead and\nflashed his head-lamp into the dark recess.\n  \n \n  \"There's a small room inside,\" he told us, and climbed through the\nopening.\n  \n \n  We waited outside and focused our lamps through the five-foot opening\nto give him as much light as possible.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, Marie,\" he called to his wife. \"This is really something!\nIt\n   \n   must\n   \n  be an alien race. There's all kinds of weird drawings on the\nwalls and gadgets that look like controls for something....\"\n  \n \n  Briefly, my lamp flickered over Marie's pale face. Her features\nstruggled with two conflicting emotions: She was frightened by the\nalienness of the thing and yet she wanted to be with her husband. She\nhesitated momentarily, then climbed through the passage.\n  \n \n  \"You want to go in?\" my wife asked.\n  \n \n  \"Do you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's.\"\n  \n \n  I helped Verana through the opening, climbed through myself and turned\nto help Miller.\n  \n \n  Miller was sixty years old. He was an excellent mineralogist, alert\nmentally, but with a body that was almost feeble. I reached out to help\nhim as he stepped into the passageway.\n  \n \n  For a brief second, he was framed in the opening, a dark silhouette\nagainst the star-studded sky.\n  \n \n  The next second, he was thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped\nwith pain when he struck the ground. \"\n   \n   Something\n   \n  pushed me!\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  He had fallen on a spot beyond our angle of vision. I started through\nthe passage....\n  \n \n  ... and struck an invisible solid wall.\n  \n<doc-sep>At Halden's signal, the lights flared up and the screen became too\nbright for anything to be visible.\n  \n \n  \"Go in and get them,\" said Halden. \"We don't want the pests to find out\nthat the bodies aren't flesh.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was realistic enough,\" said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their\nmachines and went out. \"Do you think it will work?\"\n  \n \n  \"It might. We had an audience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did we? I didn't notice.\" Meredith leaned back. \"Were the puppets\nexactly like the pests? And if not, will the pests be fooled?\"\n  \n \n  \"The electronic puppets were a good imitation, but the animals don't\nhave to identify them as their species. If they're smart enough,\nthey'll know the value of a knife, no matter who uses it.\"\n  \n \n  \"What if they're smarter? Suppose they know a knife can't be used by a\ncreature without real hands?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's part of our precautions. They'll never know until they try\u2014and\nthey'll never get away from the trap to try.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very good. I never thought of that,\" said Meredith, coming closer. \"I\nlike the way your primitive mind works. At times I actually think of\nmarrying you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Primitive,\" he said, alternately frozen and thawed, though he knew\nthat, in relation to her, he was\n   \n   not\n   \n  advanced.\n  \n \n  \"It's almost a curse, isn't it?\" She laughed and took the curse away by\nleaning provocatively against him. \"But barbaric lovers are often nice.\"\n  \n \n  Here we go again, he thought drearily, sliding his arm around her. To\nher, I'm merely a passionate savage.\n  \n \n  They went to his cabin.\n  \n \n  She sat down, smiling. Was she pretty? Maybe. For her own race, she\nwasn't tall, only by Terran standards. Her legs were disproportionately\nlong and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless,\nexcept for a thin, straight, short nose. It was her eyes that made\nthe difference, he decided. A notch or two up the scale of visual\ndevelopment, her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on\nthe violet end of the spectrum.\n  \n \n  She settled back and looked at him. \"It might be fun living with you on\nprimeval Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He said nothing; she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as\nher own world. She had something else in mind.\n  \n \n  \"I don't think I will, though. We might have children.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would it be wrong?\" he asked. \"I'm as intelligent as you. We wouldn't\nhave subhuman monsters.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be a step up\u2014for you.\" Under her calm, there was tension.\nIt had been there as long as he'd known her, but it was closer to the\nsurface now. \"Do I have the right to condemn the unborn? Should I make\nthem start lower than I am?\"\n  \n \n  The conflict was not new nor confined to them. In one form or another,\nit governed personal relations between races that were united against\nnon-humans, but held sharp distinctions themselves.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't asked you to marry me,\" he said bluntly.\n  \n \n  \"Because you're afraid I'd refuse.\"\n  \n \n  It was true; no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a\npermanent union.\n  \n \n  \"Why did you ever have anything to do with me?\" demanded Halden.\n  \n \n  \"Love,\" she said gloomily. \"Physical attraction. But I can't let it\nlead me astray.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not make a play for Kelburn? If you're going to be scientific\nabout it, he'd give you children of the higher type.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kelburn.\" It didn't sound like a name, the way she said it. \"I don't\nlike him and he wouldn't marry me.\"\n  \n \n  \"He wouldn't, but he'd give you children if you were humble enough.\nThere's a fifty per cent chance you might conceive.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool\nof scummy water.\n  \n \n  They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the\nCity Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of\nsome kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest\u2014and then crawled\ncrab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.\n  \n \n  He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he\nshuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the\nCity Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of\nthe building and halting for a moment before going on.\n  \n \n  Were there more of them?\n  \n \n  It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm\nweren't men. They were alien\u2014from some other world, some other\ndimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the\nuniverse. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm\nof being.\n  \n \n  On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved\ntoward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter\nthe City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.\n  \n \n  Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight,\nclutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly\nfluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and\ncame to rest among them.\n  \n \n  Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves\nas men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration.\nMimicry.\n  \n \n  Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The\nalley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe\ndarkness made no difference to them.\n  \n \n  He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and\nwomen flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting\ngroups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the\nevening gloom.\n  \n \n  Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the\nbus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A\nmoment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.\n  \n"

I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n  \n"

When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n  \n"

        "He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the\nmike. He got through to her.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, hello, darling,\" he whispered. \"Marsha, can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes. You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling.\nWhere you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she\nlooked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with\nMarsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of\nthat hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her,\nas he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren\nrocks.\n  \n \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,\n But down, my dear;\n And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley\n Will never seem fresh or clear\n For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\n In the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound\nof his own voice.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"\n  \n \n  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\"\nTerrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into\nany signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our\ndestiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and\nwe'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're\ngoing up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the\ntop, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a\nthousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this\nworld\u2014the top of\n   \n   everything\n   \n  . The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n  \n \n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n  \n \n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n  \n \n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n  \n \n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n  \n \n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  By BRYCE WALTON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by BOB HAYES\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction June 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   First one up this tallest summit in the Solar\n    \n   System was a rotten egg ... a very rotten egg!\n   \n \n \n \n  Bruce heard their feet on the gravel outside and got up reluctantly to\nopen the door for them. He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n  \n \n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n  \n \n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n  \n \n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n  \n \n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars\neight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never\ngot back to Earth\u2014all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow,\nlike little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.\n  \n \n  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher\nthan any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The\nentire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills\nby erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one\nincredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it\nhad seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at\nEarth\u2014or a warning one.\n  \n"

When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked toward the ugly red mound that jutted above the green. When\nthey came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains,\nactually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on\nwalking.\n  \n \n  \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that\nthere is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it,\neither, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is\ngiven an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the\nConquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had\nto.\"\n  \n \n  He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded\nhills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied\ntogether with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond\nthem were those from\n   \n   Mars V\n   \n  , too freshly dead to have decayed\nmuch ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and\nMarsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed\nto climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched\nout, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.\n  \n \n  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds,\nred elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve\nmiles from the ship\u2014horizontally.\n  \n \n  Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the\nfresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace\nbeside the canal.\n  \n \n  He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that\nother time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so\nmuch, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of\nHelene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently\nflowing water of the cool, green canal.\n  \n \n  \"You loved her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she\nwas young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd\nbeen older when they got her.\"\n  \n \n  He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the\nleaves floating down it.\n  \n \n  \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never\nseem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\nin the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n \n  He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm\ncity. He didn't look back.\n  \n \n  \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet\nI seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago.\nAre\u2014are the climbers still climbing\u2014somewhere, Helene?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe. I doubt if even the\nMartians have the answer to that.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the city.\n  \n \n"

You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling.\nWhere you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she\nlooked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with\nMarsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of\nthat hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her,\nas he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren\nrocks.\n  \n \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,\n But down, my dear;\n And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley\n Will never seem fresh or clear\n For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\n In the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound\nof his own voice.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"\n  \n \n  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\"\nTerrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into\nany signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our\ndestiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and\nwe'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're\ngoing up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the\ntop, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a\nthousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this\nworld\u2014the top of\n   \n   everything\n   \n  . The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n  \n \n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n  \n \n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain.\n  \n<doc-sep>Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip.\nLimping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings\nthey looked out on a strange and isolated world.\n  \n \n  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount\nTamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy\nwhite sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons\non a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding,\ntallest of the peaks and most forbidding.\n  \n \n  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold\u2014of all the kinds of\ngold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small\nportion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed\nto have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its\ncolor.\n  \n \n  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no\ninterest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes,\nRoddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.\n  \n \n  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which\nInvaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins\nof the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable\nover the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was\nthe advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on\nthe water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need\nto kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.\n  \n \n  Roddie took the hammer from his waist.\n  \n \n  \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her\nface with scratched and bloodied hands.\n  \n \n  Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and,\nweeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends.\nIda's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.\n  \n \n  \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will\ncome back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so\nsenseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your\nfriends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men\u2014and the\ncity is ours, not theirs!\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   can't\n   \n  be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those\nwho are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to\nme. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be\naimless. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and\nend it by destroying it.\n   \n   My\n   \n  people must be the true Men, because\nthey're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to\nlet you escape.\"\n  \n \n  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.\n  \n \n  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in\ncold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two?\nDon't\u2014don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"\n  \n \n  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet\nsomehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said\nnothing.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind!\" Ida said viciously. \"You can't make me beg. Go ahead and\nkill\u2014see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the\ncity regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack\nfriends, too! Men can accomplish anything!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n"

        "Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n  \n \n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n  \n \n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n  \n \n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n  \n<doc-sep>Terrence said, \"why did you shoot Doran?\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing me, and\nwhen he shot the\u2014\" Bruce hesitated.\n  \n \n  \"What? When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He stared at the radio. He hesitated, reached out and switched on the\nmike. He got through to her.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, hello, darling,\" he whispered. \"Marsha, can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes. You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling.\nWhere you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she\nlooked.

        " \n  Brightside\n   \n  Crossing\n  \n by Alan E. Nourse\n  \n  JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had\na visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He\nhad no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there\nwere pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman\nhad flagged him as he came in from the street: \u201cA thousand\npardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman\u2014he would leave no\nname. He said you\u2019d want to see him. He will be back by\neight.\u201d\n  \n \n  Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring\nabout the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the\nRed Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in\nnumber. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew\nvaguely\u2014Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over\nnear the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped\nthe first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron\nreturned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and\nwaited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time\nwithout justifying it.\n  \n \n  Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat\ndown at Baron\u2019s table. He was short and wiry. His face held\nno key to his age\u2014he might have been thirty or a thousand\u2014but\nhe looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and\nforehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still\nhealing.\n  \n \n  The stranger said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you waited. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re\nplanning to attempt the Brightside.\u201d\n  \n \n  Baron stared at the man for a moment. \u201cI see you can read\ntelecasts,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe news was correct. We are going\nto make a Brightside Crossing.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cAt perihelion?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course. When else?\u201d\n  \n \n  The grizzled man searched Baron\u2019s face for a moment\nwithout expression. Then he said slowly, \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re\nnot going to make the Crossing.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cSay, who are you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d Baron demanded.\n  \n \n  \u201cThe name is Claney,\u201d said the stranger.\n  \n \n  There was a silence. Then: \u201cClaney?\n   \n   Peter\n   \n  Claney?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n  \n \n  Baron\u2019s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger\ngone. \u201cGreat balls of fire, man\u2014\n   \n   where have you been hiding?\n   \n  We\u2019ve been trying to contact you for months!\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI know. I was hoping you\u2019d quit looking and chuck the\nwhole idea.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cQuit looking!\u201d Baron bent forward over the table. \u201cMy\nfriend, we\u2019d given up hope, but we\u2019ve never quit looking.\nHere, have a drink. There\u2019s so much you can tell us.\u201d His\nfingers were trembling.\n  \n \n  Peter Claney shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything you\nwant to hear.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cBut you\u2019ve\n   \n   got\n   \n  to. You\u2019re the only man on Earth who\u2019s\nattempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the\nstory you cleared for the news\u2014it was nothing. We need\n   \n   details\n   \n  . Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you\nmiscalculate? What were the trouble spots?\u201d Baron jabbed a\nfinger at Claney\u2019s face. \u201cThat, for instance\u2014epithelioma?\nWhy? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We\u2019ve\ngot to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make\nit across where your attempt failed\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYou want to know why we failed?\u201d asked Claney.\n  \n \n  \u201cOf course we want to know. We\n   \n   have\n   \n  to know.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s simple. We failed because it can\u2019t be done. We couldn\u2019t\ndo it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross\nthe Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNonsense,\u201d Baron declared. \u201cWe will.\u201d\n  \n \n  Claney shrugged. \u201cI was there. I know what I\u2019m saying. You\ncan blame the equipment or the men\u2014there were flaws in\nboth quarters\u2014but we just didn\u2019t know what we were fighting.\nIt was the\n   \n   planet\n   \n  that whipped us, that and the\n   \n   Sun\n   \n  . They\u2019ll\nwhip you, too, if you try it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cNever,\u201d said Baron.\n  \n \n  \u201cLet me tell you,\u201d Peter Claney said.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

But who was his enemy?\n  \n \n \n  In 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate was\nknown as fog. In 2149, it had become far more frequent, and was known\nas smog. By 2349, it was fog again.\n  \n \n  But tonight there was smoke mixed with the fog. Roddie could smell it.\nSomewhere in the forested ruins, fire was burning.\n  \n \n  He wasn't worried. The small blaze that smoldered behind him on the\ncracked concrete floor had consumed everything burnable within blocks;\nwhat remained of the gutted concrete office building from which he\npeered was fire-proof.\n  \n \n  But Roddie was himself aflame with anger. As always when Invaders broke\nin from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, while\nthe soldiers went out to fight.\n  \n \n  And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be. He felt\nalmost ready to jump out of his skin, the way she rocked and knitted in\nthat grating ruined chair, saying over and over again, \"The soldiers\ndon't\n   \n   want\n   \n  little boys. The soldiers don't\n   \n   want\n   \n  little boys. The\nsoldiers don't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\n   \n   not\n   \n  a little boy!\" Roddie suddenly shouted. \"I'm full-grown and\nI've never even\n   \n   seen\n   \n  an Invader. Why won't you let me go and fight?\"\n  \n \n  Fiercely he crossed the bare, gritty floor and shook Molly's shoulder.\nShe rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed the subject.\n  \n \n  \"A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, C is for Corpse\u2014\" she chanted.\n  \n \n  Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that had\nhelped her over these spells. But this time, though it stopped the\nkindergarten song, the treatment only started something worse.\n  \n \n  \"Wuzzums hungry?\" Molly cooed, still rocking.\n  \n \n  Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped her head off her neck.\n  \n \n  It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had\ncared for him and taught him speech and the alphabet hadn't made him a\nmechanic, and his only tool was a broken-handled screwdriver.\n  \n"

        "When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's\nassertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if\nshe felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of\nwhat the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an\nInvader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.\n  \n \n  Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.\n  \n \n  For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do\nany good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most\ndirect route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and\nshe began to talk.\n  \n \n  Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless\nto him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had\nbeen.\n  \n \n  \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many\ncasualties....\n  \n \n  \"But why do you\u2014we\u2014keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the\nsoldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and\nthey\n   \n   can't\n   \n  leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll\nbe plenty of young men.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever\ntell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep\nus out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our\ntools and things?\"\n  \n \n  She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance.\nBut she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too\nclose for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder\nevery few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.\n  \n \n  He went on with his questioning. \"Why are\n   \n   you\n   \n  here? I mean, sure, the\nothers are after tools and things, but what's\n   \n   your\n   \n  purpose?\"\n  \n \n  Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said,\n\"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no\nweapon.\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of\nwords. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored\nand hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the\nboats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was\nbeing silly?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\"\n  \n \n  In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and\nconcrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over\nthe water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they\ncould see the beginning of the bridge approach.\n  \n \n  A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and\nclung to Roddie's arm.\n  \n \n  \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\"\n  \n \n  He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back\nbelow the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a\nsoldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.\n  \n \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking.\n  \n \n  There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned\nand walked away.\n  \n \n  Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie\nturned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to\nhis. He grimaced and turned away his head.\n  \n \n  Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from\nhis arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've\nhad no sleep, no food or water.\"\n  \n \n  Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to\ndeny his own humiliating needs.\n  \n \n  \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care\nof you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\"\n  \n \n  Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he\nhad previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting\na pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had\ngrubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose.\nPicking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed\nan end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained\nspinach or squash.\n  \n \n  \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat\nbaby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you\nhappen to know where to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging.\n\"I've been here before.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did the soldier let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\"\n  \n \n  But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She\nwas silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can\nwith rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the\nrubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her\nstrength.\n  \n \n  And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed\nplainly that he'd given himself away.\n  \n \n  But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the\nsupposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as\nIda herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would\nsatisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he\nmight join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this\nenemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect\nhim.\n  \n \n  He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of\nhis watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder\nat every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for\nthis self-restraint. Here, difficult going demanded full attention.\n  \n<doc-sep>She had stopped, trembling and gasping. Roddie clung just below her\nand looked dazedly around. There was nothing in sight but fog, pierced\nby the rapier of rusted wire supporting them. Neither end of it was in\nsight.\n  \n \n  Upward lay success, if death were not nearer on the cable. No soldier\nhad ever come even this far, for soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never left\nthe city, were not built to do so. But\n   \n   he\n   \n  was here; with luck, he\ncould capitalize on the differences that had plagued him so long.\n  \n \n  \"Go on!\" he ordered hoarsely. \"Move!\"\n  \n \n  There was neither answer nor result. He broke off an end of loosened\nwire and jabbed her rear. Ida gasped and crawled on.\n  \n \n  Up and up they went, chilled, wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted.\nNever had Roddie felt so thoroughly the defects of his peculiar\nnon-mechanical construction.\n  \n \n  Without realizing it, he acquired a new purpose, a duty as compelling\nas that of any soldier or fire-watcher. He had to keep that trembling\nbody of his alive, mount to the tall rust tower overhead.\n  \n \n  He climbed and he made Ida climb, till, at nightmare's end, the fog\nthinned and they came into clear, windswept air and clawed up the last\nhundred feet to sanctuary.\n  \n \n  They were completely spent. Without word or thought they crept within\nthe tower, huddled together for warmth on its dank steel deck, and\nslept for several hours.\n  \n<doc-sep>He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n  \n \n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n  \n \n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n  \n \n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n  \n \n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n  \n \n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n  \n \n  Except it wouldn't be\n   \n   his\n   \n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n  \n \n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along\nthe top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve\nsteepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.\n  \n \n  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when\nhe'd followed.\n  \n \n  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would\nadmit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at\nevery downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only\nhis holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head.\n  \n"

He had to talk fast.\n  \n \n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"\n  \n \n  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even\nher own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there\n   \n   were\n   \n  a way over the bridge....\n  \n \n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"\n  \n \n  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed\nher\u2014\n   \n   if\n   \n  nothing happened when she saw him.\n  \n \n  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.\n  \n \n  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first\nup the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old\nthing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n  \n \n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n  \n \n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n  \n \n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n  \n \n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n  \n \n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n  \n \n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n  \n \n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>She had stopped, trembling and gasping.

        "Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready\nfor an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the\ndarkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over\nthat curving surface for identifying features.\n  \n \n  While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly\nseized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage\nkick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an\nunexpected voice.\n  \n \n  \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" it whispered angrily. \"Who do you think\nyou are?\"\n  \n \n  Startled, he dropped his hammer. \"I'm Roddie,\" he said, squatting to\nfumble for it. \"Who do you think\n   \n   you\n   \n  are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls\n   \n   are\n   \n  there in this raiding\nparty?\"\n  \n \n  His first Invader\u2014and he had dropped his weapon!\n  \n \n  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused\nsuddenly. This girl\u2014whatever\n   \n   that\n   \n  was\u2014seemed to think him one of\nher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn\ndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he\nkilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!\n  \n \n  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would\n   \n   I\n   \n  know how many girls there\nare?\"\n  \n \n  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.\nRoddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"\n  \n \n  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight\nwith fear of discovery.\n  \n \n  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper\nwas friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.\nThey shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't\nit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't\nhave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and\nrising. \"How did you get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the\ndust and they led me here. Where were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man\nwhen I came back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these\nandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"\n  \n \n  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find\nhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the\nmanhole would help him now to redeem himself....\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see\nme soon enough.\"\n  \n \n  But she'd see\n   \n   him\n   \n  , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.\n  \n \n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"\n  \n \n  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even\nher own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there\n   \n   were\n   \n  a way over the bridge....\n  \n \n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"\n  \n \n  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed\nher\u2014\n   \n   if\n   \n  nothing happened when she saw him.\n  \n \n  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.\n  \n \n  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first\nup the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old\nthing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n  \n \n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n  \n \n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n  \n \n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n  \n \n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n  \n \n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n  \n \n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n  \n \n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n  \n \n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n  \n \n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n  \n \n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n  \n \n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n  \n \n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n  \n \n  Except it wouldn't be\n   \n   his\n   \n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n  \n \n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along\nthe top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve\nsteepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.\n  \n \n  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when\nhe'd followed.\n  \n \n  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would\nadmit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at\nevery downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only\nhis holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head.\n  \n"

Then one day he saw\n  \n  it\n  \n hanging in the\ntown square.\n  \n  Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car\nout and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His\nback and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and\nwheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done\nokay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he\nliked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!\n  \n \n  It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying\ncommuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and\npackages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks\nand businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red\nlight and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;\nhe'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the\nrecords of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove\nslowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the\ntown park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again\nhe passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain\nand bench and single lamppost.\n  \n \n  From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,\nswinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled\ndown his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of\nsome kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n  \n \n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body. A human body.\n  \n"

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\n  \n \n  Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\n  \n \n  Michaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n  \n \n  \"For what?\"\n  \n \n  \"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n  \n \n  \"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\n  \n \n  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\n  \n \n  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n  \n \n  \"What about the book?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of book is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\n   \n   kind\n   \n  of book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\n  \n \n  The old man raised the gun.\n  \n"

        "Theodor rubbed his eyes and pushed his chair back from the table. \"We\nneed a break.\"\n  \n \n  Frieda agreed wearily. \"We've gone through everything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good idea,\" Edmund said briskly. \"I think we've hit on several crucial\npoints along the way and half disentangled them from the great mass of\ninconsequential material. I'll finish up that part of the job right now\nand present my case when we're all a bit fresher. Say half an hour?\"\n  \n \n  Theodor nodded heavily, pushing up from his chair and hitching his\ncloak over a shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going out for a drink,\" he informed them.\n  \n \n  After several hesitant seconds, Rosalind quietly followed him. Frieda\nstretched out on a couch and closed her eyes. Edmund scanned microfilms\ntirelessly, every now and then setting one aside.\n  \n \n  Celeste watched him for a minute, then sprang up and started toward the\nroom where Dotty was asleep. But midway she stopped.\n  \n \n \n   Not my child\n   \n  , she thought bitterly.\n   \n   Frieda's her mother, Rosalind\nher nurse. I'm nothing at all. Just one of the husband's girl friends.\nA lady of uneasy virtue in a dissolving world.\n   \n \n \n  But then she straightened her shoulders and went on.\n  \n<doc-sep>Rosalind and Ivan stared dumbly at each other across the egg-shaped\nsilver room, without apparent entrance or exit, in which they were\nsprawled. But their thoughts were no longer of thirty-odd mile\njourneys down through solid earth, or of how cool it was after the\nheat of the passage, or of how grotesque it was to be trapped here,\nthe fragment of a marriage. They were both listening to the voice that\nspoke inside their minds.\n  \n \n  \"In a few minutes your bodies will be separated into layers one atom\nthick, capable of being shelved or stored in such a way as to endure\nalmost infinite accelerations. Single cells will cover acres of space.\nBut do not be alarmed. The process will be painless and each particle\nwill be catalogued for future assembly. Your consciousness will endure\nthroughout the process.\"\n  \n \n  Rosalind looked at her gold-shod toes. She was wondering,\n   \n   will they go\nfirst, or my head? Or will I be peeled like an apple?\n   \n \n \n  She looked at Ivan and knew he was thinking the same thing.\n  \n<doc-sep>Rosalind didn't catch up with Theodor. Her footsteps were silent and\nhe never looked back along the path whose feeble white glow rose only\nknee-high, lighting a low strip of shrub and mossy tree trunk to either\nside, no more.\n  \n \n  It was a little chilly. She drew on her gloves, but she didn't hurry.\nIn fact, she fell farther and farther behind the dipping tail of\nhis scarlet cloak and his plodding red shoes, which seemed to move\ndisembodied, like those in the fairy tale.\n  \n \n  When she reached the point where she had found Ivan's briefcase, she\nstopped altogether.\n  \n \n  A breeze rustled the leaves, and, moistly brushing her cheek, brought\nforest scents of rot and mold. After a bit she began to hear the\nfurtive scurryings and scuttlings of forest creatures.\n  \n \n  She looked around her half-heartedly, suddenly realizing the futility\nof her quest. What clues could she hope to find in this knee-high\ntwilight? And they'd thoroughly combed the place earlier in the night.\n  \n \n  Without warning, an eerie tingling went through her and she was seized\nby a horror of the cold, grainy Earth underfoot\u2014an ancestral terror\nfrom the days when men shivered at ghost stories about graves and tombs.\n  \n \n  A tiny detail persisted in bulking larger and larger in her mind\u2014the\nunnaturalness of the way the Earth had impregnated the corner of Ivan's\nbriefcase, almost as if dirt and leather co-existed in the same space.\nShe remembered the queer way the partly buried briefcase had resisted\nher first tug, like a rooted plant.\n  \n \n  She felt cowed by the mysterious night about her, and literally\ndwarfed, as if she had grown several inches shorter. She roused herself\nand started forward.\n  \n \n  Something held her feet.\n  \n \n  They were ankle-deep in the path. While she looked in fright and\nhorror, they began to sink still lower into the ground.\n  \n \n  She plunged frantically, trying to jerk loose. She couldn't. She had\nthe panicky feeling that the Earth had not only trapped but invaded\nher; that its molecules were creeping up between the molecules of her\nflesh; that the two were becoming one.\n  \n \n  And she was sinking faster. Now knee-deep, thigh-deep, hip-deep,\nwaist-deep. She beat at the powdery path with her hands and threw her\nbody from side to side in agonized frenzy like some sinner frozen in\nthe ice of the innermost circle of the ancients' hell. And always the\nsense of the dark, grainy tide rose inside as well as around her.\n  \n \n  She thought,\n   \n   he'd just have had time to scribble that note on his\nbriefcase and toss it away.\n   \n  She jerked off a glove, leaned out as\nfar as she could, and made a frantic effort to drive its fingers into\nthe powdery path. Then the Earth mounted to her chin, her nose, and\ncovered her eyes.\n  \n \n  She expected blackness, but it was as if the light of the path stayed\nwith her, making a little glow all around. She saw roots, pebbles,\nblack rot, worn tunnels, worms. Tier on tier of them, her vision\npenetrating the solid ground. And at the same time, the knowledge that\nthese same sorts of things were coursing up through her.\n  \n"

After\n    \n   science, there will be ... what? The biggest,\n    \n   most staggering\n   \n  , most final\n   \n   fact of them all!\n   \n \n \n \n  \"But it's all predicted here! It even names this century for the next\nreshuffling of the planets.\"\n  \n \n  Celeste Wolver looked up unwillingly at the book her friend Madge\nCarnap held aloft like a torch. She made out the ill-stamped title,\n   \n   The Dance of the Planets\n   \n  . There was no mistaking the time of\nits origin; only paper from the Twentieth Century aged to that\nparticularly nasty shade of brown. Indeed, the book seemed to Celeste\na brown old witch resurrected from the Last Age of Madness to confound\na world growing sane, and she couldn't help shrinking back a trifle\ntoward her husband Theodor.\n  \n \n  He tried to come to her rescue. \"Only predicted in the vaguest way. As\nI understand it, Kometevsky claimed, on the basis of a lot of evidence\ndrawn from folklore, that the planets and their moons trade positions\nevery so often.\"\n  \n \n  \"As if they were playing Going to Jerusalem, or musical chairs,\"\nCeleste chimed in, but she couldn't make it sound funny.\n  \n \n  \"Jupiter was supposed to have started as the outermost planet, and is\nto end up in the orbit of Mercury,\" Theodor continued. \"Well, nothing\nat all like that has happened.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it's begun,\" Madge said with conviction. \"Phobos and Deimos have\ndisappeared. You can't argue away that stubborn little fact.\"\n  \n \n  That was the trouble; you couldn't. Mars' two tiny moons had simply\nvanished during a period when, as was generally the case, the eyes\nof astronomy weren't on them. Just some hundred-odd cubic miles of\nrock\u2014the merest cosmic flyspecks\u2014yet they had carried away with them\nthe security of a whole world.\n  \n<doc-sep>Edmund rapped the table to gain the family's attention. \"I'd say we've\ndone everything we can for the moment to find Ivan. We've made a\nthorough local search. A wider one, which we can't conduct personally,\nis in progress. All helpful agencies have been alerted and descriptions\nare being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business of the\nevening\u2014which may very well be connected with Ivan's disappearance.\"\n  \n \n  One by one the others nodded and took their places at the round table.\nCeleste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that\nhad engulfed her and focus attention on her microfilms.\n  \n \n  \"I'll take over Ivan's notes,\" she heard Edmund say. \"They're mainly\nabout the Deep Shaft.\"\n  \n \n  \"How far have they got with that?\" Frieda asked idly. \"Twenty-five\nmiles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nearer thirty, I believe,\" Edmund answered, \"and still going down.\"\n  \n \n  At those last two words they all looked up quickly. Then their eyes\nwent toward Ivan's briefcase.\n  \n"

        "Eight hours, three sandwiches and six beers later, Dan roused suddenly\nfrom a light doze and sat up on the cot. Between him and the crowded\nshelving, a palely luminous framework was materializing in mid-air.\n  \n \n  The apparition was an open-work cage\u2014about the size and shape of an\nout-house minus the sheathing, Dan estimated breathlessly. Two figures\nwere visible within the structure, sitting stiffly in contoured chairs.\nThey glowed, if anything, more brightly than the framework.\n  \n \n  A faint sound cut into the stillness\u2014a descending whine. The cage\nmoved jerkily, settling toward the floor. Long blue sparks jumped,\ncrackling, to span the closing gap; with a grate of metal, the cage\nsettled against the floor. The spectral men reached for ghostly\nswitches....\n  \n \n  The glow died.\n  \n \n  Dan was aware of his heart thumping painfully under his ribs. His mouth\nwas dry. This was the moment he'd been planning for, but now that it\nwas here\u2014\n  \n \n  Never mind. He took a deep breath, ran over the speeches he had\nprepared for the occasion:\n  \n \n \n   Greeting, visitors from the Future....\n   \n \n \n  Hopelessly corny. What about:\n   \n   Welcome to the Twentieth Century....\n   \n \n \n  No good; it lacked spontaneity. The men were rising, their backs to\nDan, stepping out of the skeletal frame. In the dim light it now\nlooked like nothing more than a rough frame built of steel pipe, with\na cluster of levers in a console before the two seats. And the thieves\nlooked ordinary enough: Two men in gray coveralls, one slender and\nbalding, the other shorter and round-faced. Neither of them noticed\nDan, sitting rigid on the cot. The thin man placed a lantern on the\ntable, twiddled a knob. A warm light sprang up. The visitors looked at\nthe stacked shelves.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like the old boy's been doing all right,\" the shorter man said.\n\"Fathead's gonna be pleased.\"\n  \n \n  \"A very gratifying consignment,\" his companion said. \"However, we'd\nbest hurry, Manny. How much time have we left on this charge?\"\n  \n \n  \"Plenty. Fifteen minutes anyway.\"\n  \n \n  The thin man opened a package, glanced at a painting.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, magnificent. Almost the equal of Picasso in his puce period.\"\n  \n \n  Manny shuffled through the other pictures in the stack.\n  \n \n  \"Like always,\" he grumbled. \"No nood dames. I like nood dames.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look at this, Manny! The textures alone\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Manny looked. \"Yeah, nice use of values,\" he conceded. \"But I still\nprefer nood dames, Fiorello.\"\n  \n \n  \"And this!\" Fiorello lifted the next painting. \"Look at that gay play\nof rich browns!\"\n  \n \n  \"I seen richer browns on Thirty-third Street,\" Manny said. \"They was\npopular with the sparrows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Manny, sometimes I think your aspirations\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Whatta ya talkin? I use a roll-on.\" Manny, turning to place a painting\nin the cage, stopped dead as he caught sight of Dan. The painting\nclattered to the floor. Dan stood, cleared his throat. \"Uh....\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh-oh,\" Manny said. \"A double-cross.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've\u2014ah\u2014been expecting you gentlemen,\" Dan said. \"I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you we couldn't trust no guy with nine fingers on each hand,\"\nManny whispered hoarsely. He moved toward the cage. \"Let's blow,\nFiorello.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute,\" Dan said. \"Before you do anything hasty\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't start nothing, Buster,\" Manny said cautiously. \"We're plenty\ntough guys when aroused.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want to talk to you,\" Dan insisted. \"You see, these paintings\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Paintings? Look, it was all a mistake. Like, we figured this was the\ngent's room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind, Manny,\" Fiorello cut in. \"It appears there's been a leak.\"\n  \n \n  Dan shook his head. \"No leak. I simply deduced\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Look, Fiorello,\" Manny said. \"You chin if you want to; I'm doing a\nfast fade.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't act hastily, Manny. You know where you'll end.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" Dan shouted. \"I'd like to make a deal with you\nfellows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah-hah!\" Kelly's voice blared from somewhere. \"I knew it! Slane, you\ncrook!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Miss Carroll looked at him for a long moment. \"Will what I tell you be\nused against him?\"\n  \n \n  \"There'll be nothing done against him, Miss Carroll ... unless it needs\nto be in the national interest.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure I know what the term 'national interest' means,\nJames. I distrust these glib phrases.\"\n  \n \n  \"I always liked Mr. Bram,\" said Tremaine. \"I'm not out to hurt him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Bram came here when I was a young woman. I'm not certain of the\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does he do for a living?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have no idea.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did a healthy young fellow like Bram settle out in that isolated\npiece of country? What's his story?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... not sure that anyone truly knows Bram's story.\"\n  \n \n  \"You called him 'Bram', Miss Carroll. Is that his first name ... or his\nlast?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is his only name. Just ... Bram.\"\n  \n \n  \"You knew him well once, Miss Carroll. Is there anything\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A tear rolled down Miss Carroll's faded cheek. She wiped it away\nimpatiently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm an unfulfilled old maid, James,\" she said. \"You must forgive me.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine stood up. \"I'm sorry. Really sorry. I didn't mean to grill\nyou. Miss Carroll. You've been very kind. I had no right....\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll shook her head. \"I knew you as a boy, James. I have\ncomplete confidence in you. If anything I can tell you about Bram will\nbe helpful to you, it is my duty to oblige you; and it may help him.\"\nShe paused. Tremaine waited.\n  \n \n  \"Many years ago I was courted by Bram. One day he asked me to go with\nhim to his house. On the way he told me a terrible and pathetic tale.\nHe said that each night he fought a battle with evil beings, alone, in\na cave beneath his house.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll drew a deep breath and went on. \"I was torn between pity\nand horror. I begged him to take me back. He refused.\" Miss Carroll\ntwisted her fingers together, her eyes fixed on the long past. \"When\nwe reached the house, he ran to the kitchen. He lit a lamp and threw\nopen a concealed panel. There were stairs. He went down ... and left me\nthere alone.\n  \n \n  \"I waited all that night in the carriage. At dawn he emerged. He tried\nto speak to me but I would not listen.\n  \n \n  \"He took a locket from his neck and put it into my hand. He told me to\nkeep it and, if ever I should need him, to press it between my fingers\nin a secret way ... and he would come. I told him that until he would\nconsent to see a doctor, I did not wish him to call. He drove me home.\nHe never called again.\"\n  \n \n  \"This locket,\" said Tremaine, \"do you still have it?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll hesitated, then put her hand to her throat, lifted a\nsilver disc on a fine golden chain. \"You see what a foolish old woman I\nam, James.\"\n  \n \n  \"May I see it?\"\n  \n \n  She handed the locket to him. It was heavy, smooth. \"I'd like to\nexamine this more closely,\" he said. \"May I take it with me?\"\n  \n \n  Miss Carroll nodded.\n  \n \n  \"There is one other thing,\" she said, \"perhaps quite meaningless....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd be grateful for any lead.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bram fears the thunder.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  As Tremaine walked slowly toward the lighted main street of Elsby a car\npulled to a stop beside him. Jess leaned out, peered at Tremaine and\nasked:\n  \n \n  \"Any luck, Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine shook his head. \"I'm getting nowhere fast. The Bram idea's a\ndud, I'm afraid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing about Bram. You know, he hasn't showed up yet. I'm getting\na little worried. Want to run out there with me and take a look around?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Just so I'm back by full dark.\"\n  \n \n  As they pulled away from the curb Jess said, \"Jimmy, what's this about\nState Police nosing around here? I thought you were playing a lone hand\nfrom what you were saying to me.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought so too, Jess. But it looks like Grammond's a jump ahead of\nme. He smells headlines in this; he doesn't want to be left out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the State cops could be mighty handy to have around. I'm\nwondering why you don't want 'em in. If there's some kind of spy ring\nworking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We're up against an unknown quantity. I don't know what's behind this\nand neither does anybody else. Maybe it's a ring of Bolsheviks ...\nand maybe it's something bigger. I have the feeling we've made enough\nmistakes in the last few years; I don't want to see this botched.\"\n  \n \n  The last pink light of sunset was fading from the clouds to the west as\nJess swung the car through the open gate, pulled up under the old trees\nbefore the square-built house. The windows were dark. The two men got\nout, circled the house once, then mounted the steps and rapped on the\ndoor. There was a black patch of charred flooring under the window, and\nthe paint on the wall above it was bubbled. Somewhere a cricket set up\na strident chirrup, suddenly cut off. Jess leaned down, picked up an\nempty shotgun shell. He looked at Tremaine. \"This don't look good,\" he\nsaid. \"You suppose those fool boys...?\"\n  \n \n  He tried the door. It opened. A broken hasp dangled. He turned to\nTremaine. \"Maybe this is more than kid stuff,\" he said. \"You carry a\ngun?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the car.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get it.\"\n  \n \n  Tremaine went to the car, dropped the pistol in his coat pocket,\nrejoined Jess inside the house. It was silent, deserted. In the kitchen\nJess flicked the beam of his flashlight around the room. An empty plate\nlay on the oilcloth-covered table.\n  \n \n  \"This place is empty,\" he said. \"Anybody'd think he'd been gone a week.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very cozy\u2014\" Tremaine broke off. A thin yelp sounded in the\ndistance.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting jumpy,\" said Jess. \"Dern hounddog, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  A low growl seemed to rumble distantly. \"What the devil's that?\"\nTremaine said.\n  \n \n  Jess shone the light on the floor. \"Look here,\" he said. The ring of\nlight showed a spatter of dark droplets all across the plank floor.\n  \n \n  \"That's blood, Jess....\" Tremaine scanned the floor. It was of broad\nslabs, closely laid, scrubbed clean but for the dark stains.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he cleaned a chicken. This is the kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a trail.\" Tremaine followed the line of drops across the floor.\nIt ended suddenly near the wall.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it. Jimmy?\"\n  \n \n  A wail sounded, a thin forlorn cry, trailing off into silence. Jess\nstared at Tremaine. \"I'm too damned old to start believing in spooks,\"\nhe said. \"You suppose those damn-fool boys are hiding here, playing\ntricks?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think.\" Tremaine said, \"that we'd better go ask Hull Gaskin a few\nquestions.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he\nheaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's\ncreation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the\nWest. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and\nnow, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.\n  \n \n  The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be\na knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her\ndreams and happiness must never be shattered.\n  \n \n  The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines\nof Long Island in the growing twilight.\n  \n \n  A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a\ncowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.\nHe had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about\nthem....\n  \n \n  He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!\n  \n \n"

        "Suddenly, he understood. And understanding brought not peace but the\ngreatest terror he'd ever known. He screamed, \"We're on....\" but the\nswitch was thrown and there was no more speech. For an hour. Then he\ngot out of the chair and said, \"Sure glad I took my wife's advice and\ncame to see you, Doctor Hamming. I feel better already, and after only\none.... What do you call these treatments?\"\n  \n \n  \"Diathermy,\" the little doctor muttered.\n  \n \n  Harry gave him a five-dollar bill. The doctor gave him two singles in\nchange. \"That's certainly reasonable enough,\" Harry said.\n  \n \n  The doctor nodded. \"There's a police officer in the hall. He'll drive\nyou home so there won't be any trouble with the travel regulations.\"\n  \n \n  Harry said, \"Thanks. Think we'll ever see the end of travel regulations\nand rationing and all the rest of the emergency?\"\n  \n \n  \"You will, Mr. Burr.\"\n  \n \n  Harry walked to the door.\n  \n \n  \"We're on an ark,\" the doctor said.\n  \n \n  Harry turned around, smiling. \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"A test, Mr. Burr. You passed it. Goodbye.\"\n  \n \n  Harry went home. He told Edna he felt just great! She said she'd been\nworried when an officer found Plum wandering on the road; she thought\nmaybe Harry had gone off somewhere and broken travel regulations.\n  \n \n  \"Me?\" he exclaimed, amazed. \"Break travel regulations? I'd as soon kill\na pig!\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\n  \n \n  I was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\n  \n \n  Kane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n  \n \n  \"Awake, huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n  \n \n  \"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your plan?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\n  \n \n  I grunted my disgust.\n  \n \n  \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n  \n \n  \"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Right.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n  \n \n  \"What remark?\"\n  \n \n  \"It said, '\n   \n   My\n   \n  masters will be displeased with\n   \n   me\n   \n  if you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They went through one of the doors on the right, into a windowless\nroom. A thin little man with bald head and frameless glasses was there,\nputting on a white coat. His veiny hands shook. He looked a hundred\nyears old. \"Where's Petey?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Pete's all right, Dad. Just leading a horse back to Burr's farm.\"\n  \n \n  The old man sighed. \"I didn't know what form it would take. I expected\none or two cases, but I couldn't predict whether it would be gradual or\nsudden, whether or not it would lead to violence.\"\n  \n \n  \"No violence, Dad.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, Stan.\" He looked at Harry. \"I'm going to give you a little\ntreatment, Mr. Burr. It'll settle your nerves and make everything....\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to Davie?\" Harry asked, things pushing at his brain\nagain.\n  \n \n  Stan helped him up. \"Just step this way, Mr. Burr.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't resist. He went through the second door into the room with\nthe big chair. He sat down and let them strap his arms and legs and let\nthem lower the metal thing over his head. He felt needles pierce his\nscalp and the back of his neck. He let them do what they wanted; he\nwould let them kill him if they wanted. All he asked was one answer so\nas to know whether or not he was insane.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to my son Davie?\"\n  \n \n  The old man walked across the room and examined what looked like the\ninsides of a dozen big radios. He turned, his hand on a switch.\n  \n \n  \"Please,\" Harry whispered. \"Just tell me about my son.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor blinked behind his glasses, and then his hand left the\nswitch. \"Dead,\" he said, his voice a rustling of dried leaves. \"Like so\nmany millions of others. Dead, when the bombs fell. Dead, as everyone\nknew they would be and no one did anything to prevent. Dead. Perhaps\nthe whole world is dead\u2014except for us.\"\n  \n \n  Harry stared at him.\n  \n"

Then he checked to see that Edna had fed the chickens right.\nThey had only a dozen or so now.\n  \n \n  When had he sold the rest? And when had he sold his other livestock?\n  \n \n  Or had they died somehow? A rough winter? Disease?\n  \n \n  He stood in the yard, a tall, husky man with pale brown hair and a face\nthat had once been long, lean and strong and was now only long and\nlean. He blinked gray eyes and tried hard to remember, then turned and\nwent to the house. Edna was soaking dishes in the sink, according to\nregulations\u2014one sinkful of dishwater a day. And one tub of bath water\ntwice a week.\n  \n \n  She was looking at him. He realized his anger and confusion must be\nshowing. He managed a smile. \"You remember how much we got for our\nlivestock, Edna?\"\n  \n \n  \"Same as everyone else,\" she said. \"Government agents paid flat rates.\"\n  \n \n  He remembered then, or thought he did. The headache was back. He went\nupstairs and slept again, but this time he had dreams, many of them,\nand all confused and all frightening. He was glad to get up. And he was\nglad to hear Walt and Gloria talking to Edna downstairs.\n  \n \n  He washed his face, combed his hair and went down. Walt and Gloria were\nsitting on the sofa, Edna in the blue armchair. Walt was saying he'd\ngotten the new TV picture tube he'd ordered. \"Found it in the supply\nbin this morning. Spent the whole day installing it according to the\nbook of directions.\"\n  \n \n  Harry said hi and they all said hi and he sat down and they talked\nabout TV and gardens and livestock. Then Harry said, \"How's Penny?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine,\" Gloria answered. \"I'm starting her on the kindergarten book\nnext week.\"\n  \n \n  \"She's five already?\" Harry asked.\n  \n \n  \"Almost six,\" Walt said. \"Emergency Education Regulations state that\nthe child should be five years nine months old before embarking on\nkindergarten book.\"\n  \n \n  \"And Frances?\" Harry asked. \"Your oldest? She must be starting\nhigh....\" He stopped, because they were all staring at him, and because\nhe couldn't remember Frances clearly. \"Just a joke,\" he said, laughing\nand rising. \"Let's eat. I'm starved.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  BREAKDOWN\n  \n \n  By HERBERT D. KASTLE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by COWLES\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine June 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n  He didn't know exactly when it had started, but it had been going on\nfor weeks. Edna begged him to see the doctor living in that new house\ntwo miles past Dugan's farm, but he refused. He point-blank refused to\nadmit he was sick\n   \n   that\n   \n  way\u2014in the head!\n  \n \n  Of course, a man could grow forgetful. He had to admit there were\nmoments when he had all sorts of mixed-up memories and thoughts in his\nmind. And sometimes\u2014like right now, lying in bed beside Edna, watching\nthe first hint of light touch the windows\u2014he began sweating with fear.\nA horrible, gut-wrenching fear, all the more horrible because it was\nbased on nothing.\n  \n \n  The chicken-run came alive; the barn followed minutes later. There were\nchores to do, the same chores he'd done all his forty-one years. Except\nthat now, with the new regulations about wheat and corn, he had only\na vegetable patch to farm. Sure, he got paid for letting the fields\nremain empty. But it just didn't seem right, all that land going to\nwaste....\n  \n \n \n   Davie. Blond hair and a round, tanned face and strong arms growing\nstronger each day from helping out after school.\n   \n \n \n  He turned and shook Edna. \"What happened to Davie?\"\n  \n \n  She cleared her throat, mumbled, \"Huh? What happened to who?\"\n  \n \n  \"I said, what....\" But then it slipped away. Davie? No, that was part\nof a dream he'd had last week. He and Edna had no children.\n  \n \n  He felt the fear again, and got up fast to escape it. Edna opened her\neyes as soon as his weight left the bed. \"Like hotcakes for breakfast?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eggs,\" he said. \"Bacon.\" And then, seeing her face change, he\nremembered. \"Course,\" he muttered. \"Can't have bacon. Rationed.\"\n  \n \n  She was fully awake now. \"If you'd only go see Dr. Hamming, Harry. Just\nfor a checkup. Or let me call him so he could\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You stop that! You stop that right now, and for good! I don't want to\nhear no more about doctors. I get laid up, I'll call one. And it won't\nbe that Hamming who I ain't never seen in my life! It'll be Timkins,\nwho took care'n us and brought our son into the world and....\"\n  \n \n  She began to cry, and he realized he'd said something crazy again. They\nhad no son, never had a son. And Timkins\u2014he'd died and they'd gone to\nhis funeral. Or so Edna said.\n  \n \n  He himself just couldn't remember it.\n  \n \n  He went to the bed and sat down beside her. \"Sorry. That was just a\ndream I had. I'm still half asleep this morning. Couldn't fall off last\nnight, not till real late. Guess I'm a little nervous, what with all\nthe new regulations and not working regular. I never meant we had a\nson.\" He waited then, hoping she'd say they\n   \n   had\n   \n  had a son, and he'd\ndied or gone away. But of course she didn't.\n  \n"

A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why defeated?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort. A telephone pole\u2014and a rope! \"Right this way,\"\nthe Commissioner said, smiling coldly.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Name?\" the cop with the notebook murmured.\n  \n \n  \"Loyce.\" He mopped his forehead wearily. \"Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me.\nBack there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Address?\" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through\ntraffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the\nseat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.\n  \n \n  \"1368 Hurst Road.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's here in Pikeville?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. \"Listen\nto me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Where were you today?\" the cop behind the wheel demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Where?\" Loyce echoed.\n  \n \n  \"You weren't in your shop, were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\" He shook his head. \"No, I was home. Down in the basement.\"\n  \n \n  \"In the\n   \n   basement\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame.\nWhy? What has that to do with\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Was anybody else down there with you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.\" Loyce looked from\none heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flicked across his face, wild hope.\n\"You mean because I was down there I missed\u2014the explanation? I didn't\nget in on it? Like everybody else?\"\n  \n \n  After a pause the cop with the notebook said: \"That's right. You missed\nthe explanation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then it's official? The body\u2014it's\n   \n   supposed\n   \n  to be hanging there?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see.\"\n  \n \n  Ed Loyce grinned weakly. \"Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep\nend. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like\nthe Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  By BRYCE WALTON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by BOB HAYES\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction June 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   First one up this tallest summit in the Solar\n    \n   System was a rotten egg ... a very rotten egg!\n   \n \n \n \n  Bruce heard their feet on the gravel outside and got up reluctantly to\nopen the door for them. He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n  \n \n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n  \n \n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n  \n \n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n  \n \n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars\neight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never\ngot back to Earth\u2014all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow,\nlike little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.\n  \n \n  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher\nthan any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The\nentire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills\nby erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one\nincredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it\nhad seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at\nEarth\u2014or a warning one.\n  \n"

(Maybe the\nfire inspector had planted a few traces to make his explanation more\ncreditable.)\n  \n \n  The second item was further over in a science column just off the\neditorial page. It told of the government\u2014!\u2014developing a new process\nof waste disposal rivaling the old Buck Rogers disintegrator ray.\n  \n \n  This, I presumed, was one of Tony Carmen's information leaks.\n  \n \n  If he hoped to arouse the public into demanding my invention I\ndoubted he would succeed. The public had been told repeatedly of a\nnew radioactive process for preserving food and a painless way of\nspraying injections through the skin. But they were still stuck with\nrefrigerators and hypodermic needles.\n  \n \n  I had forced my way half-way through the paper and the terrible coffee\nI made when the doorbell rang.\n  \n \n  I was hardly surprised when it turned out to be Tony Carmen behind the\nfront door.\n  \n \n  He pushed in, slapping a rolled newspaper in his palm. \"Action,\nProfessor.\"\n  \n \n  \"The district attorney has indicted you?\" I asked hopefully.\n  \n \n  \"He's not even indicted\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Venetti. No, I got a feeler on this\nplant in the\n   \n   Times\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"The government will take over the invention, no\nmatter what the public wants.\"\n  \n \n  \"The public? Who cares about the public? The Arcivox corporation wants\nthis machine of yours. They have their agents tracing the plant now.\nThey will go from the columnist to his legman to my man and finally to\nyou. Won't be long before they get here. An hour maybe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arcivox makes radios and TV sets. What do they want with the\nExpendables?\"\n  \n \n  \"Opening up a new appliance line with real innovations.

The Ruler looked, in his frowning\nmanner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been\nadjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now\ncontinue.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough\nto him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than\nanyone else could know it.

As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying\nalive.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race!

Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n  \n<doc-sep>A station wagon came up behind them, slowed, and matched its speed\nwith theirs. \"Someone's following us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"Probably Jilka.\"\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the station wagon turned down a side street and\ndisappeared. \"She's no longer with us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"She's got to pick someone up. She'll meet us later.\"\n  \n \n  \"At your folks'?\"\n  \n \n  \"At the ship.\"\n  \n \n  The city was thinning out around them now, and a few stars were visible\nin the night sky. Quidley watched them thoughtfully for a while. Then:\n\"What ship?\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The one we're going to\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  on.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Fieu Dayol?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Persei 17 to you. I said I was going to take you home to meet my\nfolks, didn't I?\"\n  \n \n  \"In other words, you're kidnapping me.\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head vehemently. \"I most certainly am not! Neither\naccording to interstellar law or your own. When you compromised me, you\nmade yourself liable in the eyes of both.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why pick on me? There must be plenty of men on\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  . Why\ndon't you marry one of them?\"\n  \n \n  \"For two reasons: one, you're the particular man who compromised\nme. Two, there are\n   \n   not\n   \n  plenty of men on\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  . Our race is\nidentical to yours in everything except population-balance between the\nsexes. At periodic intervals the women on\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  so greatly\noutnumber the men that those of us who are temperamentally and\nemotionally unfitted to become spinsters have to look for\n   \n   wotnids\n   \n  \u2014or\nmates\u2014on other worlds. It's quite legal and quite respectable. As a\nmatter of fact, we even have schools specializing in alien cultures\nto expedite our activities. Our biggest problem is the Interstellar\nstatute forbidding us the use of local communications services and\nforbidding us to appear in public places. It was devised to facilitate\nthe prosecution of interstellar black marketeers, but we're subject to\nit, too, and have to contrive communications systems of our own.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why were all the messages addressed to you?\"\n  \n \n  \"They weren't messages. They were requisitions.

YOUNG\n  \n \n  They were lovely and quick\n   \n  to learn\u2014and their only\n   \n  faults were little ones!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old\nbooks had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue.\nNot that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n  \n<doc-sep>A station wagon came up behind them, slowed, and matched its speed\nwith theirs. \"Someone's following us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"Probably Jilka.\"\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the station wagon turned down a side street and\ndisappeared. \"She's no longer with us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"She's got to pick someone up.

He could hardly wait till the next\nmessage transfer took place.\n  \n \n  He decided to spend the evening plotting the epic novel which he\nintended to write someday. He set to work immediately. He plotted\nmentally, of course\u2014notes were for the hacks and the other commercial\nnon-geniuses who infested the modern literary world. Closing his eyes,\nhe saw the whole vivid panorama of epic action and grand adventure\nflowing like a mighty and majestic river before his literary vision:\nthe authentic and awe-inspiring background; the hordes of colorful\ncharacters; the handsome virile hero, the compelling Helenesque\nheroine.... God, it was going to be great! The best thing he'd ever\ndone! See, already there was a crowd of book lovers in front of the\nbookstore, staring into the window where the new Herbert Quidley was\non display, trying to force its way into the jammed interior....\n   \n   Cut\nto interior.\n   \n  FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell me quickly, are there any\nmore copies of the new Herbert Quidley left? BOOK CLERK: A few. You\ndon't know how lucky you are to get here before the first printing ran\nout. FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Give me a dozen. I want to make sure that\nmy children and my children's children have a plentiful supply. BOOK\nCLERK: Sorry. Only one to a customer. Next? SECOND EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell\nme quickly, are ... there ... any ... more ... copies ... of\u2014\n  \n \n  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ....\n  \n \n  Message no. 4, except for a slight variation in camouflage, ran true to\nform:\n  \n \n \n   a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj Cai: Habe te snoll dopers ensing?\nWotnid ne Fieu Dayol ist ifederereret, hid jestig snoll doper. Gind\ned, olro\u2014Jilka. a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj\n   \n \n \n  Quidley sighed. What, he asked himself, standing in the library aisle\nand staring at the indecipherable words, was a normal girl like Kay\ndoing in such a childish secret society? From the way she and her\ncorrespondents carried on you'd almost think they were Martian girl\nscouts on an interplanetary camping trip, trying for their merit badges\nin communications!\n  \n \n  You could hardly call Kay a girl scout, though.\n  \n \n  Nevertheless, she was the key figure in the\n   \n   snoll-doper\n   \n  enigma. The\nfact annoyed him, especially when he considered that a\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  ,\nfor all he knew, could be anything from a Chinese fortune cooky to an\nH-bomb.\n  \n \n  He remembered Kay's odd accent. Was that the way a person would speak\nEnglish if her own language ran something like \"\n   \n   ist ifedereret, hid\njestig snoll doper adwo\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He remembered the way she had looked at him in the coffee bar.\n  \n \n  He remembered the material of her dress.\n  \n \n  He remembered how she had come to his room.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't know you had a taste for Taine.\"\n  \n"
    ],
    [
        "In telling him that she would be in town two nights hence, Kay had\nunwittingly apprised him that there would be no exchange of messages\nuntil that time, so the next evening he skipped his vigil at the\nlibrary. The following evening, however, after readying his apartment\nfor the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table\npost and took up\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  once again.\n  \n \n  He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman.\n  \n \n  And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and\ngraceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy\nsection now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the\nliterature aisle and toward the T's....\n  \n \n  The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough:\n  \n \n \n   fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind\nen snoll doper nckli!

Dep gogensplo snoll dopers ensing!\u2014Gorka. fdsa\njkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl;\n   \n \n \n  Judging from the repeated use of the words,\n   \n   snoll dopers\n   \n  were the\ntopic of the day. Annoyed, Quidley replaced the message and put the\nbook back on the shelf. Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay.\n  \n \n  He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what\na\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur\nsecret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged.\nIt virtually had to be an amateur secret society. Unless, of course,\nthey were foreigners. But what on earth foreign organization would be\nquixotic enough to employ Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  as a\ncommunications medium when there was a telephone in every drugstore and\na mailbox on every corner?\n  \n \n  Somehow the words \"what on earth foreign organization\" got turned\naround in his mind and became \"what foreign organization on earth\" and\nbefore he could summon his common sense to succor him, he experienced\na rather bad moment. By the time the door chimes sounded he was his\nnormal self again.\n  \n \n  He straightened his tie with nervous fingers, checked to see if his\nshirt cuffs protruded the proper length from his coat sleeves, and\nlooked around the room to see if everything was in place. Everything\nwas\u2014the typewriter uncovered and centered on the chrome-trimmed desk,\nwith the sheaf of crinkly first-sheets beside it; the reference books\nstacked imposingly nearby;\n   \n   Harper's\n   \n  ,\n   \n   The Atlantic\n   \n  and\n   \n   The Saturday\nReview\n   \n  showing conspicuously in the magazine rack; the newly opened\nbottle of bourbon and the two snifter glasses on the sideboard; the\nsmall table set cozily for two\u2014\n  \n<doc-sep>Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend\nturned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of\nher own.

There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger\u2014and horror.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n"

Well, you're\nright about that. We didn't seek the spaceways for the advancement of\ncivilization or any of that Foundation bushwah, you can be certain of\nthat. We did it for\n   \n   us\n   \n  ... for Number One. That's the kind of men we\nwere, and we were proud of it. We hung onto what we found because the\nrisks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there.\nBut there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to\nall of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger\u2014and horror.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk\u2014the Ghost will come\u2014for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n  \n"

        "A slight sound behind me made me spin around in my chair. Framed in the\ndoorway was the heavy figure of my Third Officer, Spinelli. His black\neyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table.\nHe needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to me\nthat his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear was\nthe meaning of the expression on his heavy face.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Spinelli!\" I snapped, \"In the future knock before entering my\nquarters!\"\n  \n \n  Reluctantly his eyes left the lump of gold and met mine. \"From the\nderelict, Captain?\" There was an imperceptible pause between the last\ntwo words.\n  \n \n  I ignored his question and made a mental note to keep a close hand on\nthe rein with him. Spinelli was big and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Speak your piece, Mister,\" I ordered sharply.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn reports the derelict ready to take aboard the prize\ncrew ... sir,\" he said slowly. \"I'd like to volunteer for that detail.\"\n  \n \n  I might have let him go under ordinary circumstances, for he was a\nfirst class spaceman and the handling of a jury-rigged hulk would\nneed good men. But the gold-hunger I had seen in his eyes warned me\nto beware. I shook my head. \"You will stay on board the Maid with me,\nSpinelli. Cohn and Zaleski will handle the starship.\"\n  \n \n  Stark suspicion leaped into his eyes. I could see the wheels turning\nslowly in his mind. Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheat\nhim of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.\n  \n \n  \"We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, Mister\nSpinelli,\" I said deliberately, \"Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Is\nthat clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye, sir,\" murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his face\nand there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as he\nturned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't like\nhim to let it go at that.\n  \n \n  Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn't\nfunctioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. I\nrubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wondering\nabout Spinelli.\n  \n \n  Spinelli talked. I saw him murmuring something to big Zaleski, and\nafter that there was tension in the air. Distrust.\n  \n \n  For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threat\nto clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the first\nplace I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in the\nsecond place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid.\n  \n \n  I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, and\nI was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it that\nthere was no double-cross.\n  \n \n  I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned the\nrest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk.\nThat way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with the\ntreasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that they\nwere to be handling a vessel practically made of gold.\n  \n \n  I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight with\nthat starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave the Maid. Finally\nI had to let Cohn take command of the prize crew, but not before I had\nset the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname.
