Roy Walton, Popeek\u2019s assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself each morning as he enters the hideous place. Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on the twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham\u2019's\u2014but that had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant building. It couldn\u2019t be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though necessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the Bureau did not rate attractive quarters. So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that trimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed the massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines of Long Island in the growing twilight. A new plot was growing in the beginnings of the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a cowboy suddenly transported to another world. He had seen those other worlds.

The Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its local clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a certificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a certificate... and life. Walton does not like that, but there was nothing he could do about it. He would have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose. He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothing the crinkly paper carefully, and read it.

Looks like a tragic slip-up at one of the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets out. Walton shuddered, but some of them seemed to understand.

    "The story is set on the planet Fieu Dayol. The story begins with Quidley in the library of the planet Taine, where he is reading a book about the history of English literature. He finds a yellow paper on the shelf of the library, which he believes to be a copy of a book that was written by Hippolyte Adolphe Taine. The paper is in the form of a sheet of yellow copy paper folded in four, and it contains a series of letters and numbers. It is written in the same way that Taine\u2019s tome is written, but it is not written in any other language. This is significant because it is the first time he has ever seen the yellow paper in his life, and the only time he had ever seen it before was when he was a child. The yellow paper is also important because it reveals the identity of the girl he is looking for. The girl is a girl named Yoolna, and she is the daughter of a high-school typing student named Taine and a young girl named Jilka. She is described as tall and lissome, lovely with a lissom air of her own. She has a Grecian symmetry of shape that would have made Paris\u2019 eyes pop had he been around to take notice of it, and her eyes do the job of making him pop out of his shell. After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's desk and headed for the literature section. She takes a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine's History reposed, take the volume down, surreptitiously slip a folded sheet of Yellow paper between its pages and return it to the shelves. After she leaves, he follows her out of the door and follows her through the streets of the city. When she comes to the O's she pauses, takes down a book and looks through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the P's, replacing it and moving on to P's... the Q's...the R's. Barely three feet from him she pauses again and takes down the R's. The odds against two persons taking an interest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library were ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the volume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it with the air of a seasoned browser. He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the book to the library and went back to the reading table and The Zeitgeist. He had just taken down Xenophon's Anabasis when he saw the girl walk in the room. She employed the same tactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by chance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same undetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out the room, he was not far behind her. She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It took him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her. When, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an all-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a matter of following her inside.",
