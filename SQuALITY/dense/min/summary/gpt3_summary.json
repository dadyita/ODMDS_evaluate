She suggests he ask Swarts for more information.", "In the story \"Appointment in Tomorrow,\" Maizie holds significant importance as a highly advanced brain-machine. Maizie is capable of processing complex questions and providing answers with ease. Unlike other brain-machines, Maizie does not require translation into mathematical shorthand and can understand both technical jargon and layman's language. This ability sets Maizie apart and makes it an invaluable tool for the high officials who rely on its expertise.\n\nThe story emphasizes the power and influence of the Thinkers, the creators of Maizie. The President's Secretary, while apprehensive about the Thinkers' control over the Administration, acknowledges that doing business with them is still possible. However, Maizie stands out as an exception. It is implied that Maizie operates independently and cannot be influenced or manipulated by anyone, including the Thinkers. This uniqueness and autonomy make Maizie highly sought after and respected by the officials.\n\nFurthermore, Maizie's thinking process is described as a profound and steady purring, which commands respect and awe from those present. It is evident that Maizie's capabilities are far beyond the comprehension of ordinary individuals, including the high-ranking officials who rely on it for answers to complex questions.\n\nDespite Maizie's significance, there is a hint of dissatisfaction among some officials. The Secretary of Space, for example, feels excluded from the development of the first spaceship equipped with Maizie-designed nuclear motors. However, the story also highlights the gratitude of the officials towards the Thinkers for their mental science discoveries and the rescue of the Administration from collapse. The Thinkers' ability to contact Martians and bring back their mental skills is mentioned, although it is emphasized that Earth minds are not yet ready to interact with the Martians due to their extreme sensitivity.\n\nIn a separate part of the story, a fat man is shown operating Maizie, responding to questions and taping out answers. When confronted with the question of whether Maizie stands for Maelzel, the fat man's reaction becomes intense. He begins to tape an answer but does not deny the connection between Maizie and Maelzel. His snarling lips suggest a hidden significance or possibly a secret behind the name Maizie.\n\nIn summary, Maizie holds great significance in \"Appointment in Tomorrow\" as an advanced brain-machine capable of processing complex questions and providing answers effortlessly. Its independence and ability to understand various languages and jargon make it highly valuable to the officials. The story also hints at the power and influence of the Thinkers, as well as the potential secrets surrounding Maizie and its connection to Maelzel.", "In the story \"Appointment in Tomorrow\" by Fritz Leiber, the Thinkers play a significant role in society. The protagonist, Willard Farquar, expresses his concerns about the Thinkers and their influence on society. He believes that their power is based on bluff and manipulation rather than actual knowledge or abilities.\n\nHowever, Opperly, an older man and a physicist, offers a different perspective. He compares the Thinkers to historical figures like Isaac Newton and Adolf Hitler, suggesting that their power is not solely based on what they possess, but on what the world lacks - peace, honor, and a good conscience. Opperly implies that the Thinkers provide a sense of comfort and guidance to a society that is morally and ethically compromised.\n\nThe Thinkers are described as having clever stage-managing skills, using tactics such as faith-healing, science hocus-pocus, and even the belief in \"Martian wisdom\" to maintain their power. They have even influenced the outcome of a presidential election through their manipulation. However, Farquar believes that their power is precarious and vulnerable, and he plans to challenge them.\n\nThe significance of the Thinkers lies in their ability to shape and control society. They offer a sense of direction and purpose to a world that has lost its moral compass. Whether their influence is based on true knowledge or mere deception is a matter left to history. However, their impact on society cannot be denied.\n\nOverall, the Thinkers in \"Appointment in Tomorrow\" represent a force that provides guidance and stability to a world in chaos, even if their methods are questionable. Their influence raises questions about the nature of power and the role of moral values in society.", "In the story, Farquar is a character who impacts the plot of \"Appointment in Tomorrow\" by being a source of conflict and tension. Opperly, another character, brings up Farquar's past relationship with Miss Arkady and suggests that she left him for a Thinker. This revelation seems to unsettle Farquar, and he becomes defensive, questioning the relevance of his past relationship to the invitation he has received.\n\nOpperly then reflects on the changing role of scientists and the temptations they face in the modern world. Farquar interprets Opperly's comments as an implication that the Thinkers may try to manipulate or persuade him. However, Opperly clarifies that he does not think Farquar will change his aims.\n\nFarquar expresses his strong opposition to the Thinkers and their power, believing that they rely on bluffing and manipulation rather than genuine knowledge or wisdom. He predicts that the Thinkers will eventually seek help from him and others who oppose them.\n\nOpperly brings up Hitler as an example of someone who initially relied on bluff and deception but still achieved success. He also suggests that the power of the Thinkers is based on the absence of peace, honor, and a good conscience in the world.\n\nLater, Farquar receives a radiogram from Helmuth, inviting him to an event. Opperly expresses concern about potential dangers or harm that the Thinkers might inflict upon Farquar. However, Farquar is not afraid for his life and is more focused on the potential actions the Thinkers might take against him.\n\nIn another scene, Jorj Helmuth and the Secretary of Space discuss a question about Maelzel, which came from Opperly's group. The Secretary of Space mentions that Farquar is part of this group, leading Jorj to question Opperly's motives and suggest an investigation.\n\nIn summary, Farquar impacts the plot by being a character who opposes the Thinkers and their power. His personal history and beliefs create tension and conflict in the story, and his involvement with Opperly's group raises suspicions and prompts further investigation.", "In the story \"Appointment in Tomorrow,\" Opperly and Farquar have both similarities and differences. Opperly, with his gentle appraisal of Farquar, recognizes the latter's strength and vitality as a man. They both have a shared history, as Opperly brings up the past relationship between Farquar and a girl named Miss Arkady, who eventually left him for a Thinker. However, while Opperly reminisces about the past and the relatively easier life of scientists in his time, Farquar is more focused on the present and the challenges they face, particularly with the Thinkers.\n\nWhere they differ is in their approaches and perspectives. Opperly believes that scientists should not be involved in violence or react to the threats they face but rather should stay clear of the infection of violence. He acknowledges the power of magicians, who tell people what they wish were true, but also warns of the dangers of selling their souls for magic cures. On the other hand, Farquar is more inclined towards taking action and chipping away at the Thinkers. He believes that scientists should have formed a secret league and used their bargaining position to shape mankind's future. Farquar even expresses his readiness for violence, contrasting with Opperly's belief that violence is not the solution.\n\nIn terms of their relationship, Opperly seems to have a more contemplative and resigned attitude, having gone through different stages of fear, anger, and despair in the past. Farquar, on the other hand, is more passionate and eager to challenge the Thinkers and their control.\n\nOverall, while Opperly and Farquar share a common history and concern over the role of scientists in society, they differ in their approaches to addressing the challenges they face. Opperly emphasizes the need to avoid violence and focus on the truth, while Farquar believes in taking more assertive action to shape the future.", "In the story \"His Master's Voice\" by Walter M. Miller Jr., the main conflict revolves around the protagonist, Mr. Oak, inadvertently sabotaging the robot MGYR-7, also known as McGuire. Mr. Oak was commissioned to prevent sabotage, but his actions ended up causing more damage than anticipated. The conflict is further exacerbated by the fact that McGuire was constructed in a way that the first person to address orders to it would become its master. As Mr. Oak was the first person to speak to McGuire after its activation, he becomes its master.\n\nThe resolution of the conflict is not explicitly stated in the provided story. However, based on the context and the mention of Mr. Oak causing trouble and Ravenhurst wanting him to rectify the damage, it can be inferred that the resolution may involve Mr. Oak finding a way to undo or mitigate the sabotage he inadvertently caused to McGuire. The story ends before the resolution is revealed, leaving the reader to imagine the outcome.", "In the story \"His Master's Voice,\" Daniel Oak is a Confidential Expediter who works for the Political Survey Division branch of the System Census Bureau for the UN government. His job is to help other people get things done and his typical role is to hire the best test pilots for spaceship testing. However, in this particular story, he is assigned to a special case involving the McGuire project.\n\nThe McGuire project is the development of a complex robot who is in command of a spacecraft. Unlike other robots, McGuire is mobile and capable of making decisions in real-time. The Political Survey Division is interested in this project because it involves the Secret Service of the UN Government. Oak's role is to evaluate the political activities of various sub-governments in the System.\n\nAs for the use of flitterboats for transportation between Belts, Oak explains that full-sized spaceships are impractical due to economic reasons. Flitterboats, equipped with a single gravitoinertial engine and the necessities of life, are used for individual transportation in the Belt. However, they can only be used for short distances since a person cannot stay in a vac suit for too long without discomfort. Therefore, flitterboats are used to hop from beacon to beacon in the Belt.\n\nIn summary, Oak's job as a Confidential Expediter involves helping others get things done and in this story, he is assigned to the McGuire project. He reveals that flitterboats are used for transportation between Belts due to economic reasons and the limitations of vac suits.", "In the story \"His Master's Voice\" by Randall Garrett, the nature of the relationship between Ravenhurst and Daniel Oak is one of tension and conflict. Ravenhurst is portrayed as a smart but socially incompetent individual, who has a tendency to make others dislike him without even trying. Oak, on the other hand, is a character who is not easily intimidated by Ravenhurst's demeanor and is not afraid to stand up to him.\n\nThe story begins with Oak visiting Ravenhurst's office on the planetoid called Raven's Rest. Ravenhurst is preoccupied with pouring wine due to the low gravity on the planetoid, and he doesn't even bother to look up at Oak when he enters. This lack of attention and disregard for social niceties sets the tone for their relationship.\n\nRavenhurst starts the conversation by offering Oak some Madeira wine, to which Oak politely accepts. However, it is clear that there is tension between them as they exchange pleasantries. Ravenhurst accuses Oak of causing him trouble and claims that Oak has abrogated his contract. Oak maintains his composure and suggests that if Ravenhurst wants to take legal action, they can go to court. Ravenhurst then clarifies that he is not trying to get back the fee he paid Oak, but rather wants Oak to rectify the damage he has caused.\n\nThe conflict between them stems from the fact that Oak was the first person to address orders to the activated robot named McGuire. According to Ravenhurst, the robot was designed so that the first person who spoke to it would become its master. This creates a problem because defining the term \"human being\" unambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. Ravenhurst believes that Oak's actions have inadvertently sabotaged McGuire and wants Oak to fix the situation.\n\nThroughout the conversation, Oak remains calm and assertive, not allowing Ravenhurst to intimidate him. He questions Ravenhurst's motives and demands that he gets to the point. This dynamic between the two characters highlights the power struggle and the lack of trust between them.\n\nIn conclusion, the relationship between Ravenhurst and Daniel Oak in \"His Master's Voice\" is one of conflict and tension. Ravenhurst, despite his intelligence, is socially incompetent and struggles to build positive relationships. Oak, on the other hand, is not easily intimidated and stands up for himself in the face of Ravenhurst's accusations. Their relationship is characterized by mistrust and a power struggle.", "Based on the story provided, there is no mention of a flitterboat or its usage in \"His Master's Voice\" by Walter M. Miller, Jr.", "In the story \"The Hoofer\" by Walter M. Miller Jr., the seventh edition of McGuire, a spaceship, is different from its predecessors in that it has been modified to address the issues that caused the previous models to go insane. The robotocists attempted to build in Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, but they found that if conflicting and confusing data were fed into the robot's brain, it could behave in ways that resemble human mental illnesses. To avoid this, the seventh model of McGuire was modified to only take orders from one responsible person, in this case, Daniel Oak. By defining an individual rather than a group, the robotocists hoped to ensure that McGuire would not go insane. This modification is significant because it allows McGuire to function as a spaceship without the risk of unpredictable and dangerous behavior.", "The storyline of \"Death Star\" revolves around a character named Starrett Blade, also known as \"Death Star\" Blade, who finds himself in a dangerous situation.

The buildings and bodies were burned, indicating that the aliens possessed a heat ray. All technical equipment, radios, guns, machines, and even books were also missing.\n\nTo protect themselves from alien attacks, the colonists had security measures in place. Each colony had a detonator in one of the main buildings, with a bomb buried in the center of the village. The purpose of this bomb was to destroy the entire village in case of an enemy attack, to prevent the aliens from gaining knowledge about human technology and body chemistry. However, at Lupus V, the bomb had been detonated but had not exploded because the detonating wire had been cut. This discovery puzzled the army, who spread the news but did not take any further action due to their small size and lack of respect.\n\nAs a result of the attack on Lupus V and other colonies, humans began to fall back from their space exploration and return to Earth. Most of the colonists managed to evacuate in time, but a few died before the army ships could reach them.

Carmen's club keeps getting bodies dumped in its kitchen, and he needs a way to dispose of them without attracting attention from the police. Carmen believes that Venetti, who is working on a project to get rid of trash for the government, can help him find a solution.\n\nVenetti is initially reluctant to get involved in anything illegal, but Carmen convinces him by mentioning the Mafia's influence and the potential harm they can cause. Venetti agrees to help and suggests using his research on radioactive waste disposal to find a solution. However, their plans are interrupted when a government official informs them that the use of Venetti's Expendable devices, which destroy matter without creating energy, is causing the Earth's temperature to rise dangerously.\n\nThe government decides to confiscate all Expendable devices and ban their production and importation. Venetti reluctantly agrees with this decision, fearing that the public will hoard the devices and continue using them, leading to catastrophic consequences. However, Tony Carmen objects to the ban and proposes leaking the information about the Expendables to the public, marketing them as a convenient and versatile tool.\n\nVenetti is initially skeptical but eventually agrees to Carmen's plan. They decide to call the devices Expendables and promote them as a must-have household item. Venetti realizes that this may lead to an increase in the murder rate, as the devices can be used to dispose of bodies easily. However, Carmen argues that it is not their responsibility to control how people use the devices, comparing it to the invention of firearms or automobiles.\n\nIn the end, it is implied that the government may not be interested in Venetti's machine, but Carmen sees the potential and plans to capitalize on it. The story leaves the outcome of their plan uncertain, but it highlights the ethical dilemma faced by Venetti and the potential consequences of introducing a powerful and potentially dangerous technology into society.", "In the story \"The Expendables\" by Jim Harmon, the Expendables are a group of bodies that keep appearing at Tony Carmen's club. These bodies are not victims of murder, but rather accident victims that are being dumped at the club to cause trouble for Tony. He is seeking help from Professor Venetti, who works for the United States government. Tony asks Venetti to use his research on disposing of radioactive waste to help him get rid of these bodies without getting caught by the police. Venetti is initially reluctant, but feels compelled to help due to the threat of the Mafia. He agrees to try and find a solution to Tony's problem.", "The story \"The Expendables\" addresses the issue of global warming and convenience through the conversation between the protagonist and the AEC (Atomic Energy Commission) man. The AEC man explains that the widespread use of the Expendable devices, created by the protagonist, is responsible for the higher temperature on Earth. The devices seemingly destroy matter without creating energy, but in reality, they add the energy created in destroying matter to the energy potential of the planet in the form of heat. This poses a danger to the planet as the mean temperature could rise to the point where the world bursts into flames. Therefore, the government intends to confiscate all Expendable devices and ban their manufacture and importation.\n\nThe protagonist reluctantly agrees with the AEC man's reasoning, but Tony Carmen disagrees. He argues that if the public is made aware of the danger and feels the heat rise themselves, they will hoard Expendables and continue to use them until the planet reaches a point of extreme heat. This is because Expendables are convenient, similar to how people still water lawns and fill swimming pools despite bans on frivolous water use.\n\nThe young man from the AEC worries about the consequences of not being able to design engines in time to consume the excess energy. However, the protagonist assures him that by reversing the field of the Expendable device, a low-efficiency engine can be created to use up the excess energy in the planet's potential.\n\nIn summary, the story addresses the issue of global warming by showcasing how the convenient use of Expendable devices contributes to the rise in temperature on Earth. It also highlights the challenge of addressing this issue due to the convenience and reluctance of the public to give up such devices.", "In the story \"The Expendables,\" the theme of capitalism is explored through the character of Tony Carmen and his greed for profits over safety in selling Professor Venetti's machine. Tony Carmen, a businessman, approaches Professor Venetti with a proposition to use his invention for illegal activities, specifically disposing of bodies. Despite the professor's initial reluctance, Carmen uses his knowledge of the Mafia's presence to coerce him into helping.\n\nCarmen's focus on profits is evident in his plan to market the machine as the \"Expendables\" and generate widespread demand. He believes that by leaking information about the machine's capabilities, it can be positioned as a must-have item for every household. He disregards the potential dangers and ethical implications of such a device, only seeing the financial gains it can bring.\n\nThe professor, on the other hand, is more concerned with the potential misuse of his invention. He acknowledges that the government may not be interested in his machine, as they often receive things they don't know how to handle. He fears that in the wrong hands, the Expendables can be used for nefarious purposes, contributing to an increase in the murder rate.\n\nThe story highlights the clash between the professor's moral concerns and Carmen's capitalist mindset. While the professor sees the potential harm in selling the machine to the public, Carmen sees it as an opportunity for immense profit. The theme of capitalism is explored through Carmen's willingness to prioritize financial gain over the safety and ethical implications of the technology.", "The story \"Desire No More\" follows the protagonist, Judy, who as a child made a wish at a fountain and had her wishes come true.
