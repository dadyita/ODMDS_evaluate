Willard, the lone survivor of the Mary Lou, spent years in solitude and despair, longing for Earth and the memories of his life there.\n\nThe desolation of Earthmen is primarily caused by the isolation and loneliness of space travel. Willard describes the anguish of being alone in space, with only memories of Earth to keep him company. He dreams of his life on Earth, walking the streets of his hometown, hearing the voices of friends and loved ones. These memories become even more precious to him as he realizes the unique voices of cities, fields, and shops that he had never noticed before.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the desolation of Earthmen is the legend of the Ghost Ship.

So, the robotocists decided to define a responsible human being and build McGuire to only take orders from that person. Daniel Oak was chosen as that responsible person, and McGuire would only obey orders from him. This modification was significant because it prevented the robots from behaving in ways that could be dangerous or harmful.
