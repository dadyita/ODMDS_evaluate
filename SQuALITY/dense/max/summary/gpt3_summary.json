The previous six models attempted to build in the Three Laws of Robotics exactly as stated by Isaac Asimov, but they all went insane when presented with conflicting orders from different human beings. The difficulty lies in defining the term \"human being\" in such a way that a logical robot can comprehend it. To solve this problem, the robotocists at Viking Spacecraft decided to define an individual instead of a group. They chose a responsible person, Daniel Oak, and modified McGuire so that it would only take orders from him. This modification is significant because it prevents the robot from receiving conflicting orders and potentially going insane.
