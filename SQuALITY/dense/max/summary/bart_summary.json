Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone only varies 50 to 60 degrees with the libration of Mercury, so the temperature only varies up to 50-60 degrees. The Solar \ufffd\u2019scope could take that much change and they\u2019d get good clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet to wheel around. The Twilight Lab wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the Brightside, but it was chosen because it was the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could hold his observatory. The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something about Mercury as well as the Sun when they camped at the Lab to make final preparations. \n\nJack Stone, the third member of the party, who had arrived with supplies and equipment a few days earlier, almost bawled when Sanderson gave him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside was like.

She takes the book and goes back to the literature section to read it. \n\nWhen she leaves, she takes down Taine's History of English Literature, and he takes down the Taine tome once more.
