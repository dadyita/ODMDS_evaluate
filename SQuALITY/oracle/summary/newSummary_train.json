The scientists believe that their treatment can cure Macklin's headaches and provide proof of their discovery.\n\nHowever, Macklin is hesitant to participate in the experiment due to the potential risks involved. He is concerned about the impact on his health and his ongoing project to develop a faster-than-light drive for the Army. Despite his initial reluctance, Macklin agrees to be the test subject and receives the injection of the F-M Virus.\n\nAfter the injection, Macklin's intelligence significantly decreases, and he becomes classified as a moron. The Army, who was involved in Macklin's project, is furious with the scientists for their unauthorized experimentation. They threaten legal action and demand that Macklin's intelligence be restored.\n\nThe scientists, Mitchell and Ferris, realize their mistake in miscalculating the virus's effects and offer to cure Macklin.

She believes that Macklin is happier without the burden of his previous intelligence and the accompanying headaches.\n\nThe Army tries to intervene, but Macklin's wife refuses to allow them to restore his intelligence. She argues that the risks involved in the treatment, such as the potential for a vascular spasm, outweigh the benefits of restoring his intelligence.\n\nIn the end, Macklin's wife's wishes prevail, and Macklin remains in his current state of reduced intelligence. The story raises questions about personal autonomy, the value of intelligence, and the trade-offs between intelligence and happiness.",

Despite his impressive reputation, Macklin suffers from severe migraines and has a history of vascular spasm and a mild pseudostroke. His migraines have caused him to miss classes and have been a concern for the Army project he is working on.\n\nDr. Ferris and Dr. Mitchell, two scientists, approach Macklin to ask for his help in testing their discovery of a virus that can cure headaches by feeding on pituitrin, the substance that causes the constriction of blood vessels in the brain. They explain that their research has shown that this constriction is the main cause of headaches. They have successfully tested the virus on animals but have not yet tried it on humans.\n\nMacklin initially declines their offer, citing the risk involved and his responsibilities to others. However, after experiencing another migraine attack, he agrees to undergo the treatment. The scientists inject him with the virus and monitor his progress. To their surprise, Macklin's intelligence decreases significantly, and he is diagnosed as a moron by standard intelligence tests. The virus has overcontrolled the supply of posterior pituitary extract in his brain, preventing proper blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain cells.\n\nColonel Carson, an Army officer involved in the project, is furious with the scientists for what has happened to Macklin. They explain that they can cure him by stabilizing the virus colonies and using an antitoxin, but Macklin's wife, who has always dominated his personal life, refuses to allow the treatment. She believes that Macklin is happier in his current state, free from the constant worry and pressure that his intelligence brought.\n\nCarson threatens legal action to have Macklin declared incompetent so that they can force the treatment upon him, but Mrs. Macklin argues that the risk involved in the treatment, including the potential for a stroke, makes it too dangerous. She asserts that she would rather have a live husband than a dead genius. The colonel reluctantly agrees with her decision.\n\nDr. Mitchell, however, contacts Macklin privately and tries to convince him to come to the laboratory for further treatment. Macklin is unsure, fearing that Mitchell might try to put him back in his previous state. Mitchell reassures him that he would never go against Macklin's wishes and suggests that Macklin bring Colonel Carson along. The story ends with Macklin agreeing to consider it.\n\nIn summary, Elliot Macklin is a mathematician and scientist with a reputation for his work on the Theory of Spatium. He suffers from severe migraines and agrees to undergo a treatment using a virus discovered by Dr. Ferris and Dr. Mitchell. However, the treatment has the unintended consequence of significantly decreasing Macklin's intelligence.

They approach Elliot Macklin, a renowned mathematician who suffers from severe migraines, to participate in the experiment.\n\nInitially hesitant, Macklin agrees to be the test subject.

They demand that Macklin be restored to his former state of intelligence. However, Macklin's wife, who has always felt overshadowed by his genius, refuses to allow the treatment, as it would bring back his debilitating migraines.\n\nThe scientists are unable to force Macklin to undergo the treatment, as he is legally responsible for his decisions. They realize that Macklin's wife prefers him in his current state, as it allows her to dominate him completely. They also acknowledge that restoring his intelligence would come with the risk of his migraines returning.\n\nIn the end, the scientists are unable to find a solution.

Despite their best efforts to persuade him, Macklin initially declines their offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitchell and Ferris are desperate for funding to continue their research. They decide to go public with their discovery in order to attract attention and financial support. They give an interview to the press, which leads to Macklin's wife, Mrs. Macklin, finding out about the potential cure for her husband's headaches.\n\nMrs. Macklin is initially skeptical, but she eventually agrees to let Mitchell and Ferris try to cure her husband. However, the experiment does not go as planned. Macklin's intelligence is significantly reduced, and he becomes what is considered a \"moron\" in terms of clinical intelligence quotient. This outcome shocks everyone involved, including the Army, which had a vested interest in Macklin's intelligence for their project.\n\nMitchell and Ferris realize that they made a miscalculation, and the virus colony over-controls the supply of posterior pituitary extract in the cerebrum, causing the brain cells to remain sluggish. They offer to try to reverse the effects and restore Macklin's intelligence, but Mrs. Macklin refuses. She believes that her husband is happier in his current state, free from the constant worry and pain of his headaches.\n\nColonel Carson, an Army officer involved in the project, initially opposes Mrs. Macklin's decision but eventually accepts it.
