    "In the story \"Venus Is a Man's World,\" the societal structures on Earth differ from Venus in several ways. On Earth, there is a shortage of men, with only three out of every four women being able to find husbands.

Overall, Evelyn's tricks and abilities allow her to survive and stay free in a dangerous and hostile environment.",
    "The significance of the device given to Evelyn not exploding is not explicitly mentioned in the story. However, based on the context of the story, it can be inferred that the device was intended to be used for a destructive purpose. Evelyn was given the device by her father, Lord Kane, with the understanding that if the mentors were successful in developing a force that would destroy both globes, she would have the task of pressing the final button of the battle. \n\nSince the device did not explode, it suggests that the mentors were not successful in developing the force to destroy both globes. This could mean that Evelyn's countrymen had not yet definitively won or lost the battle. It also implies that Evelyn's task of pressing the final button was not necessary at that time.\n\nThe significance of the device not exploding could also be seen as a turning point in the story. It presents a dilemma for Evelyn as she now has to find alternative ways to accomplish her mission of destroying the enemy globe. This adds tension and complexity to the plot, as Evelyn must navigate the challenges of finding the rare tools and parts to construct another key while also avoiding detection by the enemy.\n\nOverall, the significance of the device not exploding highlights the uncertainty and obstacles that Evelyn faces in her mission and adds depth to the story's conflict.",

Her father had instructed her to press the final button of the battle in the event of their defeat. \n\nEvelyn finds herself in a stalemate. She is unable to carry out her duty because the mahogany box containing the key has been destroyed in the explosion that crushed her cell. She realizes that constructing another key would take months, and by then, the invaders would have detached from the dead battle globe. \n\nShe decides to use her six weeks to find a way to accomplish the stalemate in space. She must determine if the prime movers are intact and if she can safely enter the pile room to set them in motion and draw the moderator columns. If it is unsafe, she plans to secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian enemies. \n\nThroughout the story, Evelyn is driven by her sense of duty. She is willing to sacrifice her own life and endure physical pain to fulfill her duty to her countrymen and her father. She is determined to find a way to carry out her duty, even in the face of overwhelming odds. \n\nThe theme of duty is also explored through the character of Perat, the Occupational Commandant. He has a duty to oversee the occupation and maintain control over the conquered territory. He takes pleasure in his duty to kill prisoners and demonstrates a cruel and sadistic nature. However, when he discovers Evelyn's resemblance to a woman from his past, he becomes intrigued and questions his own duty and the purpose of the war. \n\nIn conclusion, the theme of duty is explored in this story through the actions and decisions of the characters.
