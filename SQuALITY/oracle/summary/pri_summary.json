    "The story begins with Noork, an exile from the walled city of Grath, on a small moon called Sekk, searching for a way to escape from the evil beings who stole away his friends. He encounters a young woman, Tako, who is hunting a spotted narl. She tells him that her name is Tako and that she is a hunter or escaped slave. He introduces himself as Noork and tells her that he has been on the moon for many days with his friend, Gurn, who also lives on Sekk. He tells her about how he killed a narl last night when it attacked him, and that he is glad that Gurn is his brother. He then tells her the story of how five of them escaped from the city of Konto and headed toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians lay. Noork kills one of the guards with an arrow, and then kills the other one with a knife and a club. He returns to the forest, where he meets the girl, and she tells him about how she is angry with him for what he has done to her because he is a traitor to the people of Zuran. He explains to her that the men of the island prey upon their own kind, and the Temple is guarded by cowardly warriors. He goes on to tell her about his time in the jungle with Gurn and how they killed a great-looking man named Tholon Sarna, who was captured by the guards and taken to a hidden village. He also tells her a story about the time when he was a renegade, and how he saved five of his friends from the Konto people, and now he is on a mission to save them from the same people. He kills the guards, and when he gets close to the Temple, he is attacked by the Misty Ones, who claim to be the ones who killed Tholon, and he kills all of them except for one. The story ends with him and the girl in a clearing, where they find the body of Tholon.",
    "The story takes place on the second moon of the planet Luna. It is small, less than five hundred miles in diameter, and its meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk, life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an ovallake gleams softly in the depths. The story begins with a white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatting in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watching the trail forty feet below. He sees a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and asheathed dagger. Sight of the girl\u2019s flowing brown hair and the graceful femininecontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter makes his brow wrinkle with concentration. He looks toward the east where lay themysterious long lake of the Misty Ones. He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath, and the city rulers call him a traitor. He has told him the reason. Sarna, his brother, said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from other valleys. Noork smiles. Tako, woman, he greets her. She is displeased with the noises of your tongue. I willlisten to it no more. He climbs further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe fruit hangs heavy. With a grin he locks his legs upon the forking of the great limb and fills his arms with fruit. A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketes the misty shapes. Patchy outlines take on a new color and sharpness. His keen ears, now that he is no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. Heturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, he swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Oncethere, perched in the crotch of the mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the seemingly empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. He then sees the white savage, Noork, squatted in the enormous crotch of an enormous jungle giant, and watched the trail that leads to the Temple of the Skull. The girl is alertly observing the trail, and her only weapon is a yellow wood bow and an as-heated dagger. He speaks in the language of the true men, and speaks to her in the voice of Gurn, the renegade leader of the Vasad people. He tells her that he killed the spotted narl last night when it attacked her, and she puts away her bow. He also tells her the story of how he escaped from the city of Zuran and now lives on the small moon of Sekk. He shows her the scars on his face, and he tells her about how he killed a narl when he was a boy, and how he is glad he is now a free man. He introduces himself as Noork and tells her his name is Tholon Sarna. She asks him to take her to his brother's hidden village, and from there they will explore Grath. He says he is going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away his friends. He smiles. She does not answer his words, but he says that he will visit her brother's village after he has taken her to the place where the unknown evil beings stole away her friends. Then he smiles and says he will take her back to New York.",
    "Gurn is the leader of the mysterious creatures known as the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull. He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath. He has lived on the second moon of Zuran for many days with his friend Gurn, who is also a traitor to the city. Gurn and Noork have been friends for a long time, and Gurn has taught Noork the language of the misty-skinned, brown-skinned creatures called the \"Misty Ones\". Gurn is tall and strong, and his forehead is low and retreating in a bestial fashion. He wears a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons are two long knives and a club. Noork, on the other hand, wears a short, broad-bladed sword that swings in its sheath at his belt and lets it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper of flexible leather on steel. He looks toward the east where lay themysterious long lake of Misty Ones, and he says that one day, he is going to visit the island of the unseen evil beings who stole away his friends. Perhaps after he has taken you to your brother's hidden village. Tako, woman, he greets her. His keen ears, now that he is no longer speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. Heturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctivereflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm, he felt nothing for some time. One armed as he was temporarily, he swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Oncethere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down at the seemingly empty stretch of sunken trail beneath. In one of those green valleys, the white savage that the Vasads called Noork squatted in the vastness of a jungle giant and watched the trail forty feet below. He sees a golden skinned girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and asheathed dagger. Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful femininecontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the insignificance of her breech-clout made his brow wrinkle with concentration. Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest, he had confirmed that belief. For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death of a mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeats them aloud. Hestrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him, and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more. A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath them. His lip curled at what he saw. The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden asthat of the other men of Zurans, and there was more hair on his forehead. His face was hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregulardesign. His garb is Vasad, yet he speaks in the language spoken by the true men. He speaks in a language similar to that of the real Zurans. His clothes are made of green and light green. He also wears a tunic and two knives. He tells Noork that the men of the island prey upon their own kind, and that the temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors likethis Noork shrugs his shoulders and sets off at a mile-devouring pace down the game trail toward the lake. Once he stops at a leaf-choked pool to wash the stains from the dead man's foggy robe. The jungle was thinning out.",
    "The enslavement of the second moon is significant in the story because it marks the beginning of the end of Noork\u2019s existence on the planet of Sekk. He is the first person to have been taken from his home planet of Zuran and brought to the second planet of Luna, and he is the only one to survive. This is because he was the first one to see the Misty Ones, the creatures that live on the other side of the lake, and the first to kill one of them. Noork kills one of the creatures with his bow, and it is then that he realizes that he is actually an exile from the walled city of Grath, and that the creatures are not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons, but are living breathing creatures like himself. He also realizes that they are not the same creatures as the other creatures, but rather, they are the living breathing descendants of the original settlers of the planet. He realizes this when he kills the first creature, and then when he sees the second one, and realizes that these creatures are his friends. This realization makes him realize that he has been taken and enslaved by the same people who took his friends from him on the first planet.",
    "The Misty Ones are a group of creatures that live on the second moon of the planet Luna. They are described as living breathing creatures that are similar to the humans of Zuran, except they are not gods, or demons, or even the spirits of demons. They speak the language of the true men of the jungle, and Noork is fascinated by them. He is also an exile from the walled city of Grath, and the city rulers consider him a traitor because he is the reason that they captured Zurans from other valleys. Noork kills one of the creatures with his bow, and when he goes to kill the other one, he is attacked by the Misty Ones. He kills them, and they are captured by the men of Konto, who are guarding the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its unseen guardians are. The Misty Ones have been the main focus of the story because they are the ones that save Noork and his friends from the Konto men. They save the life of Noork\u2019s friend, Tholon Sarna, and save the lives of the other five men who were captured by Konto. They also save his life when he shoots one of them with his own bow.",
    "Dobbin, Willard\u2019s best friend and space mate, is dying. Willard, the son of the lost explorer, is planning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called Mary Lou II, in memory of his father. The ship has not been seen or heard from since. The story begins with Willard sitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars. A star flickered and then dimmed, and Willard sees a faint shape that reminds him of an old-fashioned rocket ship that did pioneer service in the lanes forty years ago. The shape is round in shape and almost invisible, and there is something about its form that reminded him of a rocket ship. He traces its semi-circular course towards his ship and sees that it is not from the solar system, and is headed toward it. He calculates that it will reach his ship in four years, and his heart begins to beat in ever quickening excitement. He knows that he will never see Earth again, but he also knows what he dared not admit to himself: that he, too, will not see Earth ever again. After two days Willard keeps vigil over the body of his friend, and the time is up, he does what is necessary, and nothing remains of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had ever had. The atoms of his body are now pure energy stored away in the motors of the Mary Lou. He thinks about the Ghost Ship, the ship that Dobbin had seen before he died, and wonders if there is a scientific reason for it. The Ghost Ship turns back, but Willard reminds himself that he cannot see it because it is too far away, and it is impossible for him to be there. He looks again at the strange ship, but it is motionless, and he cannot discern its faint motion. He wonders if it is a mass of fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that does not disperse, or even a moving warp of space-light. After a few minutes, he realizes that the ship is turning back, so he reaches out with his hand to hold it back, for when it is gone, he will be alone again. But the ghost ship goes on, and its outline becomes smaller and smaller and fainter. He turns away from the window as the ship disappears into the emptiness of space. Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard would never see there was published a small item: Arden, Rocketport - Thirteen years ago the Space Ship Mary Lou under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the exploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The expedition was supposed to return to Earth, but they never did return. J.J. willard, II, son of J.I., is planning to manufacture the next generation of the space ship, named after his father, in honor of his memory. The space ship is to be named after him.",
    "Memory plays a significant role in the story. Willard\u2019s memories of his time aboard the Space Ship Mary Lou are significant because they are the only thing he has left of his friend and space mate, Harry Dobbin. He has tried to rip the memories from his mind in order to live a normal life on Earth, but they remain with him. He is the only one who has ever known Dobbin, and he tries to protect his memories from being destroyed by the events of two years in space. The memory of the space ship is significant because it is the one thing that Willard has left with him, and it is his only source of comfort and hope for the future. He also thinks about the Ghost Ship, which he has heard about before, but he has never put any stock in it. He thinks of it as a scientific reason for it, as it must be true, as there is no other ship like it on Earth. The Ghost Ship is also significant because Willard is the sole survivor of the lost explorer, as he is planning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called Mary Lou II, in memory of his father. The ship has not been seen or heard from since.",
    "Larry Dobbin is Willard\u2019s best friend in space. He is the only person that Willard has ever known. He has been with Willard for four years, having traveled with him on the Space Ship Mary Lou under the leadership of John Willard and Larry Dobbin. When Dobbin dies, Willard tries to comfort him, but it is clear that he is no longer the same person he was before. He looks back fondly upon the memories of his time in space, and Willard realizes that he has tried to rip the memories out of his mind, but they are still very dear to him. When Willard is planning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called Mary Lou II in memory of his father, he thinks of Larry as the only thing that is dear to his heart. When the time is up he does what is necessary, and nothing remains of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he has ever had. The atoms of his body are now pure energy stored away in the useless motors of the Mary Lou. The ship has not been seen or heard from since. Willard keeps vigil over the body of his friend and space mate for two days, and when it is time for him to go, he does his best to hold on to the memories. After a few minutes, he realizes that the ship is turning back, and the Ghost Ship is coming towards him. Unconsciously Willard reaches out with his hand to hold it back, because he knows that when it disappears, he will be alone again. The Ghost Ship goes on a semi-circular course, and he calculates that it is not from the solar system, and it is headed toward his ship. When it reaches the ship, he looks out the port window and sees a faint mass that reminds him of an old-fashioned rocket ship that did pioneer service in the lanes forty years ago. He traces its shape and sees that it resembles one of those that had done pioneer service fortyyears ago. The shape of the ship reminds Willard of the ghost ship that Dobbin had seen before he died, but Willard does not believe it is real because he has never seen it in person. After the ship reaches Willard, he sees that the shape is similar to that of a rocket ship, and his heart begins to beat again. He tries to hold onto the memories, but the words are lost. He turns away from the window and watches as the ship disappears into the emptiness of space.",
    "Ghost Ships are mentioned in the story as the reason for Willard and Dobbin\u2019s departure from the ship. They are described as a phenomenon that happens whenever a space man dies in space. Willard is the only person who has ever seen one, and he believes that the Ghost Ship will come for him when he dies. He believes that it is due to the fact that he has been away from Earth for four years, and the ship is on a semi-circular course towards Earth. The ship has not been seen or heard from since, and Willard wants to find out what happened to his friend. The Ghost Ship is also significant because it is the reason why Willard decides to manufacture a super-size exploration ship to be called Mary Lou II, in memory of his father. When Willard first sees the ship, it is in the shape of an old-fashioned rocket ship, and it reminds him of the ones that did pioneer service in the lanes forty years ago. He thinks of his friend as a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any man could. He also thinks of the feeling of walking on solid ground for the first time in four years. When the ship reaches Earth, Willard realizes that he will never see Earth again, and this makes him sad. The story ends with Willard, the only man who has seen the ghost ship, dying.",
    "Dobbin is Willard\u2019s only friend in space, and Willard considers him to be the best friend he has ever had. Willard cares deeply about Dobbin, and he tries to protect him as much as he can, even sacrificing his own life to save Dobbin. When Dobbin dies, Willard tries to comfort him, but it is clear that Dobbin is no longer the same person he was before. He is now an old man who has lived four years in space and has no friends, no family, and no friends. When Willard is planning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called Mary Lou II in memory of his father, he thinks of his friend as the only thing that matters to him. He tries to rip the memories of his childhood from his mind, but they stay with him. When the time is up, he does what is necessary to save his friend, and the ship is built. The atoms of his body are now pure energy stored away in the useless motors of the Mary Lou. The weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind, the chance meteor that damaged the convertors and assimilators spared the ship. Through constant care and attention, the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept. The substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious food and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed. When this was done, Willad immediately regretted it. For it would bethen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes he thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless controlboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours inthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A greatloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever known would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair and hopeless pain. Two years after Dobbin's death, a strange thing happened: Willard was sitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars when a star flickered, and it dimmed and turned bright again. He watched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion, and then a third and a fourth, and a fifth, and his heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few minutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes would help while away the maddening long hours. He traced its course by the flickering stars and plotted its semi-circular course. He was not from the solar system but headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused his heart to beat in ever quickening excitement, and when he looked out the port window, a faint mass was nearing his ship. The shape of the ship reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty-five years ago. He looked again at the strange ship, motionless, and its vague outline. He knew how his space mate felt: no man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to beanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but noman can live without Earth. He also knew what Willard dared not admit to himself: he, too, would never see Earth again; Willard also knew that he and his crew members would find their battered hulk of a ship inspace and bring them home again. Dobbin motioned to Willard and, in answer to his last request, lifted him so that Willard could see the ship, but the ship was no longer moving. When he sees the faint mass nearing, he looks out the window and sees a faint shape that reminds him of a rocket ship. It is round in shape and almost invisible. The stars are dimmed, but faint, and there is something about its form that resembles an old fashioned rocket ship, similar to those that did pioneer service forty years ago or more.",
    "The story begins with Retief, the Councillor of the Terrestrial Embassy on the planet of Fust, discussing with Ambassador Magnan, a Fustian, a matter of sponsorship of Youth groups with some youths. The Fustians are a long-lived people with an average age of seventy-five. The Ambassador tells Retief that the Youth Movement is the most important news in today\u2019s political situation on Fust. Magnan tells him that sponsoring Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the Terran Embassy. Retief goes to the shipyard to look over some plans for a passenger liner, and the Ambassador reminds him that it is not a secret project. A heavy-faced youth, wrapped in a mantle, comes to take a look at the plans for the new liner, but Retief refuses. The youth leaves, and Retief visits the shipyards to see if he can learn more about the new passenger liner they are putting together. He meets with the shipbuilder, where he learns that the ship is to be built by the Fusians, and that they are looking for a sponsor. The ship is being built by a group called the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, and they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment, and anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural, and athletic development. The ambassador warns Retief not to talk to the youth about the secret project, and tells him to take it up with the Groaci Embassy, who are more interested in the future of the planet than the Terrestrials. When Retief returns to the Embassy, he meets with Magnan again, and this time, the ambassador tells him about the discovery of a new group called SCARS, and how they are seeking a sponsor for their new ship. The Groaci are the leaders of the future, and have a passionate interest in atwo-horse world like Fust; they are concerned with nothing but business. The diplomat reminds Retief of the fact that they have a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy, and Fust is barely ahead of them in the market for such devices on a world where they can move fast when they choose. The diplomatic relations between the two groups are tense, and Magnan reminds Retrief that he is not the diplomat of his experience doing anything so naive because he has only been in Fust for a month, and it has been his experience that few races are above improving on nature. He also tells him not to bring up the idea of surgery for the Fuses\u2019 unfortunate physical characteristics, as it is hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity. The next day, Retief leaves the Embassy and heads to the Shipyards to look at some drawings of the ship they are building, and is interrupted by a voice telling him to leave. The voice is from the ship's youth organization, SCARS; they want Retief to help them with their plans to build a new ship, and he agrees. The two go to a shed, where a gnarled old man with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace peeks out at Retief. The old man tells the diplomat that he should take up a proposal for a pest control group, and retorts that Retief is not convinced these hoodlums need his help in organizing their rumble, and says that they will go broke instead of him. The young man goes on to tell Retief about the group, which is called the SCARS. The gray-haired Fusian says that he can\u2019t actually order him to step forward because the group requires a sponsor, so Retief tries to find out more about them, but the old man shuts him down. The story ends with the two in a bar.",
    "The Fustians are a long-lived people with an average age of seventy-five. The average Fustian male is at a trying age, which means that they will try anything in the hope that it will maim somebody. They are interested in business. They have a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy, and the Groaci are barely ahead of them. They look like turtles, but they can move fast when they chose. They like to lughalf a ton of horn around on their backs, and they wonder if surgery would help. They also like to improve on nature. The Groaci have an interest in improving on nature as well, but their interest is limited to business. The Terrestrial Embassy has a program for the day that includes going over to the shipyards to look over some of the plans for a new passenger liner that they are putting together. Retief, the Councillor, is there to look into some features of the new liner. The Ambassador, Magnan, tells Retief that there is nothing to conceal, and that the ship is not a secret project, so Retief goes to take a look at the drawings. A heavy-faced youth, wrapped in a mantle, stands at the door of Retief\u2019s office, and a gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace peeks out at Retief. Long-may-you-sleep, Retief says. He\u2019d like to look around, if you don\u2019t mind. The Youth Movement is the most important news in the political situation here on Fust, and sponsorsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the Terran Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of themission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p\u2014that is, cement relationships with this emergent power group\u2014the leaders of the future. Magnan says that Retief is not convinced these hoodlums need his help in organizing their rumbles, and Retief points out that he is the outstanding exception. The youth group, known as the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been waiting for a sponsor for a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment, and anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural, and athletic development. The ambassador says that he cannot order Retief to step forward because the group requires a sponsor, but Retief has a better idea. The diplomat goes to the shed and knocks on the door, and Magnan lets him in. The old man tells him that he knows the way of the naked-back, who move always in haste, and retorts that he should take up professional racing. The two go into the shipyard, where Retief takes a seat on a flat-car to look at some plans for the ship. The ship is to be a passenger liner, but the Ambassador says that it is not meant to be secret, so he cannot tell Retief what features are on the ship, and then Retief leaves. The next day, the Ambassador gives Retief a copy of the drawings, and he copies them for his own use. The young man, Slock, is one of the leaders of a group called the S.C.S.A.R.I.S., and he wants Retief involved in his organization, SCARS. The group is planning to build a new ship for the future of the planet, and it is led by a young man named Slock. He is the leader of the group, who is interested in improving the planet's environment. He has a reputation for being violent and violent, but he does not like the Terrestrials. He wants to help Retief study the social patterns of the local youth. He also wants to get himself a good blackjack.",
    "Magnan is the Ambassador of the Terrestrial Embassy on the planet Fust. He is a Fustian who has been in the position for a little over a month, and he is very interested in the future of the Fustians. He has been hired by the Terran Embassy to help with the development of their new passenger liner, which is currently under construction. Magnan is a very important figure in the story because he is the one who first introduces Retief to the shipyard where the ship is being built. He also serves as the initiator of Retief\u2019s meeting with the Groaci Embassy, where he explains to Retief the importance of the Youth Movement and its importance to the future leaders of the future. When Retief arrives at the shipyards, he meets with Magnan, who tells him that the ship they are building is not a secret project, and that there is nothing to conceal. The Ambassador also tells Retief that there are three strong political parties on Fust, and the youth groups are all part of the SCARS organization. The Youth Movement is the most important news in the current political situation, and Magnan tries to convince Retief not to get too involved with these groups. However, Retief is interested in learning more about them, so he decides to take a look at the drawings of the new liner. He takes out a tiny camera and takes a photo of the drawings, clicking the shutter. When he shows it to the Ambassador, the Ambassador agrees to let Retief study them in peace. When the Ambassador leaves, he gives Retief a coin to take with him.",
    "Whonk is the leader of the Fustian Youth Movement, a group that is seeking sponsorship of a new passenger liner. He is described as a young man of about twenty-five years old, average age seventy-five. He looks like a turtle-like creature with long, bulbous limbs. He speaks in the language of Fustians, and is described to be a bit of a daredevil. When Retief meets him at the shipyard, he tells him that the Youth Movement is a shrewd stroke on the part of the Terrestrial Embassy. He also tells him about the importance of sponsorship of Youth groups on Fust. Whonk also tells Retief that the Groaci are interested in Fust because they have found leaders who are passionate about business and want to use Fust for their own purposes. He asks Retief to look over the drawings of the new liner that the youth are putting together, but Retief refuses. He then goes to see the ship, where he meets the ship\u2019s captain, Mr. Tony, and learns that the ship is to be built by the Groacians, a race with a strong interest in the future. After the meeting, Retief goes to the ship to learn more about the ship and its features, but he is interrupted by a call from the Ambassador, Magnan, who tells him to leave. After Retief leaves, he meets with the ship's captain, Tony, at the dining area. Tony informs him that he is to meet with the governor of Groacia, Slock, to discuss the future of the planet, and that they are planning to overthrow the Terrestrials. Retief learns from Tony that the governor is a scheming, scheming old man who wants to take over Fust, and he warns Retief not to get too close to him because he is a danger to the planet. After Tony and the governor meet with Retief, they tell him that they will no longer be able to work with him because they are no longer able to afford to pay his debts. Tony explains to Retief the reasons for the change in leadership, and Retief realizes that the current government is controlled by a group called the SCARS organization. The organization is made up of the elders of the future, and it is led by a man named Skaw. Skaw is a scrawny, young man with long gray hair and blue eyes. He tries to convince Retief of the benefits of cooperation with the future Groaci, who are planning on overthrowing the Terran Embassy, but the Ambassador reminds him that there is no such thing as cooperation. After Skaw and the other leaders are defeated, Skaw sends Retief on his way, and the story ends.",
    "The story takes place on the planet of Fust. The Terrestrial Embassy is located in a sprawling bungalow-type building that houses the chancery of the Terrestrial Ambassador. There is a passing flat-car that takes Retief through the city towards the looming gantries of the shipyards. It is a cool morning with a light breeze that carries the fishy smell of fustydwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians walk briskly along in the shade of low buildings. The driver of the flat car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his back, swings the unwieldy conveyance through the shipyard gates. A young man, wrapped in a mantle, stands at the door of a rambling shed. A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace peeks out at Retief. Long-may-you sleep, said Retief, I'd like to take a look around, ifyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your newliner today. May-you-dream-of-the-deeps, the old fellow mumbled. He waves a stumpyarm toward a group of shell-less Fustans standing by a massive hoist. If we don't act promptly, Magnan said, the Groaci Embassy may well anticipate us. Retief climbs down, handed him a coin. He crosses the littered yard and taps at one of the sheds. Then the door swings back. Magnan lets the sentence hang in the air, and Retief raises one eyebrow. For a minute there, he thinks Retief was going to make a positive statement. Then Magnan says that Retief is not convinced these hoodlums need his help in organizing their rumble. He says that he is not a diplomat of his experience doing anything so naive, but Retief points out that he has only been in Fust for a month, and that few races are above improving on nature. The story then moves to the offices of the Terran Embassy, where Retief meets with Ambassador Magnan. The offices are in a large, colonial-style building. The Ambassador shows Retief a piece of paper with the third memoire on the subject of sponsorship of Youth groups. It refers to some youths, average age seventy-five. The ambassador explains that the Youth Movement is the most important news in today\u2019s political situation on Fust, and sponsoring Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the Terrarestrial Embassy. At his suggestion, Retief offers to look over the plans for the new passenger liner the Fusians are putting together, and Magnan agrees. The next day, the Ambassador sends Retief to a shipyard for a look at the drawings of the new liner. The ship is to be a passenger liner, and the Ambassador tells Retief that it is a secret project, and it cannot be kept secret. When Retief goes to the ship, he meets with a Fusian youth, who tells him that they need a sponsor for the ship. The youth tells him about the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, and they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment, and anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural, and athletic development. The Youth Movement requires a sponsor, so Retief visits the ship to see if he can find one. He meets with the youth and learns that they are very active here, but they will go broke if they don\u2019t have a sponsor. He goes to a room in the ship for a drink. When he returns to the office, he finds Magnan, who is in charge of the diplomatic relations between Fust and the Terrestrials, and tells him to take care of his diplomatic duties.",
    "The story begins with Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignoring the jangling telephones and the excited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. He thinks about the mysterious germ attack that is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack, and a noncom is sitting on top of the whole powder keg. Andy\u2019s big hands clenched into fists, and he has to wait a moment before he can speak safely. May I remind you, general, that I\u2019ve been entombed here for two years. My staff and I know what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority, we\u2019ll try to figure this thing out. But good heavens, a chicken colonel moaned, this is all soirregular. A noncom! He said it like a dirty word. Irregular, hell, the brigadier snorted, the message getting through. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the sergeant get to work. Andy doesn\u2019t waste time standing, he merely nods to the general, snubs out his cigarette, and buzzes the intercom. Bettijean comes back into the office with another stack of papers. She gives him a motherly smile as she puts down a thick sheaf of papers, she tries to save him some time. He runs fingers through his thick, brown hair and massages his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to his wary and confused brain. What's new? I've gone though some of these, she says. Tried to save you alittle time. Sit down. She pulls up a chair and thumbs through the papers. So far, no deaths have been reported. Wichita, Wichita O.K., Indianapolis, Indy, Tulsa, Tulsa Ok, Buffalo, and abunch more. Except one little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign for everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today they were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up. They all got it. Andy shrugged. He rummages through the clutter on his desk and comes up with a crude chart. The isolated mountain areas of the West and South, but reports are too fragmentary. People deathly ill, but nobody dying. People stricken in every part of the country. How does it spread? In food? How can they all goof at the sametime? On the wind? But who could accurately predict every wind over the entirecountry\u2014even Alaska and Hawaii\u2014without hitting Canada or Mexico? And why wouldn't everybody get it in a given area? The colonel tries to relax his square face, but tension rides every weathered wrinkle and fear glints behind the pale gray eyes. Andy, do you think it's an enemy? I don't know, he says. For a long moment he sits there, unable to draw strength from her, punishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his brain, he reaches back into his chair and reaches for a clue\u2014a trend\u2014an inkling of something. Henodded toward the outer office. Stop all in-coming calls. Get those girls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country; have them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up another relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and sandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and occupation of the victims. You and I will start with Washington. He calls until every finger of his right hand is sore. He speaks toworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical nurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible crawl as writer's cramps knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned down to a raspy whisper. But columns pointed vaguely to trends.",
    "Andy McCloud is the Sergeant Major of the Office of Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection in the Pentagon. He has been in charge of this office for two years. He is a tall, handsome man with freckles and an unruly mop of hair, and he has a boyish look. When he first meets Bettijean, she is a slim, black-headed corporal who comes into his office with a stack of papers. She explains to him that she has gone through some of the reports and tries to save him some time. She also tells him that there is no panic yet, which is why there\u2019s no panic, but it seems like the water is spreading like a plague. The colonel tries to relax his square face, but tension rides every weathered wrinkle and fear glints behind the pale gray eyes. He also tells Andy that he is afraid of the unknown, but the colonel assures him that everything will be fine. When the colonel leaves, Andy goes to his office to get more information about the situation. He receives a call from the colonel, who tells him to stop all in-coming calls to hospitals in every city and town in the country, have them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up another relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and sandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and occupation of the victims. He then goes to Washington, where he meets with the new lieutenant, Maybeth. He tells her that Colonel Patterson was retired ten days ago, so he doesn\u2019t know what happened, but he has no idea why his replacement has not showed up. He calls the colonel again, and this time, the colonel admits that he does not know why the colonel is not showing up, and that he thinks it could be sabotage. Andy tells the colonel that he has to come through, and the colonel promises him that he will. Later, when the colonel comes back into the office, he tells Andy to report to him, and they go to the dining room to eat. When they get there, they see a crowd of people, and McCloud tells them that they should all vote against the new water system because it is unfit for the American people. McCloud also tells the Colonel that he cannot drink the water because he is sick from the plague. He goes back to his desk, where the colonel gives him a cigarette, and then he goes to bed. The next morning, McCloud wakes up in his office, and when he looks at the newspapers, he sees that the plague has spread to every part of the country. He decides to call the colonel and tell him that they have to find a way to stop this from happening to the people of the United States. He asks the colonel if he has any idea of an enemy, to which the colonel replies that he doesn't know, and Andy says that he just wants to know how to get to the bottom of it. The two then go out for coffee, where McCloud explains to the colonel what he knows about the plague to him. They then go to a restaurant, where they have a tense conversation about how to stop it from spreading to the rest of the world. The Colonel tells McCloud that he knows how to fight it, but McCloud does not want to fight the plague, so they go back to their office.",
    "Bettijean and Andy have a very good working relationship. She treats him as a motherly figure, and he looks up to her a lot. They work well together, and it shows in the way they interact with each other. When the colonel comes into the office, Bettijean tries to calm Andy down, and she also tries to comfort him when he is upset about the situation. When he is angry, she tries to cheer him up, and when she sees that he is scared, she encourages him to calm down. They also work well as a team, and they work together to solve the mystery of the plague. When Andy is angry at the colonel, he tells her that he does not want to report to her, but she reminds him that there is a war going on. He also tells the colonel that he can drink water, but he cannot vote for the new water system. This makes the colonel very angry, and the two work together well.",
    "Janis is the secretary of the Office of the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator at the Pentagon. She is the first person that Andy meets during the story who tells him about the symptoms of the plague. When he first meets her, she tells him that she has been working on this case for two days, and that there is nothing she can do to help him because she is the only one who has been there for two years. She also informs him that there has been no new lieutenant in the office for ten days, which makes him think that the colonel is the enemy. When Andy asks her if she thinks it is an enemy, she says that she doesn\u2019t know, but she does not know if it is the same enemy because she has not been in this office for that long. This makes him angry, and he tells her that she should know better than that because he has been here for a long time. He also tells her to put all the information about the plague into her hands because he is the one who will be the one to make the report to the colonel. When the colonel asks her why she is afraid of him, she explains that she is scared of the unknown, and the unknown is causing the plague to spread throughout the country. She tells him to tell the colonel that he has to report to him, but the colonel tells her not to because he does not want to hear it. She then tells him not to worry because she knows that he will tell the truth, and she will make sure that the truth will come out.",
    "The \"chicken colonel\" throughout the story is the main character of the story. He is a colonel in charge of the Office of Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection in the Pentagon. He has been there for two years, and his replacement, Colonel Patterson, was retired ten days ago, leaving him in charge. The colonel is described as a tall, thin man with freckles and an unruly mop of hair, and he has a boyish look. When Andy first meets him, the colonel reminds him of a movie version of General Rommel, strutting up and down before his tanks. When the colonel throws a piece of paper with a scare headline about a Russian plot and germwarfare, Andy throws it at him, and the colonel hurries out of the office. When Bettijean comes back into the office with another stack of papers, she gives him a motherly smile and tells him that they are top priority now. He runs fingers through his thick, brown hair and massages his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to his wary and confused brain. He asks her to bring him all the latest reports of the latest incidents, and she brings him a pile of papers. He looks through the papers and realizes that there are no deaths yet, which is why there is no panic yet, but there is fear spreading like a plague. He tries to find a trend in the isolated mountain areas of the West and South, but these reports are too fragmentary, and doctors can't identify the poison until they have a fatality for an autopsy. He thinks about the chicken colonel, but he can't think of an enemy, so he doesn't know if it is sabotage or an enemy.

    "Herbert Hyrel sits in his easy chair, extended further toward the fireplace, and his eyes travel cautiously in the generaldirection of his wife. She is in her chair as usual, her long legs curled up beneath her, the upper half of her face hidden in the bulk of her personalized, three-dimensional telovis. She was watching one of the newer black-market sex-operas. Her face is hidden in a stereoscopic nature, seemingly bringing the performers with all their tinsel and color directly into the room of the watcher. Hyrel had no way of seeing the performers in the plastic affair she wore, but he guesses from the expression on the lower half of the face that she was watching a play. In any event, there would be no sound, movement, or sign of life from her for the next three hours. To break the thread of the play for even a moment would ruin all the previousemotional build-up. There had been a time when he hated her for those long and silent hours during which he was completely ignored. His lips curled into a tight smile and his right hand fondled the unobtrusiveswitch beneath his trouserleg. He does not press the switch. But it is comforting to know that it is there, exhilaratingto know that he could escape for a few hours by a mere flick of his finger. He let his eyes stray to the dimlight of the artificial flames in the fireplace. His hate for her is not limited merely by those lonely hours she has forced upon him, it is far more encompassing, he hates her with a deep, burningsavagery that is deadly in its passion. He hates her for her money, the money she kept securely from him, and for the paltry allowance she doled out to him. His other self materializes in a small cabin in a hidden nook between a highway and a river where he has installed the receiving set a month ago. He thinks about the girl who might be waiting for him, smiles, and presses the switch on his thigh. Then he thinks about how he would kill her and claim a rightful share of her money. He would wait until he had sucked the last measure of pleasure from the thought, and then kill her. Then, he would claim the money, berid of her debasing dominance. Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white, silken mask carefully at the door and shoved his sales slip through as it was thoroughly scanned by unseen eyes. Abuzzer sounded an instant later, the lock on the door clicked, and Hyrel pushed through into the exhilaratingwarmth of music and laughter. The main room is large. Hidden lights along the walls send slow beams of red, blue, green, yellow and pink trailing across the domed ceiling. The coloredbeams mingled, diffused, spread, and spread, caught up by mirrors of varioustints that diffused and mingled. The gay and bizarre costumes of the masked revelers on the dancefloor and at the tables, unearthly in their own way, were made even moreso by the altering light. Laughter, laughter, and utter abandonment came from the dance floor, tables, and the private booth. He had skimped for six monthsto salvage enough money from his allowance to make a down payment on the telporter suit. He sat down and ordered a bottle of cheap whiskey. When his order arrived, he consumed it eagerly while his eyes scanned the room in search of the girl. He couldn't see her in the dim swirl of color. A woman clad in the revealing garb of a Persian dancer threw an arm about him from behind and kissed him on the cheek through the veil which covered the lower part of her lowerpart of her cheek. She giggled into his ear. Havin' a time? He reached for the white arm topull her to him, but she eluded hisgrasp and reeled back.",

    "The club is very important to the society in general and the story in particular because it is where the main character, Herbert Hyrel, goes to escape from his wife\u2019s constant pestering. The club is exclusive and caters to only three things in common: money, money, self-abandonment, and a sales slip indicating ownership of a telporter suit. It is of necessity expensive, for self-telportation is strictly illegal, and police protection is high. In addition, the club has a receiving set that transports the music and images of the performers on the TV and telovis to his room by some form of electrical impulse or wave while the actual musicians and performers remain in the studio. He knows that when he presses the switch on his thigh, his higher self streams out of him along an invisible channel, leaving his body behind in the chair in a dream-like state. His other self materializes in a small cabin in a hidden nook between a highway and a river where he has installed the receiving set a month ago. He thinks about the girl who might be waiting for him, smiles at the door, thinks about how much he hates her, and thinks about what he would kill her for.

He will wait until he has sucked the last measure of pleasure from the thought, and wait until his desire for her has reached the ultimate, and he will unstopperyou quietly and sip the last soul-satisfying drop. As long as the bottle remained upon the shelf, it was symbolic of that pleasurable moment. He snapped out of his reverie and realized he had been wasting precious moments. There would betime enough tomorrow for gloating. He remembered the girl he had met the night before, and smiled smugly. Perhaps she would be waiting him even now. If not, there would be another one. He settled himself deeper intothe chair, glanced once more at his wife, then let his head lean comfortably back against the chair's headrest. His hand upon his thigh felt the thin mesh that cloaked his body beneath his clothing like asheer stocking. His fingers went again to the tiny switch. Again he hesitates.

    "The story begins with a gray, hairless, heavily built dog barking soundlessly at the other end of the Avenue of Wisdom that leads across the Peace Park. For a moment, the effect is almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of civilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy catches up with the dog and it rolls over enthusiastically at his feet, and the scene is normal again. The small boy, however, seems definitely pre-civilization. He studies the dog coldly and then inserts a thin metal tube under its eyelid and jabbed. The dog wags its stumpy tail. The boy frowns, tightened his grip on the tube, and suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach, the stifftube rebounded from the dog's hairless hide. He does not look up when someone calls: Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em! A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the luxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that, except for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog. Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice: Kill 'em. The gray dog hurled itself on Darter. Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks so short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and one pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard. The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. When he is World Director, hesaid slowly, he\u2019s going to have warfare again. Hal and Joggy blink at the unfamiliar word. The Space Fleet would take care of them, Hal replied calmly. And what if they were attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System? Hal replied that the Space Fleet does not have to worry about such a thing because they are conditioned to reject violent solutions to problems. But the Butcher bristles and says that it is impossible because the Time Bubble is just a viewer, and humans can\u2019t travel through it because they cannot change the past. The story then moves to the Time Theater, where a gray dog is barking, and a gray-haired, heavily-built dog calls out for help. A small boy caught up with him and the dog rolled over enthusiastically, and then the scene returns to normal again, but the small boy is still coldly staring at the dog. He tests the dog with a metal tube in his eyelid, which makes the dog wag its stubby tail, and jabbers the boy several times. The kid frowns and pocketes the metal tub, and when the boy calls the gray dog \u201cButch!\u201d, the dog\u201ds face splits in an upside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long, black tongue lolls. The little boy looks at the tongue speculatively, and pocketed the tub with a grimace of utter disgust when someone called \u201cSic\u2019d\u2019em,\u201d but the boy turns around when someone says \u201cThe Butcher.\u201d The story moves to a time when humans have wars and revolutions, and it took ages for them to be conditioned to behave in a different way. Hal assures the Butcher that they will not, and The Butcher counters that it does not matter what they think now, as they all do at their age. The two then go to swim over to the time theater, but The Butcher is not interested in walking them there, so they decide to go to the garbage pail instead. The older boy offers to walk The Butcher a tube, which the Butcher rejects, and they get into a fight. The fight ends with the Butcher kicking Brute in the face, and he returns to his own pit.",
    "Hal is the protagonist of the story. He is the son of the Butcher, who is the World Director of the Time Theater. He has been programmed to be a self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless. Hal is also the leader of the Space Fleet, a group of humans who patrol the planet. When Joggy and Hal are going to swim over to the time theater, he offers to walk them there, but the Butcher is not interested in walking them there. He wants to think about what he thinks about when he becomes World Director, and he does not want to have wars again. He also does not like the idea of uninj fights because he thinks they are just a pretend, like everything else, and that they are not real. He does not care about them because he is World Director and will not allow them to be used for war. The Butcher looks at Brute, the dog he has programmed to fight with him, and thinks about how he would like to have lived way back when people used to hurt each other all the time so the blood would come out. He thinks about the time when humans had wars and revolutions, and it took ages for humans to be conditioned to reject all violent solutions to problems. When he is older, he will realize that he cannot change the past because he will not be able to. Hal tells him that it is impossible because the Time Bubble is just a viewer, and humans cannot travel through the past. He tells the Butcher that he is going to be World Director when he is old enough, and the Butcher says that he will have wars. The story ends with the two of them in a fight with the Butcher.",
    "Technology plays a significant role in this society. It is the main reason why Joggy, Hal, and Butch are able to travel back in time to save the planet from the Butcher and his people. They have been programmed with the ability to see the past and change the future. This allows them to avoid war and other dangerous situations. They are also able to change the mindsets of the people in the future, which is what the Butcher is trying to do in the beginning of the story. They also have the power to control the minds of the uninj, which makes it impossible for them to harm them. This is because they are programmed to reject all violent solutions to problems because they have learned to automatically reject all kinds of violent solutions when they are older. The goal of this society is to prevent wars and revolutions because it takes ages for humans to be conditioned to reject these kinds of things.",
    "The society in this story is a pre-civilization society. The inhabitants of this society have been conditioned to reject violent solutions to all kinds of problems, such as wars, wars, and revolutions. All newborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless. This is why they have uninjes to work out on, and death games and fear houses, so that their emotions are cleared for adult conditioning. The society also has a Time Theater, which is where the protagonist, Joggy, and his friends, Hal, and Butch, are going to go to see the Time Theater. The Time Theater has a metal tube under the eyelid of the dog, which the boy uses to poke the dog\u2019s eyelid. There is also a garbage pail on the ground, and a saucer-shaped depression under each of the boys\u2019 feet, which swam along with them. In the pavement directly under the boys, there is a round, saucer shaped depression with a hole in each of them. Darter is strutting on his hind legs, looking up inquiringly at his master, but the Butcher refuses to let him into the theater. The Butcher is the World Director of the society, and he frowns at the idea of war because he thinks that humans will have wars and revolutions in the future when he is World Director. The story also describes how the society is controlled by a machine called the Space Fleet. The Space Fleet is made up of men, women, and children, and they work together to protect the planet from invaders from outside of the Solar System.

    "Ryd Randl stands, slouching a little, in the darkened footway of Burshis\u2019 Stumble Inn, as the sky over Dynamopolis comes alive with searchlights. Theshuttered glow of the bar is only a few yards off to his right, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of aship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships. Now he makes out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so overhead, and presently soft motor thunder comes down to blanket the almost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing darkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleamingminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from PiMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted up -draining the last reserves of the city\u2019s stored power, but draining them gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819, the power is coming in again. Ryd shrugs limply; the play is meaningless to him. He turns to Mury, a man about to offer him a chance for a come-back, Ryd - a chance to live again. Mury is a tall, spare man at his side, and Ryd is voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the tall man in the bar - he wished himself back in Burshs\u2019 with his first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his eyes, and the thought of being out of a job for nine years brings tears to Ryd's eyes. The other man, Mury - the stranger - is offering Ryd a chance at a life on Mars, and he is willing to walk with him. They keep walking - so fast that Ryd begins to lose his breath - and the stranger brings him back to his senses. He tells him that the ship that just landed on the Mesa was the ship from Mars, the ship they were sending with the power cylinder. Ten years ago, the Power Company of North America - the main plant by Dynamopolis - shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down outside the military bases in the Kun Lun, and Mury tells Ryd that they are sending a new shipment of power to Earth, and they need to find a way to make money. He offers him a job as a helio operator, but Ryd doesn\u2019t have the physique for Mars, so he turns him down. He has been out of work for ten years. The stranger takes him to the bar, where he serves him a drink, and asks him to come with him outside. They go through the swinging doors into the dark. When they get outside, the stranger takes Ryd by the arm and leads him to a place where he can get some money. When Ryd tries to tell the stranger that he is not a cop, he laughs and says that he has no interest in being a cop. He wants to make some money, but the stranger insists. The two go back to the place where they met ten years ago. They get into a car and go to the Spaceport, where Mury offers them a place to stay for the night. They stop at a gas station, and when they get there, they get out of the car and walk into the cold air. They return to the airport, where they meet Mury again.",
    "The story takes place on the planet of Mars. The story begins in a bar called Burshis' Stumble Inn in the city of Dynamopolis. The bar is located in the old days when it was built to be the power center of North America. Now, it is mostly deserted, and there are only a few men in the bar. There is a faint glow from the spaceport above the city, and a runway lights up the sky. The spaceport is where the ship from Mars landed, and it is where Mury and Ryd begin their journey to find Ryd Randl. The building they are in now is the headquarters of the Triplanet Freighting Company. It is a large, almost wholly deserted building with a vast, almost completely deserted offices spread over a square mile of the city. The buildings are mostly made of chrome and synthyl, and they have a stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. The man on Ryd\u2019s immediate right has a hand on his arm, and the man on his left has an expensive transparent hat slanted over the face, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that are alert and almost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wears a dark-gray cellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshs\u2019. The other man wears an expensive gray cap, and he is tall with a big, big-boned face, with an ugly, bald-nose that is yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for the thin mouth below it. He has expensive, expensive-looking eyes that gleam in the dark, and an expensive, transparent hat over his face. Mury is a tall, spare man at his side; Ryd is a helio operator, a job that he has been out of for nine years. The place is crowded with men and smoke, and half the men are asleep, on tables or on the floor. The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedges himself into the group along the bar, and Mury guides Ryd out, past the blue and gold-lit meloderge that is softly pouring out its endlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark. Outside, between lightless buildings, the stranger takes Ryd by the arm and leads him through the still-dark city. They keep walking, and after a few minutes, Ryd begins to lose his breath from the high, thin air. He turns to the stranger after a moment of silence; the stranger says that he might have known Ryd, but he has almost given up finding him tonight. The stranger offers him a chance to live again, but Ryd doesn\u2019t want to accept. The two walk through the city together, and when they get to the warehouse building, Mury hands Ryd a coin and tells him that the power is coming in again. He tells Ryd that the ship that landed on Earth ten years ago was the ship with the power cylinder that is being sent to Mars, and that the Restriction Act keeps men on Earth even if more than two in ten can live healthily on the outer world. Ten years ago, the main plant by Dynamopolis shut down outside the military bases in the Kun Lun. The warehouse building is the last to close down outside of the military base in the planet. There are no jobs for all the bums in this town, so they thought they could put that over on him again, so Ryd frowns, thinking fuzzily, but Mury offers him jobs. He leaves him a warming gulp to clear his head, and then goes down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of the place. He feels a queer upsurge of confidence in Mury's strange man; for too long he has met no sympathy and all too few men who talk his language. He speaks his language, but the stranger is not interested in his record. He says that they wouldn't take him, damnthem, said his record wasn't good enough for them. He knows all about your record, said Mury softly. He is just a man about to offer you a chance, for a come-back. He offers Ryd",
    "Mury first meets Ryd at the bar, where he offers him a drink and a chance to talk to him. When Ryd refuses the offer, Mury takes the opportunity to offer him a job as a helio operator. Mury explains that he has been out of a job for nine years and that he is looking for a way to make some money again. He offers Ryd a place to stay at Burshis\u2019 and asks him to come with him outside to talk about the power cylinder that is being sent to Earth. He also tells Ryd about the Restriction Act that keeps men on Earth even if two-thirds of them can live healthy on the outer world. Ryd is skeptical of Mury\u2019s motives, but he accepts the offer and follows Mury out of the bar into the dark. When they return to the city, Ryd realizes that Mury is telling the truth when he says that the power is coming back to Earth, which means that there are jobs for all the bums in this town again. This means that Ryd will be able to get a job again, which is what he wants. When Mury tells him that he can\u2019t take the job because he has a bad reputation, he becomes angry and tries to leave, but Mury stops him. Later, when they go to the spaceport, he offers to take Ryd on a tour to see the ship that is coming to Earth to bring power to the planet, which Ryd accepts. When he sees the ship, he tells Mury that he knows that the ship is from Mars, and that it is coming with a power cylinder. This makes Mury angry, and he tries to convince Ryd to join him, but Ryd says that he does not want to go with him because he is a good helioman and has a good reputation. When the ship arrives, he meets with Mury, who tells him about the restrictions act that keeps people on Earth from leaving the planet. He tells him to stay on Earth, and Mury offers to show him how to make money by selling him a ticket to Mars.",
    "The people on Earth are so poor that they have to rely on other people to make their living. They have no hope for the future of the planet. They live in a state of semi-despondency, with no hope of ever being able to live on Earth again. They cannot afford the luxury of living on Earth, and they live on a planet that is dying due to a lack of power and resources. The people of Earth are in debt to Mars, which is the main source of power for the planet, and are dependent on them for survival. The planet is dying, and Earthmen are not allowed to leave the planet because of the Restriction Act of 819, which prevents them from doing so. This means that Earthmen have to work for the people of Mars, and this makes them very dependent on others to make ends meet. This is a very sad state of affairs for Earthmen, and it is the reason why they are so despondent about the state of things on Earth.",
    "Ryd Randl is a young man who has been out of a job for nine years. He is a helio operator, a foreman on a ship that landed on the planet of Mars ten years ago. He has been trying to find a new job ever since, but he has not been able to find one for the past ten years. When the stranger first meets him, Ryd thinks that the stranger is a cop, but the stranger tells him that he is just a man about to offer him a chance for a come-back. Mury is a man who is working for a vast mass of men for whom he is working as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after they have borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered their hands willingly to the rebuilding of Earth, only to be refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor capitulate frankly to him. Ryd is a smart, skilled helioman, but now he is out of the habit of working, so he is no longer able to get a job. When Mury offers him a job, he accepts, thinking that he has a chance to live again. When Ryd refuses, the stranger takes him to the bar, where he is served by Burshis Yuns. There, he meets Mury, a tall, spare man at the bar who offers Ryd a drink and a chance at a life on Mars. He tells Ryd that he knows all about Ryd\u2019s record, and he knows that he will not take the job because he doesn\u2019t want to be a part of any of the Poligerents\u2019 schemes. He also knows that Mury has been working for the same people for ten years longer than Ryd, and that is why he is willing to risk his life to help Ryd.",
    "Split Campbell and his colleague, Captain Linden, are on a mission to explore a new planet. They have landed on the planet and are looking through a telescope for a view of the strange thing they have come to see: a long, silvery serpent-like thing that crawls slowly over the planet\u2019s surface. There is no way of knowing how large it is, at this distance; it might have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain, or a chain of mountains, or it might be a river of bluish-gray dough that has shaped itself into a great cable. They are able to guess that it has been moving along its course for hundreds of years. The two are sent here to learn the answers to the EGGWE Code, which requires them to explore the new planet and gather information about the human life on it. They land at what they believe to be a safe distance from the rope; if it gives off heat or poisonous gases or deadly vibrations, they prefer to keep their distance; if, on the other hand, it proves to be some sort of vegetable, they will move in upon it slowly, gathering facts as they progress. Split is working at the telescope, expecting his turn, but he doesn\u2019t even glance up from his books. He is a man of duty, and he is told to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of his \u201csplit-hairs.\u201d He is also told to go out and meet both of them. He takes the instrument from Split and takes a look at the \u201crope\u201d while the sun is on it: it is moving, and the little clouds of dust are coming up from under its belly. He then asks Split to take the photos, and they go out to see it. Split points out that they seem to be coming out of the ground, and it is possible that they are on top of an underground city. The long shadows that they see through the telescope were aprominent part of the picture I saw when I looked out the window. They were tree shadows, and I realized that they were not tree shadows when I saw them. The shadows were moving because the sun was moving across the surface of the planet. The man and the woman approach him, and two other people appear from somewhere back of her: a red-headed man in a red sash about his middle, and a girl with a red headdress over her shoulders. The girl is standing several yards away, and she is watching him. He goes through some routine motions, his moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening. Two other people approach him: a tall, slender man with a bare chest and legs, cleanly muscled, fine-mouthed, and his skin is almost the color of cream-colored robe that flows from his back. He wears a brilliant red suit, and this is matched by a red scarf that comes down over his shoulders; the girl is wearing a headdress that looks like an acircular mantle. The other person is a tall man with red hair that hangs down to the middle of his shoulders. They come from somewhere in the back of the group: a thin, muscular man with long, straight hair, and another man with short, wavy hair. The woman is a young woman, and her hair is similar to the one on the man. She is the mother of two children. They go to the telescope to take pictures of the two friends, and when they look at them, they are not visible to the naked eye. The story ends with the two of them talking to each other.",
    "Gravgak is one of the crew members of the spaceship that has landed on a new planet. He is described to be a tall, slender man with red hair and long, wavy, stubble-cut hair. He wears a bright red sash around his middle and a red headdress over his shoulders. He walks slowly along the surface of the planet, and he is accompanied by a beautiful young woman. They seem to be coming out of the ground, and Split thinks that they are coming from an underground city. When he sees them, he is certain that they have not seen their ship yet, and the two of them are fully a mile away from the ship. He explains to Split that they came up out of a barren rock hillside to view the sunset, and they have been moving along its course for hundreds of years. When they approach the ship, they are followed by two other people, who are described as tall, thin, and slender. One of them is described as a male and the other as a female. The other is a tall man with long, slender legs and a clean, muscled body. The woman is a young woman, and she introduces herself as Mrs. Deshazaway. She is the granddaughter of the current governor of Earth, and her grandfather is the current president of the Federation of Worlds. She explains to him that she is a descendant of a race that lived on Earth millions of years ago, and now she is being forced to live on this planet because of the Code. She also tells him that her grandfather was the last man to have married a woman on Earth. She says that she will marry him when she grows up, and that he will be the first to tell her the story of how he fell in love with her.",
    "The siren is the sound of the Earth\u2019s warning to the inhabitants of other planets. It is a sound that alerts the crew of the ship that something strange is happening, and they must be aware of it in order to be able to respond to it. The siren reminds them of the warning that the Earth has sent out to other planets, warning them about the dangers of interplanetary travel. The warning is significant because it is the first time that humans have been sent to a new planet, and it is also significant because they are the first to see the strange thing that they are observing: a man-like creature that crawls along the surface of the planet. The creature is described as a long, silvery serpent-like thing that is crawling slowly over the land, and its shape is similar to that of a rope. The rope is moving along its course, moving like a sluggish snake. It follows a deep-worn path between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the horizon. The two crew members, Split and Campbell, are sent here to learn the answers to the EGGWE Code, which dictates how humans should interact with other planets in the universe. The Code also states that humans should not intermarry with other species in space, and Earthmen are forbidden from intermarrying with non-Earthmen. The Siren reminds the crew members of this rule.",
    "Captain Linden is the captain of the spaceship that has landed on a new planet. He is described as a conscientious and conscientious man. He has been sent to this planet to learn the answers to the questions of the EGGWE Code regarding the human race on this planet. His job is to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of his split-hairs. His training has given him an exaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline, which makes him want to stop and weigh his words even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar is requested in his coffee. His scientific habit of thought makes him stop and think even more when speaking about the strange life forms on the planet. When he first sees the strange thing that he is observing, he asks the ship\u2019s captain, Mr. Split Campbell, to take a look at the \u201crope\u201d while he is at the telescope. The rope is a long, silvery serpent-like thing that crawls slowly over the surface of the planet, and it has been moving along its course for hundreds of years. It follows a deep-worn path between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the horizon. When Split and Mr. Campbell first see it, it is a man, like the men of the Earth, walking upright, wearing clothes, and his lungs fill with the breath of wonderment. He tells them that he has never seen a sight like that before, and he asks them to go out and meet both of them. When they go out to meet them, they see that the rope is moving, and they realize that they have landed on top of an underground city. Captain Linden orders them to stay at a safe distance from the rope because he does not want to disturb it. When the other man, a woman named Mrs. Deshazaway, approaches him, he tries to explain to her why they are there, but she refuses to listen to him. The woman explains that she is a descendant of a race called the Kallerian people, and her ancestors came to this world a million years ago. She tells him that she will marry him if he can help her solve the mystery of why humans have come to this place. She explains that they are in love with each other, but they cannot marry because the Earth has a Code that says that humans are forbidden from intermarrying with other planets. She also explains that the Earth wants no shotgun weddings of the worlds of space because Earth is the home of the universe. When Mr. Arnold asks him why he would want to marry her, he tells her that he cannot marry her because he is a member of another race. He then explains that his ancestors came here to learn more about this planet and its inhabitants. He also explains to her that if they can solve this mystery, they will be able to return to Earth.",
    "The relationship between Captain Linden and his lieutenant \"Split\" Campbell is one of duty. The two have worked together for six months on a spaceship that has just landed on a new planet in space. They are on a mission to learn more about the life on the planet. They have a very good working relationship, and it is clear from the beginning of the story that they are very much in love with each other. They work well together, and there is a lot of trust and respect between them. However, the relationship between them is also very tense, and the two are not always on the same page. The relationship between the two is tense because they both want to be loyal to their ship and its mission, and they do not want to break the rules of the EGGWE Code. They both want the best for their ship, and that is why they are willing to risk their lives for the greater good of the ship.",

A few even resolved to clipthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen orpencil was nearer at hand. Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of YourLife and Psychology that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus. He filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he had, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time. Miss Elizabeth Arnable is one of the few to whom the advertisement is unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine. The radio in her room takes the place of reading matter, and she always likes to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading would be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but whatthe cats aren't almost smart enough to read, she always said. It just so happened, however, that she had bought the copy of the Antivisectionist Gazette the day before. She pounced upon the POSATad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. She fills out the coupon and sends it past the neighborhood post office so that she can post it as soon as possible. Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in response to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information than had the original advertisement, but with considerable morevolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the key that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself - if he would just fill out the enclosed form. Don Alford, a research physicist, sees the advertisement in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired from the point of view of both a former student and a fellow researchworker. He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that some component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his brain just beyond consciousness. It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his attention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small black circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohratom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the printed matter that accompanied it. Then, because his typewriter is conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupons and inserted it in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter doesn't fit the dottedlines on the coupons, of course, but he doesn't bother to correct it. He addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was essential to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his other letters, three identical forms were mailed from the offices of the organization POSAT the next week. They differed. The first one, addressed to Miss Arnable, contained several pamphlets about the sacred cats of ancient Egypt. She wrote a check immediately, and settled into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats. After a while, she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy it, too. She was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical composition. She finished the article and began to write aloud, and after a while she began reading aloud some of her own answers. The foldedsheets of paper that he pulled forth made him stiffen with sharp surprise. Come here a minute, Betty, he called, spreading them out carefully on the dining room table. What do you make of these? She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by one. It looks like a psychological test of some sort.

    "The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth (POSAT) is an ancient secret society. It is located on the other side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. The organization is run by a man named POSAT, and it is described to be a racket of some sort. They are interested in the employment or financial position of their members, and they offer information about the secret source of those profound principles that can solve the problems of life. They also offer information on how to change the course of your life. The society is described as a secret organization, and its members are referred to as \"seemingly random\". The organization was established 400 years ago, and the first member of the society was named William Alford, a research physicist. He was a former student of Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired from the point of view of both a fellow researchworker, and he was one of the many who passed over the advertisement with the disregard accorded to any common object. He read with interest to the beginning of the article before he realized that some component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his brain that teased at him.

Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for several days. He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer, but time lay heavy upon him. He used it one evening to write the requested information about his employment (ha!) and religious beliefs, his reason for inquiring about POSAT. Without quite knowing that he did so, he communicated some of his terse answers someof his desperation and sense of futility. Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical composition. She wrote a check immediately, and settled into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats. After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy it, too. She then began to write aloud some of her own answers, and after a while, she finished the article.

Bill is an unemployed pharmacist, and Elizabeth is a member of the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth (POSAT), an ancient secret society that offers the secrets of the Cosmos and the key that will unlock the hidden knowledge within themselves. Bill and Elizabeth are both interested in the secret source of those profound principles that can solve the problems of life, so they send for the FREE booklet of explanation. When they receive the booklet, they are eager to send it to the person who will receive it. However, when they do not receive any response, they decide to send the information to the armed forces for the information. This is because they believe that the information will help them in their mission. They also believe that they will be able to use the information for their own benefit.",
    "The story begins with a man waking up in his living machine in Center Four, where he belongs. He looks at the chroner and sees that it is day 17, Month IX, New Century Three. His morningnuro-tablets have already popped from the tube, and the timer has begun to boil an egg. The egg is there because the real food allotment has been increased last month. The balance of trade with Southem has just swung a decimal or two. He rises finally, steps to the mirror, switches it to positive, and looks at himself. New wrinkles are beginning to show; the past two years are leaving traces on his appearance. He thinks about his appearance when he was with the Office of Weapons, but he doesn\u2019t want to worry about them anymore. He goes from bureau to bureau, office to office, department to department, any place where they might use a space drive expert. Whenever anyone, especially a woman, asks his name, the embarrassment becomes a crackling electric field all about him. The best tactic is just not to answer. The chief calls him in one day, he looks haggard, and he says that he\u2019s going to have to switch you to another department. How would you like to work on nutrition kits? Very interesting work. Nutrition kits? Well, I\u2014er\u2014know it sounds unusual, but it justifies. I just had the cybs work it over in the light of present regulations, and it justifies. Everything had to justify, of course. Of course there are so many regulations that if you just took the time to work it out, you could justify damn near anything. I knew what the chief was up to, to remove me from my post would have taken a year of hearings and innumerable visits to the capital in Center One. The equivalent of resigning. I\u2019ll infract, I said. He looked vastly relieved. It took a week or so. Then I was on Non-Productive status and issued an N/P book for my necessities. My new living machine is smaller, but is still comfortable, and since I was still a loyal member of the state and a verified conformist, I wouldn't starve. Yes, I still hoped for a job, even after two years. I still meant to keep on plugging, making the rounds. The timer clicked and my egg was ready. I swallowed the tablets and then took the egg to the table to savor it and make it last. As I leaned forward to sit, the metal tag dangled from my neck, catching the glowlight. My identity tag. Everything came back in a rush\u2014 My name and her voice. Would I dare? Would I start out this very morning and take the risk, the terrible risk?",
    "The State plays a very important role in the development of the Northem. It is the reason for the renumbering of the population in the society. It helps advance the warless struggle with Southem. The equator is the boundary of the two superstates, and there is no geographical difference between the two. The two states are basically the same. There is a truce, and they are both geared for war. They are both efficient states, as tightly controlled as an experiment with enzymes, as microsurgery, as the temper of a diplomat. We were renumbered, then, in Northem, and everybody now has six digits and an additional prefix or suffix of four letters. We try to pronounce them when they are pronounceable. That is, no one says to Stateleader, \u201cGood morning, A-A-A\u201d, but they say \u201cAaaa.\u201d When they are at the end of the line at the grocery store, the distributor takes his coupon book and is all ready to reach for his package when he sees the fatal letters N/P. A drone, a drain upon the State, appears and scowls at him. He scoffs at the book again, and then goes on to the end. Not sure this is in order. Better go to the other end of that line, we'll check it later. No more packages reach the counter, and the person at the counter hands the person with the coupon book a different one. You know what happens before this happens. The person who receives the new one receives a new four letter word, and he or she is no longer a member of the State. He or she becomes a non-producer, which means that they are no longer able to get any more packages. This is because they have lost the right to sell them. The people who receive the new ones become non-prosperous, which is the opposite of the status they were in before.",
    "The narrator\u2019s relationship to the mysterious voice in his dreams is very different from that of the other characters in the story. The first time he hears it, he is in his living machine in Center Four, where he belongs, and all the familiar things are about him, but he is breathing very hard. His morningnuro-tablets have already popped from the tube, and the timer has begun to boil an egg. The egg is there because the realfood allotment has been increased last month. The balance of trade with Southem has just swswung a decimal or two. He rises finally, steps to the mirror, switches it to positive, and looks at himself. New wrinkles are beginning to show; the past two years are leaving traces. He hadn\u2019t worried about his appearance when he was with the Office of Weapons. There, he was able to keep pretty much to himself, doing research on magnetic mechanics as applied to space drive. But other jobs, where you had to be among people, might be different. He needed every possible thing in his favor. Yes, he still hoped for a job, even after two years. He still meant to keep on plugging, making the rounds. The timer clicked and his egg was ready. He swallowed the tablets and then took the egg to the table to savor it and make it last. As he leaned forward to sit, the metal tag dangled from his neck, catching the glowlight.

    "The narrator\u2019s name affects his social life in a number of ways. First, it affects the way he interacts with the people around him. He is not allowed to speak to anyone without his name on the record, which makes him feel awkward and uncomfortable. Secondly, he can\u2019t change his name because his name is already on the records, which means that he cannot change it even if he wants to. Thirdly, his name also affects his ability to get a job. He cannot get a post in any of the administrative departments because he is a non-producer, so he cannot even apply for a new one. Finally, he cannot get any more packages because he has become an N/P, which is a four letter word in the system. This means that no one will give him more packages, and he is no longer a member of the state.",
    "When the narrator\u2019s name is mentioned in the first part of the story, the first person who hears it is the chief of the society. He is very embarrassed and looks down upon it. He doesn\u2019t want to pass it on to his secretarial engineer, and he tries to explain it to the administrative circuits himself. The other people in the society are also very embarrassed by it, and they try to explain to him why it is a four letter word. When the second person hears it, they are even more embarrassed. They are angry and try to tell him to leave the system, but he refuses. The third person, the secretary, is even more upset by it. She thinks that he is a liar, and that he should go back to his old job. The fourth person, a space drive expert, tries to convince him to change his name, but it is too late. The last person to hear the name is the president of the state, who is very angry and tries to tell the narrator to go away.",

Her petpoodle, whom she calls Cuddles, is his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused Gregory Malcolm\u2019s staid respectable heart to give a little lurch as he glimpses her reflected vision in the glistening walls. She is not for him, but she is already attached to the young man seated beside her, Ralph Breadon. He turned to murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and disliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich brownness of his skin, his hair, and his eyes. The sound of his own name startled Greg. Sparks, the man at the head of the table, is a stunted, usually-grinning, little red-haired man named Hannigan. He lays an anxious hand on Gregory\u2018s arm. If I was you, he said, if I was Gregory, Malcolm, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow. Greg said, Why not? Sparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering. Well, for one thing, it would only worry him. And then there is the womenfolk, they scare easy. Atmospherics don't mean nothing. I have rode out worse storms than this, plenty of times, and in worse crates than the Carefree,\u201d said Sparks. Greg studied him carefully from behind trim plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said levelly, So it is that bad, eh, Sparks? What bad? I just told you\u2014 I know. He says that he is not a professional spaceman. Sparks is not, but he does have a hobby for years, and he thinks he knows what they are up against. He turns to his colleague, the radioman, who shrugs and says that Vortices are unpredictable, and it will give them the oldchuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crackus up on an asteroid or satellite. No way of telling till it happens. And the controls are useless, so they sit tight, said Sparks, as useless as a cow in a cyclone. Malcolm nodded quietly. He takes off his spectacles, breathed on them, wiped them, and replaced them. He glared at his sister challengingly. He moved measuredly, and moved up to the dining dome. His sister sniffed, and lifted his voice again. Malcolm moved into the room. He nodded politely to the others. Then he went up to his boss, who called him \u201cSir.\u201d He nodded back. He went to his control banks, and then went back to his seat. Gregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly through the labyrinthine corridors.

He moves measuredly, and his movements are measured. J. Foster is a plump, impatient little Napoleon, who sits at the head of the table.

Gregory\u2019s secretary, however, is not for him. She is already in love with the young man, Ralph Breadon, and he is already married to her. Gregory does not want to tell them, because it would only scare the Old Man and his family.

He lays an anxious hand on Gregory, who does not think he should say anything to the boss about this. Greg does not tell them unless he has to because it will only worry him. And then there is the women, who scare easy. They will pull out of this if anybody can. And they have three good men on the bridge, Townsend, Graves, and Langhorn, who will pull them out if they can. The radiation is unpredictable, and the controls are useless, so they sit tight, and hope. Sparks says that the Vortices are unpredictable, but Gregory says that they have no way of knowing for sure until it happens. Malcolm says that there is a million-credits worth of equipment on the ship, and that it is the best space-yacht ever built. Gregory explains that he put a million dollars into this ship to make it the best it has ever been. The family is in debt to the company, and they are indebted to them for their equipment and labor.

    "Denton Cassal, a sales engineer for Neuronics, Inc., is on a long journey to see a man on the planet Godolph. He has been selected to go on a journey because he is exceptionally well matched to his instrument, and he is the best salesman that the company has. He is walking along a narrow walkway that bordered each side of the walkway, the transport tide, when a Godolphian girl wades out of the water and climbs to a walkway. She is followed by a man who is pretending interest in a merchandisedisplay. The would-be assassin is still looking at merchandise as Cassal retraces his steps. The man is a big man, physically capable of violence, but his face is mild, almost meek. The face does not fit with murder, but it doesn\u2019t fit with intelligence either. When they get close, the man freezes when they pass, and Dimanche thinks that the action he plans to take is to kill the man. Dimanche searches him for weapons, but the man is not interested in them. The thug who is trailing him is not important to anyone save the company that employs him, and possibly not even to them. Cassal turns and begins walking after the girl, and the two go to investigate his man at closer range. The woman is almost positive that she muttered a polite \u201cArf\u201d as she passed, but Dimanche does not know what she meant by it. He does not want to investigate further, and wants to report the matter to the police, but Cassal tells him to turn the problem over to the \u201cgodawful police.\u201d The police would act as if they found a body, and that is not a proper approach, so the thug wanted to kill him. The first thing he searches for is a knife, but he is unable to find it because it is a silent weapon. He decides to investigate the matter further with Dimanche, who is able to scan nervous systems, collect and interpret psychological data, but cannot read minds. The best Dimanche can do is report what a person says or subvocalizes, so he cannot find out why the man wants to kill Cassal. He tells Cassal that he is not the victim type, and is going back to the hotel and sits in a cafe. The girl passes, and Cassal goes to investigate her, but a man named Dimanche stops him. He explains that the woman is not that important to him, so they have to investigate their man at close range. They go to the alleyway that leads to the man\u2019s hotel, and when they get there, Dimanche notices that the man has a lighter in his hand. He asks Dimanche to turn off the light, and then Dimanche tells him that he has a measure of protection himself. He goes back to his hotel, where he finds a place to stay. He then goes to see the man on Tunney 21 to see if he is interested in helping him. When he gets there, he tells Dimanche that he cannot help him because he has no information about the man, so Dimanche asks him not to report. When Dimanche goes to the room, he sees that the room is empty, and there is no one on the other side of it. They decide to go back to their hotel. They get into a fight with the man who followed them, and it turns out that Dimanche is the one who is following them. He tries to get the man to drop his weapon, but they are unable to do so because the gun is hidden in his pocket. He turns to Dimanche for help, who offers him a lighter, and they go to a dark alleyway. They find the man at the end of the alley, where they find the gun.",
    "Dimanche is the main character of the story. He is an Earthman who works for Neuronics, Inc. as a sales engineer. He has been selected to go on a long journey to see a man on the planet of Godolph in order to learn more about the instrument that he is selling. Dimanche is described as a tall, thin man with brown hair and brown fur. He follows Denton Cassal, the sales engineer, as he tries to find the man who is following him on his way to see the man on Tunney. When Dimanche notices that Cassal is suspicious of the man following him, he tells him to report to the police, but Dimanche tells him that it is not safe for him to do so. He also tells Cassal that the man is not important to anyone save the company that employs him, and possibly not even to them. The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his mission, which is a commercial one, and money isn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis is right. What does the thug want? Secrets? Cassal has none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was too well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for any one this far away to have learned about it. The police would act if they found a body, his own, floating face down on some quiet street. Weapons? The first thing I searched him for was nothing very dangerous. A knife is still the most silent of weapons. He had a measure of protection himself. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He says that he can't read minds, so the best he can do is report what a person says or subvocalizes. If you\u2019re really interested in finding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem over to the godawful police. Godolph, not god awful, corrected Cassal absently. There were variousreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called Dimanche out of it. And yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as dead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn\u2019t involve too much risk. Better start moving. He\u2019s getting suspicious. Cassal goes slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of the walkway, the transport tide. He adjusts the controls of the weak force field that repezes the rain. A few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl wades out of the water and climbs to a walkway. It is this sort of thing that makes the city dangerous for a human - Venus revised, brought up to date in afaster-than-light age. Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely flexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the ribbon of transport tide flows at different levels throughout the city. The godolphian merely plunges in and is carried swiftly to his destination. Whereas a human, Cassal shivers, would be considered an accident. The girl is attractive, but not graceful. The would-be assassin is still looking at merchandise as Cassal retraces his steps. He tells Dimanche that he will investigate the man at closer range. When the girl passes, he is almost positive she muttered a polite \u201cArf?\u201d as she sloshes by. He does not know what she means by that, but he does not intend to find out. He orders Dimanche to follow her to investigate her, and they have to investigate his man at close range. He asks Dimanche for a cigarette, and Dimanche gives him a lighter to light the cigarette. When he comes to the entrance to the alley, he warns Dimanche of the dangers of the alley. He's at the entrance, walkingfast. He lights the cigarette and follows the man. The man follows him.",
    "Cassal is on his way to Tunney 21 to see a man. He has been selected to make a long journey, the first part of which already lies behind him.

On the basis of these qualifications, he is selected to be selected to go on a long trip. He had to goto the man who is following him. That man is not important to anyone save the company that employs him, and possibly not even to them.

Dimanche needed a good stiff course insemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man coulddie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He also had a measure of protection himself. Report. Not necessarily final. Let's have it anyway. His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. Forsome reason you can't get off this planet. That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand star systems were waiting for him. Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was atransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here. Still, it wasn'tunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances are not asreliable as they might be. Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with that delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He wasself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?",
    "Murra Foray is a native of the planet Godolph. She is described as having brown hair and wearing a clean, brown fur. She follows Dimanche around the city as he tries to find the man who is following him. Dimanche thinks that she is the one who is trying to kill him, but he doesn\u2019t want to believe that. He wants to investigate the matter further, so he tells her to go back to the hotel and wait for a taxi. When she returns to the walkway, she tells Dimanche that the man she is following is not important to anyone save the company that employs him, and possibly not even to them. The thug trailing him is not interested in Cassal himself, his mission, which is a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money is not the objective, if Dimanche\u2019s analysis is right. What does the thug want? Secrets? Cassal has none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was too well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for any one this far away to have learned about it. The police would act if they found a body, his own, floating face down on some quiet street. Weapons? The first thing I searched him for. Cassal strangled slightly. A knife is still the most silent of weapons. A man coulddie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of protection himself. Report, said Dimanche, not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on tenuous evidence. His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. Forsome reason you can't get off this planet. That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousandstar systems were waiting for him. Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was atransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here. Still, it is not unusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances are not asreliable as they might be. Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with that delay? Dimanche believes that he is self-deluded or does he have access to information that Cassal does not?",
    "The story takes place on a planet called Godolph. It is described as a place where the natives like rain. The planet is a weather-controlled planet with a weak force field that repeels the rain. There is a transport tide that flows throughout the city, and there is a narrow walkway that bordered each side of the walkway. The city is filled with narrow, dark, oily, slow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on the other, and tall buildings with high ceilings. The main character, Denton Cassal, is a sales engineer for Neuronics, Inc. He has been selected to go on a long journey, the first part of which already lies behind him. He had to goto Tunney 21 to see a man that is not important to anyone save the company that employs him, and possibly not even to them. The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his mission, which is a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money isn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis is right. What does the thug want? Secrets? Cassal has none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was too well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for any one this far away to have learned about it. The police would act if they found a body, his own, floating face down on some quiet street. Weapons? The first thing I searched him for was nothing very dangerous. A long knife, a hard striking object. Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course insemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man coulddie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. The Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. She muttered a polite Arf? as she sloshed by. He doesn't know and doesn't intend to find out. He is almost positive that she meant by that, but he doesn't want to investigate further because it might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it doesn't involve too much risk. He looks up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk. It would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he could walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea? A Godolphi city is peculiar, and, though not intended, it is peculiar to be suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian is at a definite disadvantage. And yet, the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as dead. It might be better to investigate it further, it seems. He looked aroundapprehensively. He sees a man who is pretending interest in a merchandisedisplay. A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently, he is not used to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing up and down silently. It was a godolphian axiom that all travelers are crazy. He stalks after the man, looking at merchandise as Cassal retraces his steps. The would-be assassin is a big man, physically capable of violence, but his face is mild, almost meek. The face doesn\u2019t fit with murder, it does not fit with something that is out of character. His mind freezes when they get close. He can feel his shoulderblades twitching as they pass, projecting to Dimanche the action he plans to take. The knife is still silent, a man could die from it, and a knife is a perfect engineering material. The transport tide flows at break-neck speed, and the Godolphians merely plunge in and noiselessly make their way to their destination. The man follows Cassal for a few days, and he is carried swiftly to his destination. When he gets there, it would be easy enough for him to elude him in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing is normal. The streets are brightly lighted, and in an hour the streets will be brightly lit. The native eyes are dim, so a human would consider it dim. There are no native eyes. The street is dark, and it is very cold. The godolphians have a miserable climate. A few hundred feet away, a girl wades out of the transport tide and climbs to a small cafe. She stalks into a walkway, warm, bright and dry. He might find safety for a time.",
    "Jorj Helmuth, the President of the Thinkers\u2019 Foundation, wakes up in his bedroom in the Thinker\u2019s Foundation. He thinks about a project that is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on the future of mankind in deep space. He speaks to his steno-robot for Rocket Physicist and Genius Class, who dictates to him a brief message about the project. The President is waiting to see Maizie, who is asleep next to him. He has the general staff with him. Jorj thinks about how he should have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth their relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would send her into deep trance trembles on the tip of his tongue. But no, that special power of his over her is reserved for far more importantpurposes. Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence into his 60-years-old mind, the president rises from his bed and walks to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly-planted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face breaks into a smile. It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game makingup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of his best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-savingtechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time assomno-learning. He sets his who?-where? robot for rocket physicist and genius class, who dictated to him the following brief message: Dear fellow scientist, a project is contemplated by the Government that will help mankind's future in space. Ample non-military Government funds are available. He goes to the Institute for Advanced Studies, where he meets with Willard Farquar, an old physicist and Willard's son. The two talk about the importance of the project, and the president tells him that he will be down in a few minutes. The president is waiting for him, and he has a clear feminine voice that announces Martian peace to him; he has the president with him, so he tells him I\u2019ll be down soon. He turns on the Educational Sandman in the middle of the phrase, applying tensor calculus to the nucleus, and casts his mind to the limits of the world and his knowledge. It is a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he notes, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning. He next clears his memory chains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep, and holds his finger on a bedside button that rotates the polarizing window panes until the room fills with amuted daylight. Then, he turns his head to look at the remarkably beautiful blonde girl asleep beside him. Suddenly, he feels a pang of exasperation, but he quickly quells it with a higher and dispassionate level from which he can look down on the girl and even himself as unintelligent animals. He wonders if he shouldn\u2019t have used the word \u201cthinkers\u201d on her. Still, he grumbles silently that Caddy might have had enough consideration to clear out before he wakes. The grizzled general is thinking uneasily, and, like the President, thinks that this is a very odd link in the chain of command. The gray general thinks about the resemblance between Papal infallibility and the dictates of the machine. The burly Secretary of Space, the Secretary of State, is remembering what he has taken such pains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success with Buddhism. Sitting before his guru, his teacher, feeling the Occidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had felt a little like this.",
    "Maizie is the daughter of Jorj Helmuth, the president of Thinkers\u2019 Foundation I. She is described as a beautiful blonde girl who is described to be very intelligent and intelligent. She works in the Thinker\u2019s Foundation. She has built a robot for Rocket Physicist and Genius Class that communicates with the brain of the Thinkers. She also has built-in controls that make her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity\u2019\u2019 right-minded leaders. The gray general is thinking uneasily of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and the dictates of the machine. The burly Secretary of Space, who is also gray, thinks that this is a very odd link in the chain of command. The grizzled general thinks that the machine with a million times more synapses than the human brain is the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the rims of molecules instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney Island shimmying of columns of mercury. This machine is the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased human judgment and feeble human ambition have evolved. This is the computer that really thinks - a million-plus! - and this machine that can think to the limits of the world and its knowledge. The President of the United States feels a chord that hasn\u2019t been sounded for decades, the dark and shivery organ chord of his Baptist childhood. Here, in a strange sense, he stands face-to-face with the living God: infinitely stern with the sternness of reality, yet infinitely just. No tiniest error or wilful misstep could ever escape scrutiny of this vast mentality. He shivers. He thinks about how he should have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth their relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would send her into deep trance trembles on the tip of his tongue. But no, that special power of his over her is reserved for far more important purposes. Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence into his 60-year old mind, the 40 year-old Thinker rose from bed.

    "The Thinkers are a group of people who work at the Thinkers\u2019 Foundation in New York City. They are the ones who control the robot that Jorj Helmuth uses to communicate with the President of the United States. They have been working on a project that will have a crucial bearing on man\u2019s future in deep space for the past three-quarters of a century, and they are significant to the story because of the fact that they are able to think in terms of logic and reason. The Thinkers have built a machine with a million times more synapses than the human brain, and the machine remembers by cutting delicate notches in the rims of molecules instead of the Coney Island shimmying of columns of mercury. Their goal is to create a machine that can think independently of all other machines in the system, which is the goal of the organization. They also have a special power over Maizie, which makes them able to manipulate her into falling in love with him. The President is waiting to see them this afternoon, and he has the general staff with him, so Helmuth goes down in a few minutes.

He has been working on this project for the past three-quarters of his life, and it is revealed that he is actually the Second Coming of Man, who will be the one to save humanity from the destruction caused by the atomic bomb.

    "Mr. Oak enters Mr. Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called Raven\u2019s Rest only twice before. The third time is no better; ShalimarRavenhurst is one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it comes to personal relationships, he is utterly incompetent. He could make anyone dislike him without trying. He is sitting behind his mahogany desk, his eyes focused on the operation he is going through with a wineglass and a decanter. He doesn\u2019t look up at him as he says: Sit down, Mr. Oak, Will you have some Madeira? I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. He keeps his eyes fixed on his work: It is not easy to pour wine on a planetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter per second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have to be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low as ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting right out of the glass again. The momentum it builds up is enough to make it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it allover the place. Besides which, even if it didn\u2019ts splash, it would take it so long to fall a few inches that you\u2019d die of thirst waiting for it. Ravenhur had evolved a technique from long years of practice. He tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edgestouching, like you do when trying to pour beer without putting ahead on it. As soon as the wine wetens the glass, the adhesive forces at work will pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action on a low-gee asteroid, you do not need a capillary, by any means. The negative meniscus on the wine is something to see; the first time you see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and throwing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force. He takes the glass he offered and sips at it. He puts the stopper back in the decantern, picks up his own glass, and takes a swig of his own. Not until he puts it back down on the desk again does he raise his eyes and look at Mr.Oak, the first man to speak to McGuire after he had been activated. He tells him that he is afraid that he abrogated his contract, and that he will not be able to get back the fee he gave him. He also tells him to stop all this yak about an abandoned contract and get to the point, I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through your own actions that I find myself in a very trying position and that your sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage. He goes on to explain that the robotocists at Viking have sabotaged the MGYR-7 in order to prevent any further sabotage by unauthorized persons. The robotocs at Viking tell him that the first person who addressed orders to it will thenceforth be considered its master, and the robot will no longer be considered a human being because the problem of defining the term \u201chuman being\u201d to a robot is still unsolved. He explains that it would be much easier to define a single individual, and it would prevent the issuing of conflicting orders to the robot, provided the single individual were careful in giving orders himself. Now, it appears that you are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey, and he asks him, is that purely rhetorical, or are you losing your memory? He asks him if he is losing his memory? I had explained all that to him two weeks ago, when he brought McGuire and the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up what had really happened. Mr.",
    "Mr. Oak is the manager of the Viking Spacecraft company. He has been working on the McGuire-type ships to put the company ahead of every other space craft company in the Solar System. He is certain that the robot ship is the answer to the transportation problems in the solar system. He wants to go to Ceres and co-operate with the robotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 arrives, he will be the first man to give orders to the robot. He also wants to get the bugs out of the robot, but he cannot because the robot will not allow his brain to be tampered with. He does not want to lose his position at Viking because if he does, some of his other managerial contractsmight be canceled, and Ravenhurst might find himself out of his managerial business entirely. Mr. Oak, Mr. Ravenhurst, you have caused me considerable trouble. I thought we\u2019d hashed all that out, but it appears that there were more ramifications to youraction than we had at first supposed. His voice has the texture of heavy linseed oil. He waits, as if he expected me to make some reply to that, when I didn\u2019t, he goes on, I fear that you have accidentally sabotaged McGuire. The self-preservation \u201cinstinct\u201d has come to the fore, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further attempts are made to disrupt his thinking processes. I cannot say that I blame him, I said. What do you want me to do? Goto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy? It is too late for that. He looked suddenly very grim and very determined. He looks at me and tells me that he will not pay me the fee I have demanded. I have been banking on this ship to put Viking ahead of other spacecraft companies in the system, and I am certain that it will solve all transportation problems. He gives me a message that I should listen to, but I do not respond. He goes on to say that he is not a student of the classics, and that he would like you to go with him to Ceres. I'd have said it out loud, [8] but I was fairly certain that Shalimar Ravenhurst was not in the classics. He says that he does not need to go because he is smart, all right; it is just that when it comes to top-ersonal relationships, he is very wise. He asks questions like Who are you? By RANDALL GARRETT I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called Raven\u2019s Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; ShalimarRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it came to personal relationships he is utterly incompetent. He could make anyone dislike him without trying. When I entered the office, he was sitting behind his mahogany desk, his eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass and a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said: Sit down. He had explained all that to him two weeks before, when he brought McGuire and the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up what had really happened. He shook his head, making his jowls wobble. No, they cannot because they cannot, they failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely removing the memory banks and refilling them with new data can this bias be eliminated. There are two very good reasons, he says, and there is a shade of anger in his tone. In the first place, that sort of operation costs money, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and make the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of the improvements that the robots now feel are necessary. I just continued to keep my voice calm. If you are trying to get back the fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think you'd win. He doesn't think he is a fool, he said heavily, I am not a fool. If I were trying to pay you another fee, I would hardly offer to pay him another one. He did not think he was a fool either. He was merely trying to point out to you that it is through your own actions that he finds himself in a very trying position and that your sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage. I shall. He tells him to stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the point.",
    "The relationship between Mr. Oak and Mr. Ravenhurst started out as a professional relationship. He hired him because he was the first man to speak to the MGYR-7 after it was activated, and he wanted him to be the first person who addressed orders to the robot. However, the relationship between the two men has changed over the course of the story, and now they are no longer professional partners, but rather business associates. The two men do not see eye to eye, and it is clear from the beginning that they are not on the same page when it comes to each other. They do not treat each other well, and there is a feeling that there is some sort of power dynamic between them. When the robotocists at Viking try to sabotage the robot, they are thwarted by the fact that the robot is commanded by a human being, and the human is the only person who can change the robot's mind. This is because the robot has a self-preservation 'instinct' that prevents it from being tampered with, and this is the reason why the robot does not allow the technicians and robotocs to enter the ship. The only person that can change that is the human who is in charge of the ship, which is Mr. McIvers.",
    "The flitterboat is a small, lightweight ship that is used to travel between planets in the Solar System. The ship is similar to a miniature version of the MGYR-7, except that it is made of metal rather than steel. It has a low viscosity and low gravity, which makes it very difficult for it to move on a low-gee asteroid. When it is not being used for transportation, it is used for scientific purposes, such as for research. It is also used to transport cargo to and from the ship. When the ship is not in use, it goes back and forth between the ship and the ship it is meant to serve.",
    "The current version of McGuire is very different from the previous ones. The first version of the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after activation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth be considered its master. As I understand it, the problem of defining the term \u201chuman being\u201d to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that it would be much easier to define a single individual. That would prevent the issuing of conflicting orders, provided the single individual were careful in giving orders himself. Now, it appears that you, Mr. Oak, were the first person to speak to McGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct? Is that question purely rhetorical, I asked him, putting on my bestexpression of innocent interest. Or are you losing your memory? I had explained all that to him two weeks before, when I brought McGuire and the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up what had really happened. My sarcasm didn\u2019t faze him in the least. Rhetorical. It follows that you are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey. This time, I was giving himmy version of genuine innocence. [7] A man has to be a good actor to bea competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that Iknew a great deal more about the problem than he did. He shook his head, making his jowls wobble. No, they cannot. They realize now that there should be some way of making that change, but they failed to see that it will be necessary. Only by completely restoring McGuire\u2019s memory banks and refilling them with new data can this bias be eliminated. There are two very good reasons, and there is a shade of anger in his tone. In the first place, that sort of operation costs money, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and make the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of the improvements that the robotocs now feel are necessary, in other words, build the MgyR-8, which is precisely what I hired you to prevent. I was reluctant to call you in again because it has already cost you money. He ignored me. I even considered going through with the rebuildingwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first six models. He scowls at me. It seems, he goes on, that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to be tampered with. The self-preservation \u201cinstinct\u201d has come to the fore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocciers enter his hull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further attempts are made to disrupt his thinking processes. I can't say that I blame him, I said. What do you want me to do? Goto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy? It is too late for that. I have been banking on the McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every otherspacecraft company in the System. He looked suddenly very grim and very determined. He is certain that the robots are the answer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake of every human being in the solar system, we must get the bugs out ofMcGuire! What's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody, I quoted to myself. I'd have said it out loud, [9] but I was fairly certain that Shalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics. Mr. Ravenhurst, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with therobotocists at Viking. When the robots arrive, they will be able to communicate with McGuire.",
    "The story begins with Starrett Blade crouching in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. He is waiting for Devil Garrett to come down to the water\u2019s edge to search for him. For eight years, Star has been the top space pirate in the void. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting Garrett. He was sitting on a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his great weight. He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said, \u201cAh, Mr. Garrett.\u201d He straightened, and saw the leveled gun from the corner of his eye. He got the jet-gun in his right hand, the knife in his left, and flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only as many seconds. Star tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust bothelectron blade and jet gun into his belt. He straightens again, and sees the face of Devil Garrett. That brings Star up from his daze, and he stands there, not staring, just looking at Garrett. The most famous killer in the universe is big, tall, and twice as strong as he looks. He wears a huge high-velocity jet- gun, and a set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He smiles at Star and says that he has known it was him ever since he flashed that beam at the ship. Star stands quiet, and looks straight into Garrett's eyes. Garrett's lips twist into a smile, and Star says he is thinking of putting an electronfire-blade into his face, and Garrett laughs. Star gets up, and someone drives a fist against the base of Star's skull. He wakes up in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the door tells him that he is to be executed after Mr. Blade and the lady have eaten. Star yells at him and the man goes out. Star got up. His head spun at first, but the daze left in his head quickly cleared away. He felt forvarious weapons which he had hidden about him. He found them gone. Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from physical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. But other things were bothering him, like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each trying to shove it in a different direction. There was the girl, Miss Hinton. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind first. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression that he was Blade, so that he could kill Star as Garrett. Obviously, the reason for that was to kill Star.",
    "Garrett is the most famous space pirate in the void. He is six feet tall and twice as strong as he looks. He wears a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and a set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting on a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his great weight. He smiles at Starrett Blade, and there is a touch of hell in his smile. He says that he has known it was Starrett since he flashed that beam at his ship, and Star is afraid that the beam will hold out as far as Garrett\u2019s luck is concerned. Garrett doesn\u2019t have anatomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it out, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There is no water power, for there is no running water. There are only lakes, and tidal power is out, for Alpha III has no moon. One was the dark-haired girl, andthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes. Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. Itwas the face of a man, the man was Devil Garrett. That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he hadbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking at Garrett. The man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. Star landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug into the man's heart. Star tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust his bothelectron blade and jetgun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the leveled gun from the corner of his eye. He got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into a dive. The three actions took only as long as a second, and he was safe in coming up from behind the spur of stone to fire his own gun. He stopped, and stood for a second to stare at the girl. She was something to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her next move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five tall, black-haired, dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would make anyone stop and gulp. Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jeton him, and said in a trembling voice, Drop those weapons, or I'll blast you. Star got up. His head spun and he almost fell at first, but the daze left in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for various weapons which he had hidden about him. He found them gone. Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from physical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course.

    "The story takes place on the planet AlphaCentauri III. It is called the most barren planet in space. There are no running water, only lakes, and there is no moon. The planet has no moon, but there are vast amounts of electronic machinery. The story begins with Starrett Blade, the protagonist, crouching in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, are the only things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of the planet. Ten minutes ago, Star Blade\u2019s ship had spun into the stagnant waters before him. He is waiting for Devil Garrett, the most famous space pirate in the void, to come down to the lake to search for him. For eight years, Star had been hunting Garrett, and on a tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy beam had stabbed up at his ship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake. He stands there, not staring, just looking at Garrett. The man walks to the water's edge, and peeks out over the pool. Star landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock.

    "Garrett is trying to leave the impression that he is Starrett Blade, so that he can kill Starrett. He has shown papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of Starrett in the past. He is also trying to get Starrett to kill him before the authorities connect with Section Void Headquarters so that they can collect the reward that is offered on him. The girl, Miss Hinton, is aware of the identity of Garrett, and she is aware that Starrett is not a pirate. She is also aware that Garrett is the most famous space pirate in the void, and he has been hunting Starrett for eight years. Garrett is also doing this to make Starrett believe that the girl is the real Starrett and not the real Garrett. He also tries to make her believe that Star is the one who flashed the beam at Garrett\u2019s ship, and that he will be executed before a stellar vision screen connected with Section Void Headquarters. Starrett does not want to kill Garrett, so he tries to convince her that he really is Garrett. Garrett does this by showing her a picture of him, and then by having Starrett kill him. This makes the girl believe that she is actually Starrett, and Starrett kills him.",
    "At the beginning of the story, Starrett Blade is hiding in a small lake on the planet of AlphaCentauri III. He is waiting for the arrival of a space pirate named Garrett, who is the most famous space pirate in the void. He has been searching for Star for eight years, and he has earned the nickname \u201cDeath Star\u201d because of his fighting prowess and his reputation as a killer. Star is a tall, dark-haired man with black hair and a face that looks like silken spundark. His fighting prowess has earned him the nickname of \u201cStarrett Blade.\u201d He is described as tall, black-haired, and dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would make anyone stop and gulp. When Garrett comes down the trail that leads to Star\u2019s hiding place, he is heavily armed and wears a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and a set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting in a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his great weight. He smiles at Star, and there is a touch of hell in the smile. He says that Star is thinking of putting an electronfire-blade into his face, and Star says that he\u2019ll kill him before a stellar vision screen connected with Section Void Headquarters. Garrett laughs and says he wishes the authorities to see Garrett die, so that he might collect the reward that is offered on him. Star stands quiet, and looks straight into Garrett\u2018s eyes. He stands there, not staring, just looking at Garrett. The most famous killer in the universe is big, tall, and twice as strong as he looks. He wears huge jet-guns, and is sitting on a chair that is made of steel; he is sitting next to Star, who has crashed into the lake. Star tosses the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrusts his bothelectron blade and jetgun into his belt. He straightens, and sees the leveled gun from the corner of his eye, sees the knife in his right hand, and goes into a dive that flips him behind a rock. The three actions took only as long as a second and the blast from the jetgun flaked the rock where he had been standing. He knows that he is safe because Garrett knows how to slide another blast-capsule into place. Star shoots the girl with his own gun, and when he wakes up in a cell, he finds that his weapons are gone. He thinks about the girl, and she tells him that her name is Hinton, and that she is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Blade. He wonders why she always seems to jump into his mind first, and why Garrett is trying to leave the impression that he was the girl first. Star tries to convince her to marry him, but she says that she will only marry Mr. Blade if she can prove that Garrett is not who he says he is. When Star wakes up, he realizes that his ship has landed on a different planet, and Garrett is no longer the man he is, but a woman named Miss Hinton. Star thinks about how he would like to kill her, but he cannot because there is no way for him to kill Garrett because he is not a pirate. He decides to use his knife to make her marry him.",
    "The story begins with a group of people on the surface of the Moon exploring the Mare Serenitatis, or Sea of Serenity. They are on a mission to find proof of an alien race that has occupied the moon for over a year. They find a strange metal object that has never been seen before, and they decide to see if they can figure out what it is and why it has been there for so long. They discover that it is made of a perfect sphere that is at least two miles in diameter. They decide to call Lunar City to learn more about it, but they are interrupted by the sound of static in their radios, which makes them realize that there is no static between inter-lunar radio, which is unheard of on the Moon. Kane and his wife, Verana, go to investigate the strange object, while Miller, the mineralogist, and Kane\u2019s wife, Marie, stay behind to find out more information about it. They see strange drawings on the walls and gadgets that look like controls for something, and their suits become slack and dangling on their bodies. They realize that they must have been trapped in this place for at least a thousand years because the door to the room they are in suddenly closes, leaving them frozen in place. After a few minutes, they realize that the door is a circular opening in the wall, and that there must be a small room inside. They go through the small room, and there is a round, circular opening. There is a metal panel with a small cut in the side, and it slides across the passage. The group goes through the door, and when they get to the end of the room, there is an inner door. They enter the inner room, where they find a series of doors without any handles or locks. They knock on the doors, and one of them opens, revealing a large, circular room with a smooth, hard metal surface. The walls are covered with strange drawings and instruments, and the room is filled with kaleidoscopic lights that pulsate rhythmically. They turn off the oxygenating machines that supply oxygen to the suits, and take off their helmets to breathe the air in the room. Kane, the pilot, notices that the walls are smooth and clean, and he realizes that they are made of steel, a much stronger alloy than the ones on Earth. He and his team decide to explore the rest of the building, but the door closes, trapping them in the strange room. They try to call the authorities, but their radio is receiving static, so they have no way of knowing if they are being listened to or not. They leave the room and go back to their suits, where their suits are still breathing the air. They hear a voice on the radio, but it is not the same as the one they are used to hearing. The voice tells them that they will be famous if they discover proof of the alien race, and so they go to the radio again, and this time, they are able to connect with the person on the other end. The person is a man named Miller, who is sixty years old. He is an excellent mineralogy professor, alert and alert, but with a body that is almost feeble. He steps into the passageway, and for a brief second, he is framed in the opening, a dark silhouette against the star-studded sky. The next second he is thrown twenty yards into the air, and suddenly, he hits the ground. He cries out in pain, and then falls on a spot beyond their angle of vision. The object is a curving, smooth metal, made of something that looks like steel, and is about a quarter of an inch deep. They begin to realize that it must be two miles wide and one mile in diameter, and are puzzled by the shape of the object. They open a door in the passage, and go through it, and discover a large room.",
    "The story takes place on the surface of the Moon. The first part of the story is set in the Mare Serenitatis, also known as the Sea of Serenity, a vast expanse of pumice covered in a calm sea. There is a circular opening in the smooth, hard metal. The walls of the room are covered with strange drawings and instruments, and kaleidoscopic lights pulsate rhythmically. The room is twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The ceiling is only a few inches above our heads, and when I looked at the smooth smooth metal, I felt as if I were trapped in some alien vault. There are also strange drawings on the walls and gadgets that look like controls for something. The story then moves to the end of the corridor, where Kane stops before a blank wall. The sweatiness of his face glistens dully; his chest rises and falls rapidly. Kane is a pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of metal between Earth and the Moon, so his temper gets the best of him. He is excited easily, but he is also a bit of a nervous wreck when the door to the room suddenly closes. He and his wife, Verana, walk slowly, examining the strange construction of the building, and Kane points out that the walls are featureless, and the walls have outlines of doors without handles or locks. He pushes through the door, and there is a small room inside. He tells his wife that there is oxygen in the place, so they might as well breathe the air in this place and save their supply. After a few minutes, the door opens, revealing a long, narrow corridor with a smooth, smooth metal wall. Kane, his wife and Verana walk through the room, and a metal panel appears on one side of the door. They turn on the radio controls to connect to Lunar City, but there is no static between inter-lunar radio, which makes them think that they are in outer space. They decide to call the authorities, but the static sounds are not the same as when they broadcast to Earth. They realize that they must be on the Moon to be able to communicate with Lunar City. The next room is an inner door, which they go through, and it has an invisible solid wall with a small cut in the top. The third room is a control room, which is where the radio is located. The fourth room is the control room of the ship, which has an intercom. The fifth room is where they find Miller, who is a mineralogist.",
    "Kane\u2019s violent drinking outburst has an effect on the story because he is the one who initiates the interaction with the alien race. He is the first one to notice the strange metal object, and he is also the one to make the discovery of the perfect sphere. This is significant because it is the only one that has been noticed before, and it is his discovery that leads to their discovery. Without his discovery, they would not have been able to find a way to save the oxygen in their suits and save their supply. Without him, they might not have discovered the secret of the place in the first place, and without him, their supply of oxygen would not last as long as it did.",
    "Marie is the wife of Miller, an excellent mineralogist. She is frightened by the alien-ness of the thing and yet she wants to be with her husband. She hesitates momentarily, then climbs through the passage. When she sees the passage, she climbs through herself and turns to help Miller, a sixty-year-old geologist, through the opening in the opening. She sees the strange metal object that protrudes from the surface of the Moon, and she wonders why it hasn\u2019t been noticed before. She asks her husband, Kane, to call Lunar City and see if they can help her. When he refuses, she realizes that they must be in outer space because there is no static between their radios when they broadcast to Earth. She turns off the oxygenating machines and removes her husband\u2019s helmet. When they enter the room, she sees strange drawings on the walls and gadgets that look like controls for something. She also notices that the walls are covered with strange drawings and instruments that pulse rhythmically. She goes to see her husband and asks him to call the authorities about it. He tells her that they will be famous if they discover proof of an alien race on the Moon. She realizes that the more they discover for themselves, the more famous they\u2019ll be. She calls the authorities, and they tell her husband to leave it alone. She then sees that there is a metal door at the end of the room. They go through the door and find a small room with a circular opening. There is a series of doors with the outlines of doors without handles or locks. She climbs through one of the doors and sees that it is made of steel, a much stronger alloy than on Earth, and that it must be at least several thousand years old. She tries to call her husband through the radio, but it is not working, so she goes through the other door. She finds the radio controls to connect to Lunar City, but they are not working. She decides to turn off the air-circuit in her spacesuit, so that she and her husband can breathe the air in the room and save the oxygen in their suits. They see that the door is closed, so they decide to explore the rest of the building. They find a control room, and there is an inner door with a smooth, hard metal surface. They turn on the radio and see that there are no radio controls on the other side of the door. They realize that they are in an alien spaceship. They decide to go to the control room and find out more about the shape of the metal object. They open the inner door, and it is full of gears, gears, tubes, and gears. They are able to turn them on and off with the radio. They discover that the metal is made from a perfect sphere that is two miles in diameter. They try to call for help, but the radio is not picking up. They leave, and go back to their ship.",
    "Ed and Verana are married to each other on the surface of the Moon. They have been married for nine months and have two children together. They are both mineralogists, which is why they have been on the Moon for so long that they have developed a close relationship with each other\u2019s work. Ed is a pilot and one of the prerequisites for the job of guiding tons of metal between Earth and the Moon, so he is very excited about the mission. Verana, on the other hand, is a pale pale woman who is frightened by the alienness of the thing and yet wants to be with her husband. She hesitates momentarily, then climbs through the passage. She is frightened of the alien nature of the place, but she wants to see her husband and wants to help him. When they see the strange metal object, they decide to go in and see what it is. They realize that it is a perfect sphere, which means that it must be at least two miles in diameter. They decide to call Lunar City and see if they can find some proof of an alien race, but they are afraid that they will be famous if they tell the authorities about it, so they leave it to their own devices to make the call. Miller is an excellent mineralogist, alert and alert, but with a body that is almost feeble, and he steps into the passageway. For a brief second, he is framed in the opening, a dark silhouette, and the next second he is thrown twenty yards into the air. He gasped in pain when he hits the ground. The next second, something pushes him and he falls on the ground, and they realize that he had fallen on a spot beyond their angle of vision. He starts through the circular opening, and his eyes are on the smooth, curving metal that protrudes from the surface. The incongruity is so awesome that for several minutes, they remain motionless and quiet. Miller breaks the silence with his quavering voice, Strange someone didn\u2019t notice it before. The object rose a quarter of a mile above them, and it is strange that it has not been noticed before. Men have lived on the moon for over a year, but the Moon is vast and the Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity) covered three hundred and forty thousand square miles. It is alien and yet it is not a natural formation, so it must have made the thing, whatever it is, and is at least several thousand years old. They look at each other and then at the inviting corridor beyond the open door. The walls of the room are covered with strange drawings and instruments, and there are kaleidoscopic lights that pulse rhythmically. Kane and his wife walk slowly, examining the strange construction of the strange structure, and their suits are slack and dangling on their bodies. The room is twelve feet long and nine feet wide. The ceiling is only a few inches above their heads, and when they look at the smooth smooth metal, it feels as if they are trapped in some alien vault. They turn off the radio controls on their spacesuits, and Kane turns off the oxygenating machines, so that they can breathe the air in this place and save their supply. They see strange drawings on the walls and gadgets that look like controls for something, and one by one, they remove their own helmets. They enter a small room inside, where there is an inner door with a circular opening. Kane presses his shoulder against the door and pushes the door, and a metal panel slides across the opening. The door is unyielding. He manipulated the air-vent controls of his spacesuit, allowed a small amount of air into his helmet, and inhaled cautiously. He waits and nothing happens. He turns off his oxy-artificial breathing machines and removes his helmet. He suggests that they might as well breathe the oxygen in the space in the room and save the oxygen supply later. They move on to the next room inside.",
    "The story begins with Shano, an Earthman, on a spaceship, waiting for his ship to arrive from Venus. The ship has landed at the spaceport. The captain, Captain Menthlo, asks him to sign a waiver stating that he is traveling at his own risk. He tells Shano to stay in his cabin as much as possible because the ship is going to take off in a few hours. Shano is nervous because he has heard about the Uranian devils, and he has been warned that they are dangerous. He is anxious to get back to his home planet, Pluto, because it has been so long since he has seen it, and his lungs have been fighting gas. He also thinks of the uranium mines of Pluto, and thinks of his gum-clogged lungs. He tries to sign the waiver, but the captain reminds him that there is a red signal, which means that the ship must be shut down, and the passengers must return to the ship in ten minutes. When Shano arrives at the air lock, the captain tells him that they must return in five minutes, and that the captain is making a call about a nearby enemy fleet. The air lock is shut off, and Shano hears oxygen being pumped into his lungs through a pipe in the cabin. He goes to the control room, where the captain talks to the pilot, and then to Shano in the ship\u2019s control room. He asks Shano if he wants to go home, but Shano says that he has a right to stay on the ship, and tells the captain to shut down the ship. He then goes to his cabin, where he is met by the lieutenant, who refuses to let him board because the captain has warned him about the danger of the Uranians. After a while, Shano goes outside and sees the captain and the crew of the ship talking about how the enemy fleet is out there, listening for any mechanical or electronic disturbance. He decides to go to the airlock, and when he does so, the air supply is cut off, leaving him stranded on the deck. He hears the captain again, and this time, he tells him to go back to the cabin because the oxygen supply has been cut off. When he goes outside, he sees the officers and men, their faces tight with fear and anger, and realizes that the power has been shut off as well. He runs to the door, but it is locked. He peeks through the door and sees a group of men, holding fluorescent bulbs, staring out at him. They are angry and scared, and their faces are covered by the bulbs. He realizes that they have no idea what is going on, and they are afraid of the unknown. He sees the Captain and the other crew members looking at him with fear. The Captain tells them to shut the ship down and shuts off all the engines, and everyone else is told to stay inside. The crew is told that the Captain has ordered them to stay away from the ship because there is an enemy fleet on the other side of the planet, and if they are detected, they will be shot down. Captain Miethlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, talks while his hands manipulate a panel of studs in a control room while the pilot sits in a bucket seat. The pilot, his back encased in leather, listens to earphones, and turns a serious, squared face towards Shano. He says that Shano already knew that this was his last ride. He wants to return to Pluto because he was there once before, and now he is going home. He thinks about the uranium mining on Pluto, but his lungs are fighting gas, so he decides to stay. He writes his signature on the waiver and leaves the ship and goes back to Pluto.",
    "Rourke is the captain of the ship that Shano is traveling on. He is described as a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad-shouldered, huge, huge and crustacean-like. His mustaches are two spears on each side of his squared nose, and his face features a queer nick in his jawbone. He has a purple band on the breast of his tunic with the name \"Rourke\" on it. His jaw is also notched with a knife, and he wears a tunic that is embroidered with \"Stardust\" on the back. Shano describes him as a sullen, chunky man who refuses Shano's ticket to the ship because the captain says he is entitled to know of the danger ahead. When Shano arrives at Cradle Six, he is greeted by a loud speaker that announces the arrival of the liner Stardust, now arriving from Venus. Captain Menthlo talks to Shano while his hands manipulate a panel of studs in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sits in a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones. Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard, the captain talks to the pilot and at last turns a serious, squared face towards Shano. He tells Shano that there is a Uranian fleet out there, and they had a skirmish with one, and got away. The captain seems for the first time to realize the social status of Shano and he becomes a little gruff. Want you to sign this waiver, saying you\u2019re traveling at your own risk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible. In a few hours we can\u2019t bother with a passenger. In the meantime, we will shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device onboard, to try to avoid detection. His face changes to an alert watchfulness. The lieutenant punches his ticket, and Shano steps into the air lock. The pumps stop, the lights go out, and the ship\u2019s acceleration increases. He hears oxygen hiss through the pipe, and then flow soundlessly into his lungs. The cabin is like a mine shaft, dark and cold. He peeks out the door. Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men, glimmered by Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. He sees officers and men, their faces tight with fear. He tries to go home, but the captain tells him to stay on the ship. The ship is taking off in thirty minutes. The loud speaker blares \u201cstardust, take off in 30 seconds.\u201d Shano hears the words \u201cdanger out there\u201d in his ears. Stardust takes off, taking off with the words of the captain. He feels the pressure of acceleration increasing, increasing, and hurriedly exits his cabin. The airlocks close, and a series of locks close behind him. He enters the hull, through two more locks, closing each behind them. He inhales oxygen through the pipes, and hears the sound of his lungs fighting gas. He thinks of Pluto, and thinks of his gum-clogged lungs. He smokes and thinks about the things he has heard about nicked jaws. He knows things about them Uranian devils, heard them in the mines around. Hearthings, a laborer does. He realizes that the captain has evaded him, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. He goes back to his cabin, and waits for the alarms to go off. When they do, the airlocks shut off, he hears the air flow out. He coughs, and realizes that his lungs are fighting the gas. When the ship is in danger, he runs out of oxygen. He runs to the airlock, and when it closes, he inhales again.",
    "Shano\u2019s occupation and actions in the story reveal that he is an Earthman who has been on Earth for a long time. He has been to Pluto, Mars, and other planets, and has heard about the dangers of the Uranian devils. He is a laborer by trade, but he has also heard about them in the mines around the planet. Shano is a bit of a daredevil as well, as he is the only person on the ship who has seen and heard about nicked jaws. He does not want to go back to Earth, but the captain tells him that he has no choice, as the ship is taking off in thirty minutes, and there is a danger out there. He wants to go home, so he signs a waiver that says he is traveling at his own risk, and the captain orders him to stay in his cabin as much as possible. When the ship takes off, Shano feels the pressure of acceleration rapidly increasing, increasing, and he rushes into the control room to see the captain. The captain is a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad-shouldered, huge, yetcrushable as a beetle, talking while his hands manipulate a panel of studs in a control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sits in a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones. Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard, the captain says that a passenger named Shano has landed on the planet, and Shano already knew this is his last ride. He tries to convince the lieutenant, who refuses the ticket, that he should go home. The lieutenant punches his ticket, it's your funeral, old man. The loud speaker blares: Stardust, take off in 30 seconds. Stardust is arriving from Venus, now arriving from the spaceport of the planet Mercury, and all passengers for Venus and Earth are to board in ten minutes. The ship's captain seems to realize the social status of Shano, and becomes a little gruff. Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own risk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as well as possible, when the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few hours we will shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device aboard to try to avoid detection. His mustaches rise like two spears from each side of his squared nose as his face changes to an alert watchfulness. Going home, eh? Shano scrawled his signature on the waiver. Pluto, from the sound of that cough. He coughed and thought of the uranium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing desire for home overwhelmed him. He goes through the turnstile to board the ship, and when it clicks, he sees the gleaming belly of twenty-one sinking into the Spaceport cone of light. He grabs his ticket to the lieutenant standing alone at the air lock. He waits for the captain to arrive, and then goes to the next deck. The man turns and grabs Shano's thin arm, tapping a cigarette, and tells him to light a lighter. The other passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously; Shano sees that the passenger line has dissolved. He moves, shuffling, to the gate, thrusts his ticket in the scanner slot, and pushes through a turnstil, and sees the ship arrive from Venus. He sees the captain and the lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The next deck is bathed in infra red, and a detached triple row of bright specks - portholes of the liner Stardust - come down. There is no eagerness in his heart, only a relief. A relief. He thinks of Pluto. A life of digging, lifting, lugging, lugging, and pounding. As though on oiled pistons, the ship sank into the light, its longshark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settles into the cradle's ribs. The passenger line quitters as a loud-speaker booms - Stardust has arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust arrives from Venus and is about to board. He coughs, and wipes phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following around the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard stubble and loose skin of his neck. He realizes that Pluto is his home. He knows things about them Uranians. Heard them in mines around. Hearsthings, a labor gangs of Uranus.",
    "The ship that Shano is on is called Stardust, Cradle Six, and it is arriving from Venus from the planet of Mercury. The ship is equipped with a number of different types of equipment, such as a turnstile, a radio, a viewport, and an air lock. It is also equipped with an emergency oxygen tank, which allows Shano to stay on the ship for a short amount of time in case of emergency. There is also a control room, where the captain, pilot, and Shano are all located. The control room has a series of switches that control the ship\u2019s machinery, including the radio, the air lock, and the autopilot. Shano also has a bunk bed, which he uses to restock his oxygen tank. The air lock is located on the outside of the ship, and there is an emergency button that can be pressed to shut off the ship. There are also a set of stairs that lead to the control room. The controls are controlled by a switch on the inside of the cabin, which has a button that turns off the airlock.",
    "The story takes place on the planet Pluto. Shano\u2019s ship, Stardust, has landed at the spaceport of the planet Mercury. The ship is arriving from Venus and is on its way to Earth. The spaceport is bathed in infra red light, and there is a triple row of bright specks that look like a triple-porthole-shaped ship with portholes. There is a passenger line at the gate, and Shano is waiting to board the ship. The captain, Captain Menthlo, talks while his hands manipulate a panel in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sits in a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones. Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard, the captain talks to the pilot and at last turns a serious, squared face to Shano. The lieutenant, a sullen, chunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refuses the ticket. The loud-speaker blares \u201cStardust, taking off in thirty seconds.\u201d Shano steps into the air lock, followed by the officer, and the lock closes. The outside is shut off, and they enter the ship through a series of two more locks, closing each one behind them. The cabin is like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pound on the deck outside, and he peeks out the door. Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men, glint in the hands of men. He peeks in through the door, and sees the officers and men, their faces tight, staring at him. He sees the captain and the pilot talking, and hears the words \u201cdead silence\u201d and \u201can enemy fleet is out there\u201d being broadcasted. The airlocks stop, the pumps stopped, the lights go out, Shano hears oxygen flow through the pipes, and his lungs fill with oxygen. He hears the captain talking again, and tells Shano to stay in the cabin. He feels the pressure of acceleration rapidly increasing, and rushes in. He enters the ship, and is met by the captain, who tells him that the ship has taken off. He tells him to stay on the ship as much as possible, and shuts down all mechanical devices. The passengers are told that they will be shut down in a few hours, and every mechanical device is to be removed from the ship in an effort to avoid detection. When Shano wakes up in his cabin, the ship is in orbit above the planet, and a red signal is blaring, alerting the passengers that there is an enemy fleet out there, and that they should ground themselves or travel at their own risk. He sits on the bunk, lighting a cigarette and smoking, and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement of his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other. What were the things he had heard about nicked jaws? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits. Secretives discussing in the saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of Uranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn\u2019t know. But he knew there was arumor and that it was the talk of ignorant men. When the captain had evaded it, he moved, shuffling, to the gate and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked. When it clicked, the passengers were on their way to the ship and the ship was landing. The man turned and grabbed Shano, tapping a cigarette. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed to be notched with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of his tunic was a purple band, with the name \u201cRourke\u201d on the breast. The word \u201cstardust\u201d was also written on the back. He saw the captain speaking to the next deck, and saw the crew of the ship talking to him.",
    "Marsh Marsh wakes up in his father\u2019s temporary apartment, thinking about his upcoming trip to the space station. He thinks back to his childhood, when mice and monkeys were sent up in Vikings to launch into space, and the first satellites were launched. 10 As he watches teardrop cars whip by Phoenix, Arizona, he thinks back over the years to the years that humans have been exploring space beyond Earth. 11 His parents are up ahead of time too, trying to act as though it are just another day. His father is pretending to enjoy his morning paper, nodding onlycasually to Marsh as he comes in. His mother is stirring eggs in the skillet, and his father is reading the paper in the kitchen. The three of them sit down at the table, still speaking in monosyllables and of unimportant things, but Marsh can hear the footsteps of worried people. The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when he had first signed up for space-cadet training. When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first to the psychiatrist who checked his condition. In the adjoining room, he could hear the footstep of his mother and father, and he knew that they were worried about him more than his own uneasiness. He went on to see the space surgeon, who assured him that he was in perfect condition, and then to the rocket experimental center, where he would be briefed on everything that he would encounter during the flight. He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When an officer wakes him, he rises from the cot he had been lying on in a private room of General Forsythe, Chief of Space Operations. He goes out to the kitchen, where his parents are already up, and Marsh jumps out. When he sees his father, he sees that he is nervous, but his father assures him that it is all part of the plan. Later, as Dad drives Marsh to the field, each scene along the way seems to take on a new look for Marsh. It is an uncomfortable feeling, almost as if he were seeing the sethings for the last as well as the first time. Finally the airport comes into view. The guards at the gate recognize Marsh and ushered the car through ahead of other people. Some eager news photographer snaps up close and shoots off flash bulbs in Marsh's eyes. Marsh goes on to the air force's experimental center where he will be briefed about everything he will encounter during his flight. The third stage of the rocket will carry Marsh into a perpetual orbit around Earth, along the route that a permanent space station is to be built after the results of the flight are studied. After spending a little while in this orbit, Marsh will begin the precarious journey back to Earth, in gliding flight. When Marsh wakes back, he gets a call from his father. He gets up, showered, pulls on his blue-corded cadet uniform, and pulls on the polished gray boots. He takes one final look around his room as though infarewell, then goes out for the blast-off. He sees his parents, who are up before him, and sees him once more before the blast off. He hears his father's mouth quiver as he leaves. Marsh sees his mother's mouth tremble as she talks about how he will not be able to leave the house. He tells his father that he will see him later, and their good-byes. When his father leaves, Marsh climbs back into bed, but sleep does not come. When the alarm rings, he wakes early, before the alarm sounds, and gets up. He wakes early again. He shows his blue corded uniform, shows off his gray boots, and wakes up.",
    "Marsh\u2019s emotions change throughout the story as he goes through the various stages of his training. Initially, he is nervous and anxious about being selected to be the first man to go into space. He is anxious about the unknown, the unknown unknowns, and the unknown dangers of the journey. However, as the training goes on, he begins to feel more and more comfortable with his job. He begins to enjoy the company of his fellow cadets, and he starts to believe that he will be able to take care of his family. As the training continues, Marsh begins to see things that he has never seen before. He starts to feel a mix of excitement and fear. At first, he feels a mixture of both emotions: excitement and apprehension. At the beginning of the story, Marsh is overwhelmed with excitement and nervousness about being chosen to be one of the first to go to space. Later, however, as he gets closer and closer to the end of the training, his emotions begin to settle down. He feels a sense of relief and relief when he realizes that he is going to make it safely back to Earth.",
    "Marsh\u2019s parents are nervous and anxious about him going into space. They are worried about him because he is the first in their family to go into space, and they want him to succeed. His friends want to wish him luck and wish him good luck as well, but his parents are anxious because they are worried that he will not be able to make it out alive. His father is nervous because he has never been in space before, and his mother is anxious because she is worried that her husband will not make it back from the trip alive. Marsh is also anxious because he will be the first person to go to space. He is also nervous because his parents will be watching over him while he is in space. All of the characters in the story are nervous about the first flight because they have never been to space before. The space engineers have made sure that every bug has been ironed out before risking a man's life. Marsh's friends are nervous because they know that the rocket which Marsh is going up in is as safe as their auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it, Marsh? The Colonel and the Chief of Space Operations are both worried about Marsh's safety, and the cadet's parents are worried because they don't know if he will make it safely out of the blast-off.",
    "The story takes place in the United States. The first part of the story is set in Marsh\u2019s childhood home in Phoenix, Arizona, where he lives with his parents, mother, and father. It is a small, commercial field that has been taken over by the Air Force in recent years and converted into the largest rocket experimental center. The space engineers have made sure that every bug has been ironed out before risking the life of the space cadet, Marsh. The air is cool and clear in the desert night, and there is no sun in the sky. The story then moves to the future, when Marsh is selected to be the first man to go into space on a rocket. The rocket is made up of three stages, and the first two parts are jettisoned after reaching their peak velocities. The third stage will carry Marsh into a perpetual orbit around Earth, along the route that a permanent space station will be built after the results of the flight are studied.

He goes on to the laboratory to be briefed on everything he will encounter during the flight. The room is small and cramped, and it is where Marsh will be given his first exhaustive tests and briefings. Later, as he drives to the field, each scene seems to take on a new look for Marsh. He sees things that he has never noticed before, such as the new look of the airport and the guards at the gate. The car passes through the gate, and some eager news photographer shoots off flashbulbs in his eyes. Marsh sees the small upper third section of a three-stage rocket that will take him into space. He will occupy the smallupper third of the rocket, and when the rocket reaches its peak velocity, it will carry him into a perforated orbit. Marsh will spend a little time in the orbit, and after a while, he will return to Earth.",

The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when he had first signed up for space-cadet training. They had known there was an extremely high percentage of washouts, and after each test he passed, they had pretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly they had hoped he would fail, for they were aware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists were working for\u2014the goal that had just now been reached.

He sees a young woman named Mary Alice Pope, a slim, sweet, patrician-looking young woman, who is sitting at a table with three other people. She tells him that she was out sailing and landed on the far side of the cove and didn\u2019t realize that no one ever comes to this place. She explains that she\u2019s visiting the area to do research on the sea life patterns of the in-shore islands under the direction of Professor Kesserich, who has been dead for twenty years.

There, he sees an old man, who he recognizes from old pictures, sitting in an old-fashioned, square-lined touring car. He introduces himself as Jack Barry and asks her out for a drink, but she refuses. He explains that he is doing research in marine ecology, which is sort of sea-life patterns on the inshore islands, and that he has been hired by the professor to help with the research. The woman says that she has never met him before, and she is staying with him. Jack explains that the old man has been away to Europe on some conferences, but he will be back in a couple of days.

    "The story takes place on an unnamed island in the ocean off the coast of Maine. It is described as quiet as the face of an expectant child, filled with tall trees and tall grass. There is a narrow, quiet cove with a narrow road leading to a rocky spine that leads to another island. The road goes down to the wharf, and up to the top of the island, where the man\u2019s aunts have a tree-house. There are trees, grass, and tall, heavy shrubbery along the edge of the road, and there is an eight-foot fence topped with barbed wire topped with heavy mesh. The man runs up a short grassy slope, runs through a fringe of trees, and comes up against a barbed-wire fence. He jumps for a branch of an oak whose trunk touches the fence, scorching the lower branch on the other side of the tree. Then he draws himself up, works his way to some higher branches that crossed the fence and drops down inside. Suddenly, a closely mown lawn dotted with shrubs runs up to a snug white Cape Cod cottage. The single strand of a radio aerial stretches the length of the roof. Parked on a neat gravel driveway is a short, square-lined touring car that is remembered from old pictures as an ancient Essex. Then, with the air of a clock-work toy coming to life, an elderly woman opens the door of the house and a slim girl emerges, dressed in a long, lace-edged dress and wide, lacy hat. She climbs into the driver's seat of the car. The car begins to chugbravely, gravel skitters, and the car rolls off between the trees. The door closes again and the door opens again. The girl gets into the car and the motor begins to move. The two go to the furthest point of the beach, where she sits in the passenger seat. The story ends with the car moving again.",

The man is a member of one of the Brothers, and the man next to him, a middle-aged man, is inquiring about Michael\u2019s membership in the Angeleno Brotherhood. The other man is named Pierce B. Carpenter, and he is a salesman for Aphrodisiacs, a line that sells its products to Earthmen. The story then moves to the future, where the young man has left the Lodge and is on a 40 credit tour of the outer world. He has spent months studying the customs and tabus of the United Universe, and is confident that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself. He is told by Carpenter that he cannot enter his novitiate until he has achieved his majority, so he should spend some time outside and see how he likes it. He puts on a pair of yellow gloves and sits in a chair next to the woman, who is in need of mental therapy. A disembodied pair of hands administer a spoonful of Grugis juice to her, and her hair turns bright yellow, makeup blooms on her face, and she quickly becomes a Callistanclog. The stranger, Carpenter, introduces himself as Mr. Carpenters, and tells Michael that he has eight fingers on each hand, and two fingernails on each, all covered with green scales. He also tells him that eight fingers make him inferior to him because he has sixteen fingers, and that he does not want to be called a lesser Universal because he is an Earth tabu. Carpenter tells him to put on the gloves, and Michael agrees. The two go to the storeroom, where a salesman offers him some Plummy Fruitcake from Vega. The quality is high, but the price is meager. The salesman pats Michael on the shoulder and says that he is staying a while in Portyork until he learns the ways of the Lodge. He tells Michael to stick close to him for a while until he becomes a fully fledged Brother because he can\u2019t run around loose by himself until he acquires civilized behavior patterns. Then, he will be free to explore the outside world. Michael decides to put the gloves on and goes outside. He sees a baby protruding its fat face at him three-dimensionally, but he cannot shut out its lisping voice. Carpenter warns him to be careful, because he might be reported for violating the tabu's rules. The young man is told that he will not be reported because Earthmen are not allowed to violate their tabus. He goes outside and meets a man named Carpenter, who tells him about his business, and then they go to see a baby. The baby is named Callistan Clog, and it has green scales on its face and is covered in green dust. They go to a store and buy Callistan clogs. They return to the lodge, where Carpenter tells them that they cannot go outside because it is forbidden on Earth because it would violate the spirit offree enterprise. He explains to them that turning it off would violate their way of life, and they would not want that, so they go back to their old ways. They get into a car and head outside. They stop at a gas station and buy a gallon of water. They head to a restaurant, where they sit down to eat. The waiter informs them that the drink is made with Mealy Mush from Nunki, which is made from the planet Dschubba. They eat and talk to the waiter.",
    "Each of the planets in the United Universe have their own customs and tabus, which are different from those of the other planets.

On Earth, people have eight fingers on each hand, and their fingernails are covered with green scales, which makes them inferior to those on other planets because they do not have the same amount of green scales. The same is true for Earthmen as well, who have sixteen fingers on their hands compared to eight on Earthmen who have two. The rules are also different for each planet, and there is no war in the whole of the universe. The only crime is injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed, and the only way to get out of it is to become a member of one of the Brotherhoods.",
    "The story is set in the future where humans have left Earth and are living in the outer world. The story begins with a young man named Michael Frey sitting next to a man named Pierce B. Carpenter on a shelf in a storeroom. They are both members of the Angeleno Brotherhood, a group of people who have been there for a long time. They have eight fingers on each hand, two fingernails on each, and are covered with green scales. The other man is a middle-aged man named Paul Carpenter, and he is selling Grugis juice to a woman named Haggard, who is in need of mental therapy. The storeroom has an illuminated panel that fills the forward end of the shelf on which the young man is lying. The picture on the panel is of a haggard blonde woman sprawled in a chair. A disembodied pair of hands administers a spoonful of Grugi juice to the woman, and her hair turns bright yellow, makeup blooms on her face, her clothes get shorter, and she bursts into a fast Callistanclog. The man next to Michael is a fellow member of the Brotherhood, who tells him that he has been a member since he was an infant. He hands him a card with the photograph of Mr. Carpenters suspended inside, along with his registration number, his name, his address, and the Universal seal of approval. He also tells him to put some gloves on, and a pair of yellow gauntlets slide out of his pack. The two leave the storeroom and walk down a dimly-lit street, where they pass a thrift store that sells Plummy Fruitcake from Vega. The quality is high, but the price is meager. The salesman pats Michael\u2019s shoulder and says that he is staying a while in Portyork until he learns the customs and tabus of the other planets. He tells Michael that he can\u2019t run around loose by himself until he has acquired civilized behavior patterns, or he will get in trouble. He goes to the back of the store, where he finds a place to sit. There is a large room with a table and chairs, and there is a windowless room where he can see the outside world from the window. He sits down on a bench and looks out at the city, which is covered in lush greenery. There are trees and greenery, and it is very hot in the city. The air is heavy with the smell of fresh-cut grass and leaves. He notices that the sky is gray and rainy, which makes him realize that it is time for him to leave the Lodge and go back to Earth.",
    "The trip from Earth to the outer world is significant because it is the first time that Michael has left the Lodge, a society where he has been a member since he was an infant. This means that he has spent a lot of time studying the customs and tabus of the other planets in order to prepare himself for the new life that he will be leaving behind. The Lodges are a system of universal kinship, where all of the planets are the same, and there is no war in the United Universe. The only crime is injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed, and the telepaths are still trying to add thought to the statute of the statute. Therefore, Michael had questioned the Father Superior about the reason for the Lodge\u2019s existence, any reason for a group of humans to retire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive ancestors. When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had, perhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the world. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? The Father Superior had smiled. You cannot enter your novitiate until you\u2019ve achieved your majority, and you won\u2019t be thirty for another five years. Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying the ways of Earth, because he had been so sure he would know its ways instinctively. He had skimmed over Earth. Remembering his preparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence. He presses the button marked \u201cGloves A\u201d on his pack, and a pair of yellow gloves slide out. He puts them on, and they harmonize with his scarlet tunic and turquoise breeches. The quality of the quality is meager, but the price is meager. The salesman pats him on the shoulder and tells him that he is staying a while in Portyork. Then, he tells him to stick close to him for a while until he learns their ways. He is not yet a fully fledged Brother, so he cannot enter the Lodge until he has achieved his majority. He cannot enter until he is thirty, and he wants to spend some time outside and see how he likes it. The trip back to Earth is significant for the whole story because it marks the beginning of his departure from the Lodge.",
    "Mr. Carpenter is a middle-aged man with blue eyes and dust-brown hair. He is a member of the Angeleno Brotherhood. He has eight fingers on each hand, and two fingernails on each, all covered with green scales. He tells Michael that eight fingers does not make him inferior to him because he has sixteen fingers. He also tells him that it is forbidden for anyone to appear in public with his hands bare on Earth because it is automatically prohibited on Earth. Mr. Carpenter asks Michael if there is any way of turning that thing off, to which he replies that turning it off would violate the spirit offree enterprise. He then tells him to put on the yellow gloves that he has in his pack because yellow is the color of death on Saturn, and no one ever wears yellow on the planet. The button marked \"Gruis B\" unlocks a pair of rose-colored gloves that harmonize ill with his scarlet tunic and turquoise breeches. The quality's high, sang a quartet of beautiful female humanoids, but the price is meager. He decides to buy Plummy Fruitcake from Vega. The salesman pats Michael's shoulder and says that he is staying a while in Portyork until he learns the ways of the Lodge. He warns Michael that he can't run around loose by himself until he has acquired civilized behavior patterns. Michael agrees, but he also knows that he cannot leave the Lodge until he reaches his majority, which is five years from now. The Father Superior has smiled because he is not yet a fully fledged Brother, and he cannot enter his novitiate until he is at the age of thirty. Michael had agreed to spend some time outside and see how he likes it, but before leaving, he had spent months studying the way of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because he was sure that he knew its ways instinctively. He was astonished by his smug self-confidence, and his fellow traveller, Carpenter, is horrified when he sees him. Carpenter blushes and looks away when Michael reveals that his hands are perfectly good hands, and that there is nothing wrong with them. The other man smiles, and Michael agrees that turning the machine off would be a violation of the spirit of universal behavior. Carpenter tells him he will put the gloves on as soon as he has time to think about it. He hands Michael a transparent tab with the photograph of Mr. Carpentersuspended inside, together with his registration number, his name, his address, and the Universal seal of approval. When he leaves the Lodge, he will become a full-fledged Brother.",
    "The story begins with a man, Eric North, looking at the city of Mars from the bottom of the canal. He is a native of Earth, the Third Planet of Sol, and he has never been there before. He sees the city and its grandeur from the top of the canals, but he cannot bring himself to enter it because of the fear that he will lose his body and become a husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those who came before him. He hears the sound of the city\u2019s music and runs towards it, but it is not enough for him to enter the city. The city is evil, an evil like time coursed through his frame. He grabs the copper hat from his head and beats on the lotus carving of the great door, crying, \u201cPlease, take me back into the city!\u201d The city changes, and it is dull and sordid and evil, acity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and minarets are gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the city is a macabre song of hate. He fights the lids of his eyes, fought to close them while he stares at the jeweled towers, and borne on the thin winds the thinwail of music reaches him, saying, Come into the fabled city, come down. He slides over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the water, tearing at his dungarees. His feet catch a projecting bit of stone and are slowed for an instant, so that he turns sideways and rolls on, down into the reddust bottom of a canal, to lie face down in the dust. He tells himself, I am Eric North from Earth, and this is not real, so get away from the city before you lose it all. He turns and stumbled back to the great gate and hammers on it until his fists are raw, pleading for it to open and let him back. And deep inside, some part of his mind says, This is a madness you cannot escape, so he must go down there. He stands, amazed, and puts the metal hat back on his head; the shift takes place again, and beauty is beautiful again. When he reaches the bottom, he realizes that the metal has not entirely failed him after all. The wind freshened and the tune of the music begins to talk to him, telling of going barefoot over long streets of fur, and women as fair as springtime. He stops to rest, and slowly his head begins to turn. He realizes that he is beyond the range of the illusions, and when he does, he begins to run towards the city again. He runs down the dusty floor of thecanal, and up the rocky sides until he stands on the Martian desert. He breathes easily then, and now that his mind is his own again, begins to understand something of the nature of the forces against which he had been pitted. The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield against electrical waves tuned to affect his brain, but the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised pattern as he approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense against illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenlyto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, andthe machine caught up only after he glimpsed another image. Then he replaced the helmet, and grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the people he saw, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they were as ugly as the city had been. Yet the danger was too great. He will go back to his ship and make the arrangements to destroy the city with his brother Garve. The ship was armed, and to deliver direct fire over the over-the-edge canal would be simple enough. GarveNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. After they blast whatever it is that lay in the canal floor, then it would be time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what is left. He opens the door and enters. The lock doors are left open so that Eric can enter directly. He beats against the gate and cries, and cries again. The music is richer now, as if it were everywhere. The gate swings open without the faintest sound. A sentinel stands before the opened gate at the end of a long bluestreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blueleopard skin. He draws a belt with a jeweled short sword. He bows forward until the point of the sword touched the street of blue fur. He says, I give you the welcome of his sword.",

However, the city is evil, and it frightens him, so he runs away from the city. When he returns to the city, the people are angry at him, and they are calling for him to be scourged. He tries to run away from them, but the city\u2019s guards stop him. They are angry because they think that he is a foreigner, and want to kill him. Eric is angry because he is from Earth and wants to go back to his home planet. The citizens of Mars are scared of him and want nothing to do with him. He does not want to be a part of this city, but his mind keeps telling him that he must go back. He knows that if he goes back, he will never be able to leave the city again, and his body will become a husk, a soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those who came before him.",

The spires and minarets are gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound of the city is a macabre song of hate. The city is filled with jewels, and wine, and women as fair as springtime. There is a high wall around it, and a heavy gate carved with lotus blossoms. The gates close behind him, and he runs towards the city. When he reaches the city, he runs down the red sandstone floor of the canal, and enters the gate. He beats against the gate and cries out for the city to let him in. The music is richer now, as the gate swings open without the faintest sound. A sentinel stands before the opened gate at the end of a long bluestreet. He is dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blueleopard skin, and wears a belt with a jeweled short sword. He draws his sword from its scabbard and bows forward until the point of the sword touches the street of blue fur. He says, I give you the welcome of my sword, and I welcome you to the city; speak your name so that it may be set in the records of the dreamers. He tells Eric North, from Earth, the third planet of Sol, that this is not real. He runs away from the city and climbs down the sloping sides of the canals to reach the bottom of them.

He stands, amazed, and puts the metal hat back on his head; the shift takes place again, and beauty is beautiful again. He turns and looks behind to be sure that he is safe. The towers twinkle at him; music whispers to him, Come back, Eric North.

The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him; it told of going barefoot over long streets of fur, and told of jewels and wine. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head began to turn; the spires twinkled at him, beautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that welled down his cheeks. He reaches the top of the hill and looks at the city from the top. The water is red and smells of dust, and there are huge towers and jewels and women waiting for him to claim them. He takes off his hat and runs towards them. The sound of music is less than human; his feet caught a projecting piece of stone, slowed for a moment, so he turns around and rolls sideways and falls down the hill. He lies face down on the red dust floor. The metal hat cuts into his chin. He hears the music again. His face is turned toward the towers and the thin winds. He sees jewels and twinkling towers.

Rat was attached to the watch, but he left his post and is now AWOL. He has been hanging around all the fields and dumps on Mars, finally landing on Earth. He is a freaks from Centauria somewhere, and he has landed on this planet because he is afraid of Mr. Roberds\u2019 job. He refuses to risk it, and the others want him to pilot the ship to Earth because they are afraid of him. The story then moves to a hospital, where a young nurse, Gray, tells the story of how she overheard the conversation between Rat and the Consul about the sick woman and how she favors him. She also tells them about the events of the Sansan massacre, and how Rat had no part in it. She tells them that Rat was in an important office on Mars when the attack took place, and that he was assigned to watch over the outpost.

The nurse explains to her that the ship is on its way to Earth, and Mr. Robertds is the one who put Rat on the ship in the first place. When the ship arrives, the two go to the office building, where they find the ship's commander, Peterson, sitting in a chair. They inform him that Rat is the missing pilot, and tell him that he will not be able to fly the ship because he has no piloting experience. They decide to take him to Earth. When they get there, they find him in a small room with a gun pointed at him. They take him out of the room, where he is being held by a Centurian named Mr. Robertson, and take him back to the ship.

She then tells them about the events of the night before, when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the Ganymedean colony, and there was no warning. Rat was attached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch. He was AWOL, and no warning was given. He had been hanging around all the fields and dumps on Mars for a long time, and finally landed on this planet. He is a freaks from Centauria somewhere, and has landed here. He has no connection to politics, so his disappearance saved his job. He leaves the ship and goes to bed, and Gray tells him that she will take care of him. The next morning, she wakes up in a hospital, where she sees that Rat is gone. She goes to wake him up, but he has disappeared again. She decides to take the ship back to Earth, so she goes back to sleep in the hammock. She wakes up again in the middle of the day, and realizes that the Captain and the others are gone. They are on their way to the ship, but she decides to go with them because she is sick. The Captain and his men are on a mission to find a ship that can take them to Earth and save their lives. She takes the ship with her, and Rat takes the place of the Captain. The story ends with the two of them in the hospital.",
    "The story begins with two colonists, Karl and Joe, on a journey through the forest of Midplanet. They are on a mission to find a wife for Karl\u2019s brother, Joe, who wants to raise a family with her on Earth. Karl is a Second System colonist and has never met a woman from Earth, so he has no idea what it is like to have a wife and children on Earth, but he is curious about what it will be like to marry an Earth woman. Joe is a tall, thick-bodied man who is used to living alone and who likes living alone, but once he takes a wife, he will probably have to keep himself in clean clothes and shave every few days. Karl, on the other hand, is a young man who wants a family and children, and he thinks about how he will raise those children. They leave the leafy expanse of the forest and enter the grassland towards Landing City, a smudge of rusting steel shacks, muddy streets, and the small rocket port. Karl looks out of the corner of his eye at Hill and feels a vague wave of uneasiness. Hill is a big, thick man wearing the soiled clothes and stubble of a man who has lived alone for a long time, and it is possible that the woman he takes with him on the mission will not like living with him. Karl thinks about what the women from Earth would be like, and Hill tells him that they will all have to work the farms and raise families. The path is getting crowded, more of the colonists coming onto themain path from the small side trails. Hill breaks the silence first, I wonder what they'll be like. Karl looked wise and nodded knowingly, they're Earth women, Joe. Karl takes the furs for his brother's wife, and they head into the thick forest. The battered shack that serves as rocket port office and headquarters for the colonial office on Midplanet loomed up in front of them. There is a crowd gathered outside of the building and they forced their way through to see what had caused it. They saw this the last time they were here, and Karl wants to take another look. It is a poster of a beautiful woman leaning toward the viewer. The edges of the poster are curling and the colors have faded during the last six months, but the girl's smile is still inviting as ever. She holds a long-stemmed goblet in one hand and blows a kiss to her audience. Her green eyes sparkle, and her smile is provocative. A quoted sentence reads: I'm from Earth! There is nothing more except a printed list of the different solar systems to which the colonist office is sending the women. She was real pretty, Karl thought. She is a little on the thin side, maybe, a dress she was wearing, but she has a certain something. Glamour, maybe? A loudspeaker blared. All colonists waiting for the wife draft assemble for your numbers!All colonists.... There was a jostling for places and then they were in the rapidly moving line. Grundy, fat and important-looking, was handing out littleblue slips with numbers on them. Karl drew the number 53 and hurried to the grassy lot beside the land. A table was loaded with governmentpamphlets meant to be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl went over and stuffed a few in his pockets. Other tables had been set out and were loaded with luncheon food, fixed by the few colonial women in the community. Karl caught himself eyeing the women closely, wonderinghow the girls from Earth will compare with them. He fingered the ticket in his pocket. He imagined what they would look like.",

There is a crowd gathered in front of the building, and they forced their way through to see what had caused it. They saw this the last time they were here, and Karl wants to take another look. He was anxious to glean all the information that he could from a poster of a beautiful woman leaning toward the viewer. The woman in the poster is from Earth, and the words \u201cI\u2019m from Earth!\u201d are printed on her poster, but there is nothing more except a printed list of the different solar systems to which the colonizers are sending the women. Karl thinks that the woman from Earth is real pretty, but she is a little on the thin side, maybe, and her dress is not practical. She is wearing a dress that would hardly be practical on the planet, and she has a certain amount of Glamour, maybe. A loudspeaker blared, all colonists waiting for the wife draft assemble for your numbers. All colonists are in the rapidly moving line.

Karl caught himself eyeing the women closely, wondering how the women from Earth would compare with them. He fingered the ticket in his pocket, thinking over something that had just occurred to him. He pondered the idea of a wife and children. He imagined that they would all have to work the farms and raise families. Karl laughed and aimed a friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddlingup and headed into the thick forest. Karl guided his mount along the dimly marked trail, and he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would be making. It would be nice to have somebody new to talk to, and it would be good to have someone to help with the trapping and tanning, some people who could tend the small vegetable garden at the rear of his shack and mend his socks and wash his clothes and cook his meals. And it was time, he thought soberly, that he started to raise a family. The path was getting crowded, more of the colonists coming onto themain path from the small side trails. He cinched his saddle and tied on some robes and furs behind it. Hill watched him curiously. What are you taking the furs for? This isn\u2019t the trading rocket. I know. I thought that when we come back tonight, it might be cold and maybe she\u2019ll appreciate the coverings then. You never would have thought of it yourself, Hill grunted. If you ask me, the less you give them, they will expect you to spoil them, once you spoil them. Karl pointed out. He could have applied for a wife from some different planet. One\u2019s probably just as good as another. They will all be good workers, they say they\u2019re good workers. Karl nodded. Hill puffed and wheezed and took another hitch on the rope. They took a deep breath and hauled mightily on the raft rope. The raft bobbed nearer. For a moment the swift waters of the Karazoo threatened to tear it out of their grasp, and then it was beached, most of itsolidly, on the muddy bank. One end of it still lay in the gurgling, rushing waters. Karl estimated that even with the refusal of their yllumphs to helpbeach the raft, they still had a good two hours before the rocket put down at Landing City. Two hours, maybe a little more, he stated hastily when Hill looked more worried. Time enough to get to Landing City and put in for their numbers on the list. He turned back to the raft and untied the leather and horn saddles, and threw them over the backs of their reluctant mounts. They threaded their way back in ten hours.",
    "In the beginning of the story, Karl and Joe are on their way to Landing City, where they are waiting for their numbers to be drawn for the wife draft.

She is from Earth, and the words \u201cI\u2019m from Earth\u201d are printed on the back of the poster. The woman\u2019s face is curling and the colors have faded, but her smile stays the same.

    "The story takes place on the planet of Midplanet, in a time in the future where humans have colonized the planet. The story begins with two colonists, Karl and Joe, walking along a path in the forest. They are on their way to Landing City, which is a small city on a planet with a population of ten thousand people or more. The forest that they walk through is thick with greenery, and there are trees, shrubs, and grass. There is also a small town called Karazoo, where the colonists live. The town is home to many different planets, including Earth, where Karl has never seen a woman, and other planets such as Altair, where he has been raised. The setting of the story is in the early 20th century, when Karl was a young man. He and Joe are on a mission to find a wife and children for Joe, who is the head of the colonizing office on Midplanet. They leave the forest and enter a grassland towards the city, where they are greeted by a group of colonists. The women from Earth are being sent to different planets by the colonial office, and Karl thinks about how he would like to have a wife of his own. He also thinks about the children he would want to have with Joe, and how they would be able to raise them on their own planet without having to leave their home planet. They arrive at the town, where there is a rocket port and a small rocket port. There are also a lot of other buildings, such as the governor\u2019s office, the ship landing area, and the town hall. The buildings are decorated with bunting and huge welcomesigns for the new arrivals, and a table is loaded with governmentpamphlets meant to be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl goes over to the table and fills out a ticket for a woman from Earth to be his wife. The woman turns out to be a beautiful young woman named Joe. She is described as a little on the thin side, and her dress is not practical, but she has a certain something. Karl thinks of her as Glamour, but he doesn\u2019t think she will have the time to take care of the children. Karl draws the number 53 and hurried to the grassy lot beside the land, beside the grassland that is the home of the new colonists. There, he meets a few other colonists, including Leonard, who has the biggest farm on MidPlanet, and Jenkins, a man who specializes in catching and breaking inyllumphs. The two go to a nearby grove of trees, where a small group of yllumphs nibbles grass and watches them closely. Karl and Hill talk about the future of the colonists, and they decide to take the raft back to the ship. They return in ten hours, and when they get back, they will put in for their numbers on the list. The ship will be landing in a few days, so they have two hours before they have to be there. Karl talks to Joe about the possibility of a wife, and Joe tells him that they will get crossed off the list if they\u2019re late for the ship's landing, which makes Karl very nervous. They head back to their hut, and Hill tells Karl that he will take the furs for his wife to wear when they come back tonight. Karl realizes that Joe has told him to do it, but Hill reminds him that he never would have thought of it himself, so he decides to take them. They go to the rocket port, and it is a smudge of rusting, corrugated steel shacks, muddy streets, and barbed wire. The city itself is smoky and smoky. The land is filled with metal shacks and a smoky thirty acres or sofenced off with barbed-wire. The colonists are waiting for the wife draft. Karl looks out of the corner of his eye at Hill and feels a vague wave of uneasiness. He thinks of his wife and thinks of how she might object to Hill letting him share the hut. He cinches his saddle and ties on some robes and furs behind it. The path is getting crowded, more of the other colonists coming onto themain path from the small side trails.

    "Escher and MacDonald\u2019s meeting in the story leads Escher and Karl to the grassy lot beside the land of Landing City, decorated with bunting and huge welcomesigns for the new arrivals. A table is loaded with government pamphlets meant to be helpful to newly married colonists. The pamphlets include information about the different solar systems to which the colonial office is sending the women. There is nothing more except a printed list of the planets to which they are going. Karl thinks about how the women from Earth are attractive, but he has never seen an Earthwoman. He thinks about what they will be like, and how they will expect him to do all the trapping, farming, and family-raising. He also thinks about the fact that they will all have to work the farms and raise families. The story ends with Karl and Joe on their way back to Landing City.",
    "The story begins with a group of colonists in the northland, deep in a great cave, surrounded by an ever-burning fire. They sleep by the fire, which is the resting time, the time of peace, and so shall it be for a thousand years. And yet we shall summon him again, my children, when we are sore in need, and out of the north he will come, and again and again, each time we call. Out of the dark and the cold, with the fire in his hands. He will come. \u2014 Scandinavian legend Throughout the night, thick clouds have been piling in the North; inthe morning, it is misty and cold. By eight o\u2019clock a wet, heavy, snow-smelling breeze has begun to set in, and because the crops are all down and the winter planting done, the colonists brewed hot coffee and remained inside. The wind blows steadily, icily from the north. It is well below freezing when, some time after nine, an army ship lands in a field near the settlement. There are some last brief moments in which the colonists can act and feel as they had always done. They wanted no soldiers here. The few who had convenient windows stared out with distaste and a mild curiosity, but no one went out to greet them. After a while, a rather tall, frail-looking man, standing on the ground looking toward the village, comes out. He remains there, waiting stiffly, his face turned from the wind. He is obviously not coming in, either out of pride or just plain orneriness, but a nice lady says that he is just standing there for, what\u2019s he waiting for? Another lady thinks that he must be drunk, and all of them think that he cannot be drunk because the seeds of peace are deeply planted in these people, in the children and in the women, very, very deep. The lone man keeps standing in the freezing wind, and the colonists have to get up out of a nice warm bed and go out to meet him. The soldier salutes, but he is not too neat and clean, and his salute is sloppy. There is a bomb at Lupus V too, and though it had not blown, the bomb is not blown. In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of earth, the wire had been dug up and cut. The army could not understand it and has no time to try. After five hundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army is small, weak, and without respect. Therefore, the army does nothing but spread the news, and Man begins to fall back. In a thickening, hastening stream, he comes back from the hard-won stars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of the colonists get out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died before the army ships can reach them. And the men in those ships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, are for a long while the only defense Earth had. Captain Dylan, the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth with a bottle on his hip. He tells the colonists that the war is huge and comes with great suddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait, between acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage. Dylan waits. The colonists are taking it well, much better than those in the cities, and they are pioneers. These people were taking it very well, but then, these were pioneers. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake it and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly and inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and impregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest. And setup automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee. Dylan grinned again. But at least this is better than the wailing of the cities. This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at allby any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an outcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing. He stirred restlessly. By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn\u2019t much to say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: Lupus, Lupus\u2014doesn't that mean wolves or something? Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers.",
    "The story takes place on the planet Lupus V. It is located in the northland, deep in a great cave, by an ever-burning fire. The cave is where the protagonist, Bob Rossel, sleeps. There is also a bomb buried in the center of the village, and there is a detonator in one of the main buildings. The ship that the colonists live on is hidden under twelve inches of earth, hidden from view by a wire hidden in the heart of the camp. The planet is cold and misty, and the wind blows from the north. The colonists live in plastic houses, which harden and become warm and impregnable. They have automatic factories that convert dirt into coffee. The land is fertile and clean, and they have a home out in the wilderness, hewed a home on the living rock, and become a pioneer. The first contact Man had ever had with an intelligent alien race occurs out on the perimeter in a small quiet place a long way from home. Late in the year 2360, an alienforce attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus v. The wreckage and the dead are found by the army. When the army comes it finds this: Of the seventy registered colonists, thirty-one are dead. The rest, including some women and children, are missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines, books, are also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were the bodies. Apparently, the aliens had a heat ray. Captain Dylan, the narrator of the story, is in charge of the colonists. He talks to Captain Dylan about the state of the colony, but the captain does not seem to understand what he is trying to tell him. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier finally stumbled on something. For security reasons, the ship had a bomb to be buried in each colony, because it was important to blow a whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn vital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb at Lupuses V too, and though it had not blown. The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly, and indicated that he had better read that and get moving. He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As Rossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but could not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch that, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongyclouds and the cold. The alien ship goes out of sight, and nobody ever sees it again.",
    "Captain Dylan is the captain of one of the colonies on the planet Lupus V. He is a tall, thin man with a gaunt, not too well shaven face. He sits on the edge of a table and listens to Captain Dylan\u2019s message from Fleet Headquarters. He has an obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt face and sits idly, one long booted leg swinging idly. His voice is low and does not carry. He waits patiently for the arrival of the army ship, which lands in a field near the settlement. When the army comes, he finds thirty-one of the seventy registered colonists dead. The rest, including some women and children, are missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines, books, are also missing. The buildings have been burned, so are the bodies.

He calls to Dylan, \u201cC\u2019n I go now, Jim.\u201d The young man calls back for him tonight, and then, grinning, tosses a bottle of liquor into his pocket. Rossel stares in disgust. A soldier is looking at him calmly, coldly, and suggests that he better read that and get moving. He turns and walks toward the buildings and Rossel has to follow. As Rossel draws near the walls, the watchers could see his lips moving but cannot hear him. Just then, the ship lifts, and they turn to watch that, and follow it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy clouds and the cold.",
    "The story begins with Jeff and Ann sitting at a restaurant in New York City. Jeff is upset because he has lost his lease on the building that he is going to start an engineering lab in. He wants to go back in time to a time where he could have bought it five years ago for two thousand dollars. Ann and Jeff are having dinner when a strange man at the next table invites them to go on a trip to another time. The man, who introduces himself as Mr. Snader, is an eccentric who makes trips all the time. He invites Jeff to go with him on a little trip to different time, where he will show them how his timetravel works. The two go to the next room in the building, where they are greeted by a fat man named Peter Powers. The next room is a waiting room with easy chairs along the walls. There is a sign hanging from the middle of the room that says \u201c4-D TRAVEL BEURO Greet Snader\u2019s bureau\u201d. There are two giant televisions that occupy a whole wall at either end of the large room. The sign bears the number 701 in bright yellow on black and an arrow pointing to the left with the word Ante and to the right with the words \u201cpost.\u201d Jeff notices the big screens moving through a long corridor that is lined with seats. When he turns to his right, a similar endless chair-lined corridor moves toward him from that direction. The room has a sign with \u201cAnte\u201d and \u201cPost\u201d on both sides of the screen. When Jeff turns to the middle, a man named Mr. Elliot greets him and invites him to his house. The house is a middle-sized, middle-cost home in an agood neighborhood. Jeff can hear the whisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away, and he can see the mountains on the horizon. All is peaceful. When they enter the house, the man unlocks the front door with a key that he draws from a finemetal chain around his neck. He leads them to a dimly-lit parlor with a sign that reads \u201cParlor of the Paranormal\u201d that hangs from the ceiling. Inside, there are two big screens that show two men talking on them. Jeff notices that they are from other time, and Mr. Elliott explains that he comes from the future, and that he wants to take Jeff back to that time. Jeff asks him to take him to a doctor, but the man says that he can\u2019t go back because he is sick. Jeff goes to see Ann, and she tells him that it is time to go to sleep. Ann tells Jeff that he needs to take more pills, and Jeff tells her that he does not need so many, but she reminds him that he has been taking pills lately. Ann asks Jeff if he is afraid of going back to the past, to which Jeff says that it would be a waste of money, and Ann says that they can go back. Jeff leaves the house and goes to the subway to get more pills. He goes back to his car, and when he gets to the station, he sees a man that reminds him of Mr. Snake-Oil Sam, the one who tried to kill him. He asks Ann to drive him to the hospital, and they go to his place. Jeff gets into a car with Mr. Sam, and the two get into a fight with him. They drive to the police station, where the police ask them to file a missing persons report. They get into an argument with the police. Jeff tells them that he cannot go back to 1952, and then they get into the car again. They go to Snader's house, and Snader tells them to take the car back to New York.",
    "The story takes place in the future, in a small, middle-class neighborhood in New York City. There are two main settings in the story: the first is the restaurant where Jeff meets Mr. Snader and his wife Ann, and the second is Mr. and Mrs. Elliot\u2019s home. The first setting is in the dining room of the restaurant, where Jeff and Ann eat. There is a sign hanging from the middle of the ceiling with the number 701 in bright yellow on black. The sign also has an arrow pointing to the left with the word Ante and to the right with the words Post. The second setting is the home of Mr. Elliot, a tall, handsome man that Jeff meets at the beginning of the story. The house is a middle-sized, middle cost home in an agood neighborhood. The windows have lights in the windows, and Jeff can hear the faint whisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. The man at the next table is a foreigner, and his suit has a silky sheen and bulges in his stubby, muscular torso. The story then moves to the next setting, which is a dimly-lit room with two giant television screens. The walls are lined with seats, and there is a chair-lined corridor leading to a door. The room has a sign that reads \u201cVIP\u201d on the left wall, and \u201cTRAVEL BEURO Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\u2019 on the right. The TV screens are situated at either end of the room, and at the far end is a door that leads to another room. The door has a spring lock, and it is locked when they go in. The next setting is a dark room with a sign advertising \u201cFREE TRIAL TALK\u201d and a card with a stiff plastic substance on it. The card also has a message that says \u201cTime Travel Beurs\u201d printed on both sides. The third setting is inside of a car with Jeff, Ann and Mr. Elliott in the back seat. The car is parked in the parking lot, and they get out of the car and walk into the building. The building is old and run down, but it is still a nice place to live.",
    "Time is significant in this story because it plays a significant role in the story. When Jeff meets Mr. Snader at the beginning of the story, he is in the process of applying for a new job with a new company. He is on the verge of losing his lease on the old company and wants to go back in time to get away from it. When he meets the man at the next table, he realizes that the man is following him and Ann. This makes Jeff very suspicious and he invites him to go on a trip to different time. When they get there, they find that time travel is not possible, so they go in search of a new place to go. They go to Snader\u2019s house, where he invites them to stay for free. The house is a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a suburban neighborhood. Jeff and Ann go inside, and the place is very quiet. There is a sign hanging from the middle of the room with the number 701 in bright yellow on black. The sign points to the left with Ante and to the right with the word Post. On each of the big screens, a picture is moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like a railroad club car. The picture seems to rush at them from the left wall, and from the right, a similar endless chair-lined corridor moves toward him from that direction. Time is significant because it is the only way that Jeff finds out what is happening in the future. When Ann and Jeff return to the present, they are greeted by a tall, handsome man named Mr. Elliot. He introduces himself as a local agent of the bureau and invites them on a free trial trip to another time. Jeff hesitantly agrees, and they go to the next room. The room is like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the walls. The only peculiar aspects are the giant televisions that hang from the ceiling and the TV screens that are occupied by a whole wall. The TV screens move through the room, and when Jeff looks at one of them, he notices that it is moving back and forth between the left and right side of the screen. The two go to another room, where there is a desk with a fat man named Peter Powers. The man smiles at them and tells them that he is there to help them. The next room has a door with a spring lock, and Jeff goes into the next one. The door is locked, but the man unlocks it with a key. Jeff goes to the third room, which is where he finds Mr. Elliott. He asks him to come with him, but he refuses. He goes back to the first room.",
    "Jeff and Ann have a very good relationship. They are married and have two kids together. Jeff is the smartest color engineer in television, and Ann is his right hand woman. Ann is very supportive of her husband, and she encourages him to take the trip to another time. Jeff has a lot of respect for her, and he appreciates her devotion to him. He also appreciates the fact that she is willing to go along with him on this trip, even if it means sacrificing some of her own money. When Jeff meets Mr. Snader, the man at the next table, he seems to be following Jeff and Ann around. Jeff thinks that the man is following them, but Ann says that he is just following them because Jeff missed a good chance five years ago to go back to the past and correct mistakes that he made. Ann also thinks that Jeff is losing his grip on reality, but Jeff says that it is silly because he is still the smartest person in television. When they go to Snader\u2019s house, they are greeted by a fat man named Peter Powers. He is a local agent of the bureau, and Jeff invites him to his house for a free trial trip. The next room is a waiting room with easy chairs along the walls, and there is a sign hanging from the middle of the room with the number 701 in bright yellow on the wall. There are two giant televisions in the ceiling, and they are occupied by a whole wall of them. The sign also has the words Ante on the left with the word Ante, and to the right with the words Post. Jeff studied the big screens moving through a long corridor, one after the other. The picture seems to rush at them from the left wall, and when he turns around, a similar endless chair-lined corridor moves toward him from that direction. When he goes to the next room, it is a small, middle-cost home. There is a desk in the hall, and a door that has a spring lock. The door is locked, and the man who unlocks it smiles at them. They go in, and Snader introduces himself as Mr. Elliot, a salesman from other time, and invites them to go on a trip with him. The room has a sign that reads \u201cVennox\u201d and \u201cAnte\u201d on both walls. The two go to the library, where they find a book that says \u201cThe Scarlet Book\u201d. The book tells the story of the Scarlet Raiders, a mysterious group of people who have gone back in time. The story ends with Jeff in a hospital, where he is being treated by a doctor.",
    "The relationship between the Elliotts and Mr. Snader is a tense one. Jeff and Ann are in love with each other, but they are not rich enough for expensive trips, so they do not go on them. Jeff is unhappy with the twelve grand he has to pay for the building he is trying to sell, and Ann does not want to spend money on a trip to different time. Jeff wants to go back in time, but Ann is not interested in that idea. Jeff does not like the idea of going back to the past, so he does not accept the invitation to go on the trip. He is angry with the fact that he has lost his lease on the building, and he wants to be able to build a better company in a new place. Ann is also angry with Jeff because she thinks he is losing his grip on reality, and she wants to know why he can't just go back to where he was five years ago, when he was in a better place. The relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Elliot is also tense, as they have not seen each other in a long time.",
    "Isobar Jones, better known as Isobar, is a meteorologist at the Experimental Dome on Luna. He has been working for six months beneath the impervite hemisphere of Lunar III, a frontier outpost that serves as a rocket refueling station, teleradio transmission point, meteorological base, and meteorological station. He and his colleagues at the Dome are responsible for forecasting the weather for each of the twenty-four solar systems of the solar system, including Earth, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter. He is annoyed with the fact that he is not allowed to play the bagpipe in his cubby, which Sparks, the Dome Commander\u2019s niece, suggests that he bring with him. He does not, however, as he is entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock, who wants to know about the weather in Oceania Sector 4B next week. Sparks is on the ether in four point sixteen minutes, so he promises him that he will be right up, and he ambles from his cell to deliver the sheets. He doesn\u2019t leave Sparks\u2019 turret after the sheets are delivered. He waits impatiently for the meteorological report to be delivered, and when it is, he returns to his duties. He notes the proper figures under the headings Sun Spots, Max Freq., and Min. Freq. on the Mercator projection of Earth, and then draws a clean sheet of paper with the results of his observations. He writes a report on the weather forecast for the week of May 15-21. The other radioman, O.Q., asks him to play a bagpipe, but he refuses as he has a swimming date at Waikiki with Miss Sally. The Dome Commander, Colonel Eagan, interrupts and tells him that Sparks is making Terra contact now. He tells him to send the report as soon as possible, and the two go to their respective cubbies. The next day, the Earth operator, Sparks, tells Isob that Earth is answering Luna's call, and that they will be able to communicate with each other in a few minutes. Sparks explains that he has to get the report rolling because Roberts and Brown have gone outside to make foundation repairs to the Dome, and they need to make contact with Terra. The two return to their cubbies, where they are interrupted by the voice of the Earth radio operator, who tells them that Earth has received a call from Luna, and Earth will be responding to their call in a couple of minutes. They return to the control room, where Iso barks at Sparks to stop playing the bagpipes. The Earth operator explains that they have to report to the D.C. and that it\u2019ll be swell all weekend, so they can go swimming. Sparks tells them to cut the jets, but they refuse as they have no idea what they are doing on Earth. They go to the command center, where the voice on the other end of the line tells them the weather is clear, and it is going to be sunny all weekend. They head to the O.C., where they meet the Dome commander, who informs them that the weather will be fine. They all go outside to swim in the sun, but the air is too toxic for them, so the men go back to their cells. The air on Earth is so toxic that they can no longer go outside. They have to stay in the Dome for the rest of their lives.",
    "The bagpipes are the source of the tension between Isobar and his colleagues at the Experimental Dome on Luna. They are the main source of conflict in the story, as well as a source of frustration. They have been a constant source of tension for the crew of the Dome for six months now, as they are the only source of fresh air for the inhabitants of the dome. They provide the only way in which they are able to communicate with the outside world, and they are essential to the daily life of the crew. They also provide the means of communication between the outer world and the Dome, which is a very important part of the story. Without them, the crew would not be able to function in the way they do.",
    "The Grannies, or Granitebacks, are a group of people who live in the Oceania Sector 4B area of the Dome. They are described by Isobar as \u201csweet snakes of Saturn,\u201d and they are described as having long, skinny legs. They have long, gray hair, and their skin is pale and lustreless with a belly full of atoad. They smell of fresh, scented, oxygen-genated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units. They also have greenish-green hair and are described to have large, bulbous feet. They walk on the surface of the planet, and the Dome Commander calls them \u201cGrannies.\u201d They are also referred to as the \u201ccuckoo clock\u201d because of the fact that they are able to hear the Earth\u2019s radio transmissions from the Dome, which is the reason for their presence on the planet. The grannies are also described to be able to communicate with each other through the radio transmissions.",
    "The story takes place on the surface of the moon of Luna. It begins with Isobar and his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna discussing the weather forecast for the week of May 15-21. The Dome Commander\u2019s niece, Miss Sally, calls him to ask him about the weather in Oceania Sector 4B next week. She has a swimming date at Waikiki, but she won\u2019t make the shuttle unless the weather is going to be nice. He tells her that it\u2019ll be swell all weekend, so she can go. He finishes the weather report, enters the Home Office records, and makes a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. He then goes to the central section of the Dome for his daily worksheet. He notes the proper figures under the headings Sun Spots, Max Freq., and Min. Freq. This done, he draws a clean sheet of paper with the Mercator projection of Earth on it. Next, he sketches some curves in blue and redink upon a Mercator projected of Earth. He writes a note under the word Clear, under the column headed Cond. of Obs, and under the name of Sunspots. Then he sketches a few curves on a piece of paper for the weather on Earth. Finally, he writes a report on the report to the Dome Commander. He goes to his office, where he meets Sparks, the other radioman in the room. Sparks tells him that he has to get the report rolling for Roberts and Brown, the two men who have gone outside to make some repairs to the dome. The next part of the conversation takes place in the office of the other radioman, O.Q., which is located on the opposite side of the room from the Dome. The room has a desk, chair, and bureau, and there is also a commissary. There is also an air-conditioner, which keeps the air in the dome fresh and clean. The dome is a large, glass-like structure with a glass bowl and ultraviolet rays filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps that do not burn the skin. The air is clean and fresh, and the temperature is very hot. There are greener grass, flowers, birds, and people in the garden. The planet is covered in an atmosphere shielded by an atmosphere-shielded sun, and it has greenery and greenery in the form of trees, greenery, and tall grass. The sky is blue with an atmosphere shield. The buildings are made of glass, and they are covered in a thick layer of dirt. The building that houses the radio transmission station is located in the center of the building.",
    "Isobar Jones is an employee of the Experimental Dome on Luna. He has been working in the Dome for six months. He is described as a tall, lean, gangling man with a skinny frame. His lean frame is immured, and he has been for six tedious Earth months beneath the impervite hemisphere of Lunar III - the frontier outpost that serves as a rocket refueling station, teleradio transmission point, meteorological base, and meteorological station. He writes forecasts for each sector of the Dome, outlining the meteorological prospects for each area. He enjoys this part of his job, as he enjoys imagining such pastimes as each geographical division\u2019s terrain makes possible. Isobar is a bit of a con-man, as his colleagues refer to him. He doesn\u2019t leave Sparks\u2019 turret after the sheets are delivered. Instead, he hangs around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally turns to him in sheer exasperation. He notes the proper figures under the headings Sun Spots : MaxFreq. - Min. Freq. ; then he sketches careful curves in blue and redink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which is his daily worksheet. This done, he draws a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer, and begins writing. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word Clear which, six months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed: Cond. of Obs. He also notes the figures for Sunspots: Maxfreq. and Min. Freeq. He points out that the Earth radioman has a bag of noise in his cubby, but Sparks insists that he cannot bring that bag-full of noise up to the Dome with him because he has sensitive eardrums. He then tells him that he is entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock, who wants to play peekaboo while the contact is open. He explains that he just called to ask about the weather in Oceania Sector 4B next week, but he cannot make it since he has a swimming date at Waikiki, so he will only go if the weather is fine. He finishes the weather report, and returns to his work. He does not leave the Dome until the end of the story.",
    "The story begins on a Saturday night at The Space Room, a picturesque oasis of old Martiancharm situated on the Grand Canal in the heart of Marsport. Only half a mile from Chandler Field, landings site of the first Martian expeditionnearly fifty years ago in 1990. Avisitors to the hotel, lunch room or cocktail lounge will thrill at the sight of hardy space pioneers mingling side by side with colorful Martian tribesmen. An evening at the Space Room is an amazing, unforgettable experience. Of course, the folders neglect to add that the most amazing aspect is the scent of the Canal\u2019s stagnant water - the root-of-all-evile vaporate from your pocketbook like snow from the Great Red Desert. We were sitting on the bandstand of the candle-lit cocktail lounge with our four-piece combo. There were only three of them tonight. Their bass man can\u2019t be here, but Ke-teeli, our boss, is descending upon us with all the grace of an enraged Venusian. Ke-Teeli, sometimes referred to as Goon-Face and The Eye, leered coldly down at me from his eight-foot-three. His eyes are like blackneedle points set deep in a mask of dry, ancient, reddish leather. Ees no feedle man, ees no job, he squeaks. I sighed. This was the week their contract ended. Goon Face had displayed little enough enthusiasm for their music as it was. His comments were either too loud, too fast, or too soft. The real cause of his concern being, I suspected, the infrequency with which his cash register tinkled. But, I added, even if the new man doesn't come, we\u2019re still here. We\u2019ll play for you. I glanced at the conglomeration of uniformed spacemen, white-suited tourists, and loin-clothed natives who sat at an ancient stone tables. I looked at The Eye. The transformation of his gaunt features disappeared and were replaced by a black-toothed, crescent-shapedsmile of delight. He shone like a kid seeing Santa Claus. Then it happened. The bass fiddle, an enormous black monstrosity, swept across the dancefloor like a cold wind, was a refugee from a pawnbroker's attic. It was queerly shaped, too tall, too wide, and more like a monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass-shaped bass. The fiddle was not unaccompanied as I\u2019d first imagined. Behind it, streaking over the floor in awaltz of agony, is a little guy, ananimated matchstick with a flat, broad face that seemed to have been compressed in a face. His sandcoloredmop of hair reminded me of a field of dry grass, the longstrands forming loops that flanked the sides of his face, and his pale blue eyes were watery, like twin pools of fog. His tightfittingsuit, as black as the bass, was something off a park bench. He could have been anywhere betweentwenty and forty. He spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if anxious to conclude the routine of introductions, but I was working on his plan. His plan was to find a way to get back to Marsport, the Marsport union. A moment of silence. I echoed at last, how to get there. My gaze turned to the dance floor, and they were as cold as six Indians going South. We'll talk about your plan at intermission, I said, shivering. Now, we'd better start playing. John, do you know On An Asteroid With You? I know everything, said John Smith. I turned to my piano with ashudder. I didn't dare look at that terrible fiddle again. He was almostskeleton thin, like most Martians, and so tall that if he fell down he'd be half way home. I gulped. Our bass man Can't be here but we've called the Marsports local for another. He'll be here any minute. He will be here in a few minutes. He is almost skeleton thin, thin, and tall; he is tall; I gulps. I can't believe he's so tall. I think he's got a plan. I'm sorry I'm late, but he is working on my plan.",
    "John Smith is a bass fiddle player from Marsport. He is a ragged little man out of a hole but he is money in the bank to Stanley\u2019s four-piece combo. His music is straight from heaven. He was lucky to find it in a pawnshop five thousand years ago. He plays it because it is the only one in existence. He pats the hole in it tenderly, but it isn\u2019t the right one. He tries to find a hole in the mirror-like wood of the fiddle, but the aperture is too small for his instrument to fit through. He decides to go to the black pit of Neptune, which is the home of washed-up interplanetary musicians. The home of the uranium pits of Neptune. He wants to make it back to Lunar City, but there is no one to play bass there. So, he goes to The Space Room, a picturesque oasis of old Martiancharm, situated on the Grand Canal in the heart of Marsport, half a mile from Chandler Field, landings site of the first Martian expedition nearly fifty years ago in 1990.

His tightfittingsuit, as black as the bass, was something off a park bench. It was impossible to guess his age. He could have been anywhere between twenty-five and forty. The bass thumped down uponthe bandstand. Hello, he puffs. I'm John Smith, from the Marsport union. He's sorry I'm late, but I was working on my plan. A moment's silence. Your plan? I echoed at last. How to get back home, hesnapped as if he should have known it already. Hummm, I thought. My gaze turned to the dancefloor. Goon Face had his eyes onus, and they were as cold as six Indians going South. We'll talk about your plan at intermission, I said, shivering. Now, we'd better start playing.

And I didn\u2019ts dare look again at the second monstrosity, the onenamed John Smith who is descending upon us with all the grace of an enraged Venusianvinosaur. I gulped. I closed my eyes and plunged into a four-barintro. Hammer-Head joined in on vibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet, and then\u2014 My eyes burst open. A shiver coursed down my spine. The tones that surged from that monstrous bass were ecstatic, they seemed to envelop the entire universe. They held a depth and a volume and arichness that were astounding, that were like no others I\u2019d ever heard. First they went Boom-de-boom-doo, boom, de-booom-de, boom, and boom. But there was something else, too. There were overtones, and the depth of those chords actually set my blood tingling. I glanced at the cash customers. The real cause of his concern being, I suspected, the infrequency with which his cash register tinkled. But, I added, even if the new man doesn't come, we\u2019re still here.

He plays a four-barintro with Hammer-Head on drums and Fat Boy on clarinet, and then John Smith joins him. The sound of the bass fills the room, and the crowd is mesmerized by it. The band plays On An Asteroid With You, modulated into Sweet Sally from Saturn, and finished with Tighten Your Lips on Titan. They wait for the applause of Earth people and the shrilling of the Martians to die down, then turn to John and his fiddle. John plays a Zloomph, the only one in existence. He pats the hole in it tenderly, but it isn\u2019t the right one. The aperture in the v-shaped fiddle looks like a mirror-like wood, and there are overtones of a whole chord with each beat.

And I didn\u201dt dare look again at the second man, the onenamed John Smith. He\u201ds almost skeleton thin, like most Martians, and so tall that if he fell down he\u201dd be half way home. He speaks shrilly and rapidly, but he is also tall; he\u201csuddenly\u201d tall. I\u2019m sorry I\u201dm late, but I was working on my plan. A moment of silence. I sighed.

    "Jimmie Stanley and his band, The Space Room, are sitting on the bandstand of the Grand Canal in the heart of Marsport, half a mile from Chandler Field, the landings site of the first Martian expedition nearly fifty years ago in 1990. They are sitting at the bar of the candle-lit cocktail lounge, and their bass man, Ke-teeli, is descending upon them with all the grace of an enraged Venusian. He is almost skeleton thin, like most Martians, and so tall that if he fell down he\u2019d be half way home. Their bass man can\u2019t be here, but we have called the Marsport local for another. He will be here any minute, so we\u2019ll play for you. Our bass man is John Smith, from Marsport union. He\u2019s sorry I\u2019m late, but I was working on my plan. Your plan? I echoed at last. How to get back home, hesnapped as if he should have known it already. Hummm, I thought. My gaze turned to the dancefloor. Goon-Face had his eyes onus, and they were as cold as six Indians going South. We\u2019'll talk about your plan at intermission, I said, shivering. John, do you know On An Asteroid With You? I know everything, said John Smith. I turned to my piano with ashudder. He was almostskeleton thin, and he was tall enough to fall down. I gulped. And I didn't dare look again at the second monstrosity, the onenamed John Smith who was descending upon us. I closed my eyes and plunged into a four-barintro. His tightfittingsuit, as black as the bass, was something off a park bench. He could have been anywhere betweentwenty and forty. The bass thumped down uponthe bandstand. Hello, he puffed. I'm sorry I'm late, he's sorry I can't be here. A moment's silence. His comments are either, Ees too loud, too fast, or ees too slow, too soft. The real cause of his concern being, I suspected, the infrequency with which his cash register tinkles. But, I added, even if the new man doesn't come, we're still here. I glanced at the conglomeration of uniformed spacemen, white-suited tourists, and loin-clothed natives who sat atancient stone tables. You wouldn't want to disappoint your customers, would you? Ke-teli snorted. Maybe ees betterdey be deesappointed. Ees betterno museek den bad museek. Eys betternon. I don't dare think what kind of soul-chillingtones might emerge from its ancient depths. And he didn't even want to look again atthe second man, the one named John Smith; he shrilled in his nasal tenor; he was almost skeletons thin and tall; he had pale blue eyes and watery, watery eyes with twin pools of fog; his tight-fitting suit was black as fog; and his hair was sand colored like a field of dry grass. His sandcoloredmop of hair reminded me of fields of grass, the longstrands forming loops that flanked the sides of his face. He had sandcolored hair and blue eyes. His skin was watery and blue, and his tight fidget-drums and clarinet sounded like they came off a bench. I looked at The Eye; he looked like a matchstick with a flat, broad face; his flat-broad face was compressed in a vice; his sandcolored mounds of hair and long strings of hair formed loops on either side of the face. The sound of the bass was ecstatic, and it seemed to envelop the entire universe. There were overtones of a whole chord with each beat, and the fullness of those fullness, the depth of those incredible chords set my blood tingling. I could feel thetingling just as one can feel the vibration of a plucked guitar string. He looked at the cash customers. They looked like weary warriors, and seemed in a kind of ecstatichypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced Martians stopped sipping their wine-syrup and nodded their dark heads in time with the rhythm. The Eye was mesmerizing. He started playing Sweet Sally from Saturn, and The Eye looked like The Eye. The transformation of his gaunt features disappeared and were replaced by a black-toothed, crescent-shapedsmile of delight. His eyes shone like a kid seeing Santa Claus.",
    "John Smith is the bass fiddle player for the Marsport union. He is a tall, thin man with sandy hair and blue eyes. His pale blue eyes are watery with twin pools of fog. His tightfittingsuit is black as black as the bass, and it is impossible to guess his age. His hair is sandy with a field of dry grass on the sides of his face. His sandcolored hair reminds me of grass, and the long, fringe-like loops on his face are reminiscent of the fields of grass. His skin is pale and blue, and he has a thin, flat face with a flat, broad face. He speaks with a shrill voice, and his voice is like blackneedle points set deep in a mask of dry, ancient, reddish leather. His eyes are filled with the root-of-all-evilevaporate from your pocketbook like snow from the Great Red Desert. His voice has a depth and a volume and arichness that are astounding, like no others I have ever heard. First they went Boom-de-boom, de-booom, and boom, and then boom, boom-doo-de, boom, doo-doo, boom. But there is something else, too, that John is not just playing a whole chord with each beat, it is the depth of those chords that sets his blood tingling. He looks at the cash customers, and they look like weary warriors. Even the silent, bland-faced Martians stop sipping their wine-syrup and nod their heads in time with the rhythm. John plays a bassfiddle, which is the only one in existence. He pats it tenderly, but it isn\u2019t the right one. He tries to find a hole in it, but the aperture is too small. He decides to go to the black pit of Neptune, the home of washed-up interplanetary musicians. There, he plays Sweet Sally from Saturn and Tighten Your Lips on Titan. He finishes On An Asteroid With You, modulated into Sweet Sallyfrom Saturn, and finished with Tighten your Lips from Titan. We waited for the applause of the Earth people and the shrilling of the Martians to die down. Then he turns to John and his fiddle. If I didn't hear it, I gasped, I wouldn't believe it! And the fiddle's so old, too! added Hammer-Head who, although sober, seemed quite drunk. He tried the holein it, too. I studied the black, mirror-like wood. I wondered what the hell he was talking about. He was lucky to find it in a pawnshop. Only it\u2019s not afiddle but a Zloomph. The aperture inthe v like wood. The fiddle has overtones of overtones, so that it is full of the fullness of those chord notes, but there is also a depth to each chord. He plays a few more notes before he finishes Sweet Sally. He goes on to play tightens your lips on Titan and tightens the lips on Earth. He then finishes On an Asteroid with you and Sweet Sally on Saturn. The audience applauds and the applause dies down. He turns to Jack, the drummer, and tells him that they will talk about his plan at intermission. Ke-teeli, the boss, is descending upon him with all the grace of an enraged Venusian vosaur. He shrills in his nasal tenor. He says that he knows everything, and is almost skeleton thin, like most Martians, and so tall that if he fell down he\u2019d be half way home. I gulped. Our bass man can't be here, but we have called a Marsport local for another. He\u2019ll be here any minute. He tells us that the new bassman will be here in a few minutes. I think he is coming now. The bass thumped down up on the bandstand. The sound of the bass thumps down uponthe bandstand, and a little guy named John Smith. Hello, he puffs. He talks shrilly and rapidly, as if anxious to conclude the routine of introductions. I'm sorry I'm late, but I was working on my plan. A moment's silence. I sighed. This was the week their contract ends. His words were either, Ees too loud, too fast, or is too slow, too soft. The real cause of his concern being, I suspected, the infrequency with which his cash register tinkled. But, I added, even if the new man doesn't come, we\u2019re still here. His cash register is infrequently, but he's still here, we'll play for you. I glanced atthe conglomeration of spacemen, white-suited tourists.",
    "The story begins with two people, a man and a woman, looking down at Earth from a ship that has just landed on Earth. The ship has been searching for a place to live for 2,000 years, and they have found it. The man and woman are on Earth, and the President of the Council tells them that Earth is not habitable for them, and that they must stay on Earth because there is no place else for them. The President is overwhelmed by the news, and he cannot go on, so he asks the woman and the man to go back to Earth and wait for the rescue ship. The two men and woman go to the council chamber, where they are met by the President and the officials. They tell the officials that Earth will not be suitable for them to live on, because they have not been able to find another planet that they can live on. The officials tell them that the atmosphere on Earth is so toxic that it would disintegrate a human being, so they have to stay. The men and the woman return to the ship, where the President gives them a microphone to tell the people of Earth\u2019s great new life waiting for them on the new planet. The story then fades in and out of the screen, showing the men and women arriving on Earth in a great, white ship. They are greeted by a crowd of people, including the President, and are told that they have made a complete failure of their mission. The whole planet is uninhabitable, and Earth is to be saved by a rescue ship, but the President says that he can\u2019t go on because he is overwhelmed with the amount of people that have died, so the ship must return to Earth. He hands the microphone back to the man and says that they will get the full truth to Earth when they return. The woman and man return to their ship and tell the President that they are coming in, and then the screen fades out, showing them the red planet that has been found. The red planet is filled with glowing white light, and it is revealed that it is the home of a thousand years ago that Earth was given to them by a group of people who were looking for a new planet that could be habitable. The planet is described as green and lush, and there is a bright, red sky with a pink sky, and yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting, and rockets are seen in the background of the picture. The people are terrified of the unknown, and when the red ball pulls away from them into the blackness, they are aware of the rocket flame shooting away in all directions, and a flash cuts the darkness, like the flare of a match. Suddenly, the watchers catch the awareness of the death of a ship and are also aware of streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them. They see creatures in squares and circles, wriggling, in lumps and blobs, rolling, jumping, and crawling, and saw them in cloud forms whisking about, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They also see creatures hopping about on one leg, and others crawling at incredible speeds, and some with all the numbers of legs and arms in between. The creatures seem to be there but invisible, and those watching the screen on which time and distance are a compressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and thousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks and whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning, and were aware of this ocean of blackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must ever move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck that is Earth.",

They both want the best of Earth. However, they are also aware that Earth is not perfect, and they do not want to go back to it. They want to live on Earth, so they choose to stay. They are both attracted to Earth because it is clean, green, and moist, and there is a great new life waiting for them there.",
    "The mission that Michael and Mary were sent on is to find Earth. They have been searching for Earth for 2,000 years for a truth. They were given Earth because Earth is the only place that they can live on, and there is no place for them on Earth. The rest of the planets in the galaxy are given to other people, so they have no place to live. They are told that Earth is perfect for them, and they have to stay on Earth because there is nothing else for them to do on Earth, and Earth is clean and green and moist. The ship that they are on is a white ship that has been traveling through space for two thousand years looking for Earth. It was given to them by the President of Earth, who is overwhelmed by the fact that they have not found it, and he cannot go back to Earth because he has lost so many of his people.

    "The President\u2019s communciations to the public and the reasoning behind his choices are different from those of the other characters in the story. In the first part of the story, it is revealed that the President is overwhelmed by the news that Earth has been found and that Earth is uninhabitable. He is angry that Earth will not be able to sustain life on Earth, and that the people of Earth will have to settle somewhere else. The President is also angry that the Earth people will not accept the Earth that they have found, and will only accept Earth as a place for them to settle. He does not want Earth to be a place where people will settle and where they will have a chance to make the best of Earth. He wants Earth to remain as it is, and Earth to stay as it has been for 2,000 years.",
    "The lockets are the source of the conflict in the story. They are the cause of the war between Earth and the other planets in the solar system. The other planets are given to other people, and they have no place on Earth. The people of Earth are given Earth because Earth is the only place for them to live. The rest of the planets have been given to others, so there is no place for Earth for them. The Earth people have been searching for a place to live for 2,000 years, so they have to stay on Earth because there is nothing else for them on Earth, and Earth is their home. The space ships that the Earth people are on are the ones that landed on Earth two thousand years ago, and now they are returning to Earth because they have found a new home for Earth. Earth is a perfect planet, and the people are happy to stay there because it is clean, green, and moist, and there is a great new life waiting for them, open and green and moist on a virgin planet. However, Earth is not perfect, and those who left with them are dead. They have made the worst of it, and so they are here to stay and die.",
    "The story begins with a family dinner. Danny, Kevin, Kevin\u2019s brother, and his sister, Sylvia, come into the dining room. Danny is upset with Kevin for picking on poor Kev, who is a psi-deficient. Kevin tries to explain that it is not his fault, and that it will come out some day. His mother, father, and brother all seem to be upset with him, and he is not allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. His sister, however, is upset because she does not want to make an appointment for him at the clinic again, and she is the only member of the family that seems to like him in spite of his handicap. Father, on the other hand, does not seem to understand why Kevin cannot adapt to the environment to which he is fundamentally unsuited. Danny and Kevin go to the kitchen, where he complains about the tablecloth that is spread out on the table, and Danny apologizes to him for his part in it. Kevin is angry because he does not understand why he cannot adjust to an environment that he is fundamental unsuited to. His father, who has been to the same place many times before, is also upset because he can\u2019t seem to find a cure for his son. Danny then goes to the living room, where his mother is sitting, and Kevin is furious with her for not listening to him. Danny comes back from the kitchen with a tray of food floating ahead of him. He tells them that he has to set the table because his father is a sight-faster person than he is, and they cannot afford to allow him to go on such a trip alone. Kevin explains to them that his family thinks of him as a bundle of no-talent because he cannot telepath, telekinesthesize, teletype, or telepathize. He also explains that he can't precognize or prefix or teletype because he is an animal and cannot graft psi powers onto an atavism. Kevin then goes on to tell them about his inability to adapt to their environment because he has no control over his own mind. His family is angry with him because they do not believe that he will be able to make the long trip to the clinic that he needs to make. Kevin goes to sleep, and when he wakes up, his mother and father are furious with him. His brother, Danny, comes into the kitchen and tells him that he cannot make the appointment because he did not understand what Kevin was trying to say. Danny explains to him that Kevin is not supposed to have any Psi powers because nobody is allowed to have them because they are useless to him because of the way he was brought up. Danny also tells Kevin that they will find a way to adapt him to the right environment in the future, but Kevin does not believe him. The family goes to bed, and the next morning, Kevin wakes up with a hangover. He is angry at his family for treating him as an animal, but his mother tries to comfort him by explaining to him about how he can adapt to a normal life. Kevin tells her that he doesn't understand why his family treats him as if he is incapable of doing anything. He then tells her about his ability to telepathically communicate with other people, but she refuses to believe him because it is illegal. The next day, Danny comes to the table to apologize to Kevin for his actions. Kevin says that he knows why he is upset, but he cannot understand why the family is upset. Danny tells him to leave, and then his mother comes in to tell him that she has to change his dress because she can't bear to see him like this. The rest of them are angry with Kevin.

He is the only one who has the ability to see into the future, and his family treats him as a member of their family. He has been to the Weather Bureau many times, and the family believes that he has some sort of psychic ability, which is why he is able to see the future. He also has a lot of psychic power, which he uses to his advantage in the beginning of the story. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clearer and clearer that he does not have any psychic powers of his own. Instead, he is an animal-like being with no control over his own body, which causes him to be treated as an animal rather than a human being. His family views him as an unwanted member, and they treat him as if he is incapable of doing his job. This makes him resentful and angry, which makes him angry at his family for treating him like an animal. He wants them to treat him like a human, but they do not understand him because he is not a human. He does not understand why his family is treating him this way, and it frustrates him to no end.",

He had been working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy of the book when his family was having breakfast with his mother, father, brother, sister, and mother. He was working in the dining room and collided with a floating mass off-abric, which promptly draped itself over him. He managed to get his head free and set the table, but his brother, Danny, lost his mental grip on him. When Danny apologized to him, Kevin realized that the tablecloth had spread itself out on the table. His mother and father were upset with him, and his sister, Sylvia, was angry with him for picking on poor Kev. Danny, the youngest brother, was also upset with Kevin for his behavior, and Father, the head of the family, was trying to show off as if he were still a kid. Kevin had been studying for every faculty under the sun, and he had been tested for telepathy, telekinesthesiology, precognizance, telekinesis, etc. He can\u2019t precognize or prefix or prepossess, so he is strictly a bundle of no-talent. He cannot telepathically or telekinetically, but he can pre-position or teletype. He is also unable to speak or teleport, so his ability is limited to reading minds. His family thinks of him as an animal, which is why he is not allowed to have any psychic abilities. Kevin is a poor atavism with no control over his own body, which causes him to become angry and upset all the time. When he is twenty-five years old, his family discovers his power. He has been trying to find a way to adjust to an environment to which he is fundamentally unsuited for his whole life, but it is not easy. His parents are angry at him for not being able to adapt to their environment, and it is revealed that he is a psi-deficient, a throwback to an earlier era. The only person who can help him is Danny, who has been testing him for years to see if he has any psychic gifts, but Kevin is not interested in hearing him out. The family believes that he has some kind of test for it, but they cannot figure out what it is yet. Kevin has to make an appointment for an appointment with a psychiatrist at the clinic, which he does not want to go to, because his family does not trust him to be able to make such a long trip all by himself.",

His father is a traveling salesman, and his mother is an old-fashioned woman who doesn\u2019t hold with robocooks. Even his brother, Danny, is not considered to be of equal importance to Kevin, as he is a mere primitive with no ability to speak or telepathically communicate with other people.

    "The story begins with Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command looking at buildings on a dead planet called Tyban. He wonders if there is any significance in the number of buildings on the planet. Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, tells him that it looks like a temporary camp, and all built out of native materials, the only stuff available. The buildings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind, and the rock itself is native, and was cut out a long while ago. The ship is circling around the planet, looking for a place to set up shop, and he sees a city that looks very old. He is about to call for altitude when he sees that the city is dead. He looks down on splintered walls that are like cloudy glass pieces rising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center of the city, there is a huge, charred hole at least three miles indiameter and very deep. In all the piled rubble, nothing moved. He goes down low to make sure, then brings the ship around and heads out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun. He sees the third planet, a hot, heavy world that has no free oxygen and from which the monitors have detected nothing. He tries to find the fourth planet, but it is too hot, too heavy, and too far away for him to make any progress. After a while, the ship moves up the zone, scanning, moving in the familiar slow spiral of the stars. Faint dark shapes of bare rocks and hills move by below, and when he looks up, he sees the flat, weathered stone of the buildings. The main screen being on, the whole crew sees it. He turns the screen to full magnification and watches silently, and after a while he sees another city, the main screen shows a city. The crew members stop to stare at the buildings, and then he realizes that they are too old, they are not native, they must have been cut out long ago. He thinks about how important it is that Ball's question be answered, they have been in space for only three hundred years. He pauses, thinking, if the aliens are alien to this world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one of the other planets here, they had starships and were warlike. Then, thousands of years ago, he begins to realize how important this discovery is to him. He begins to think about why buildings have to be built in stone, to last, they shouldn't have had a need to build, unless they were castaways. The only reason they would need a camp would be because the ship left and some of them stayed, but then the ship must have come back. He stops kicking at the sand and looks up into the blue-black mid-day sky. The report is negative. The third planet is the only one with a decent temperature range, but the planet has a CO 2 atmosphere, so he thinks about moons. He decides to try to find them, and goes down through the clouds, and sees a third planet with a blank, gleaming ball until they are in close. The planet is blank, the blankness resolved into folds and piling clouds and dimly, the surface shows through. The surface of the planet is covered in a black depression, and there are no buildings. He notices that the buildings are made of a flat, smooth, smooth stone, and they have no airlocks. He realizes that there is no reason for them to have built them, they should have been made of native material. He heads out to look for the answer, he pauses and thinks, break out the radiation suits, but he can't be sure, they haven't heard from them since. He starts thinking about how the aliens were brought to this planet, he decides to go down and look for an answer. He stands there and looks at the walls, they look like they are old. The two men stand for a long moment in silence. He has a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this is too old; he reaches out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stoneridges of the wall. He reaches out and runs it over smooth stoned ridges of the walls. Although the atmosphere is very thin, he noticesthat the buildings had not been war on Earth or near it for more than three hundredyears.",

The planet has a dead fourth planet that has been dead for three hundred thousand years. There are no buildings on the planet, only a few buildings made out of native materials. There is a huge, charred hole at the center of the city that is three miles in diameter and very deep. The buildings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind, and the rock itself is native to the planet. The ship is on a mission to find an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. Steffens is the captain of the Mapping Command, and Ball is the executive officer of the ship. They are exploring the planet in search of an answer to the question of why the aliens from the fourth planet came to this planet, and how did they get to Earth? The planet is cold, hot, and has a CO 2 atmosphere. The third planet is a blank, gleaming ball until they are in close, and then the blankness is filled with folds and piling clouds, and dimly, the surface of the planet shows through. The ships goes down through the clouds, clearing the last few miles on the edge of the twilight zone. The moons of this solar system have yielded nothing, but the third planet, a hot, heavy planet with no free oxygen, is all that is left. The fourth planet is the only one that has a decent temperature range, and it has CO 2 in its atmosphere, so they could try to find out more about the aliens. The building that the ship is looking at are the ones that the aliens built, and they have not heard from them since, so it is unknown how long ago they came from. They have no idea how they got to Earth, but they have been in space for only three hundred years, which gives them a good head-start. The story also takes place in the early days of the human race, when men were still pitching spears and killing each other. They had starships and were warlike.

The crew members believe that the aliens are from outer space, but they have not heard from them since, so they have no idea how they got to the new planet. The ship is exploring the planet in search of a new home for the aliens, but it turns out that they have been gone for so long that they can\u2019t be sure of their exact location. Steffens, the captain of the ship, thinks that they must have been on the planet for so many years that they are no longer able to find a place to live. He thinks about how important it is for the crew to find out where the aliens come from and why they are on this planet. He also thinks about the fact that they built these buildings in stone, which is very unusual for a planet that is so old. He wonders why they would have to build such a large number of buildings, but the crew thinks that it is because they were castaways.

They have been in space for hundreds of thousands of years, and they have been searching for a new planet to settle on for the past 3,000 years. The robots are able to communicate with each other and communicate with the ship, which is why Steffens thinks that they are the same people as the ones on the fourth planet. They also have an eye that can see all the way to the top of the head, and the rest of the robot\u2019s body is made of plastic. The robot has a band of clear plastic-like stuff that runs round the back of its head. On top of this, there is a round spot of plastic that is joined by black metal. The angle of sight is perpendicular, so the robots can see the whole of the body, except for the part that is on the top. When the ship lands on the planet, the robots get out of the ship and walk towards the ship. They walk on the surface of the planet and walk through the buildings. The ship is able to detect the movement of the robots because the ship is in the twilight zone, which prevents them from being detected by the Mapping Command.",

He believes that the aliens have been in space for three hundred thousand years, so they have a long head start on Earth. He also believes that they have been there for a long time, so there is no reason for them to have left anything behind. He thinks that the only reason they would need a camp would be because they were castaways, and castaways would have left something behind. When he sees the buildings, he wonders why they have to build them in stone, since they shouldn\u2019t have had a need to build. He wonders how the aliens got to the planet, but he also wonders how they got to Earth. When the ship goes low, he sees that the buildings are old, and he thinks that they must have been built long ago. He decides to go down and look for the answer, but the radiation on the planet is too high for him to be able to make an accurate estimate of how long ago the aliens came from, so he decides to stay on the ship. He sees a huge, charred hole at the center of the city, three miles in diameter and very deep. Steffens goes down low to make sure, then brings the ship around and heads out across the main continent into the bright area of the sun. The rocks roll by below, and the planet has no vegetation at all, and there are no more cities. The ship circles around to the dark side of the planet. The third planet, a hot, heavy world which has no free oxygen, is all that is left. At a height of several miles, the ship moves up the zone, scanning, moving in the familiar slow spiral of the Mapping Command. Faint darkoutlines of bare rocks and hills move by below. After a while he sees a city. The main screen being on, the whole crew sees it. Someone shouted and they stop to stare at the buildings. He looks down on splintered walls that are like cloudy glass pieces rising above a plain, rising in a shattered circle. Near the center, there is a huge hole at least three miles indiameter, and nothing moved. He notices that the rock itself is native, indicating that it was cut out a long while ago. Ball points out that it would take even a brisk Earth wind at least several thousand years to cut that deep, and wind here has only a fraction of that force. The two men stand for a while in silence, thinking about how important it is for the aliens to be found. He pauses, thinking. If the ones on the fourth planet were alien to this world, they were from outer space, could not have come from one of the other planets here. They had starships and were warlike. Then, thousands of years ago, he begins to realize that it really was important that the ship be answered. He begins to think about the importance of this discovery, and decides to explore the planet and find out more about the aliens.",
    "Mr. Michaelson, an archeologist from Earth, is exploring the ruins of an ancient city called Alpha Centaurus II, a colony from the fifth planet of the system. He comes across a native man named Maota, who is upset with him for trespassing on his territory. The native is upset because the archeologist has not told him about the old city, which he considers to be beautiful, but Michaelson insists that he must leave. The man is angry at the fact that Michaelson has been there for so long, and asks him to leave now. The archeologist explains that he is the keeper of the city, and that the city needs to be preserved for future generations. He explains to the native that he will build a museum, where he will collect all the old writings and perhaps decipher them. However, the native says that he cannot leave now because the city is in a state of decay, and the future generations will thank him for saving the city. He tells Michaelson to leave, and Michaelson says that they will build the museum, and put everything under glass to stop the decay. The story then moves to the beginning of the story, where Michaelson is in the doorway of a large circular building. He sees a man to watch, who tells him that there is one of the intelligent ones in the building, which makes him suspicious. He goes into buildings without thinking of roofs falling in, or decayed floors dropping from under his weight. He begins to collect small items, making a pile of them in the street, an ancient bowl, metal untouched by the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest detail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He finds books still standing on ancient shelves, but he is afraid to touch them without tools. Darkness comes swiftly and he is forced out into the street. He stands there alone feeling the age of the place, even the smell of age in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered through clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness, dead and still, waiting for morning so it can lie dead and lie still in the sun. He crawls over the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation of ages. He digs experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog, under a roof that has weathered half a million years of rain and sun. Then he crawls out again, covered in dust and cobwebs, and tells the native to leave the city because it is not sacred to his people. He walks away from the old man, heading for another building. The webfoot is following him, and he tells him to stop. He turns and walks off, not looking back. The old man hits him, quickly, passionately, and drops the weapon beside his body. He then walks off toward the hills outside the city where he finds a place to hide. He hides in a cave, where there is a place for him to rest. He thinks about the Inca\u2019s treasure, Pompeii, and Egyptiantombs, but none can hold a candle to this city. The Inca is the most fascinating thing he has ever seen. Mr. Earthgod.... Don\u2019t call him that. He is not a god, and you know it. He laughs. He points out the inscriptions on the wall, which are angry. The spirits are angry; wind has blown sand against them for eons, and rain and sleet, but their story is there, once they decipher the story. He also points out that the wall is made of metal, an alloy that is impervious to rust and wear. He shows the native a wall with inscriptions that say \u201cThe Spirits are angry\u201d; the native is angry. He says that the spirits may return, but the spirits are never coming back. He decides to stay, so he goes back to the cave.",
    "The story takes place in the world of Alpha Centaurus II, a colony from the fifth planet of the system. The story begins with Michaelson, an archeologist, exploring the ruins of a dead city. He finds a native man who is upset with him for trespassing on his sacred ground. The native is upset because the archeologist has not told him about the old dead city, and the native is curious about what he is doing in the city. Michaelson is angry because he has found the most fascinating thing he has ever seen: the Inca\u2019s treasure, Pompeii, and Egyptiantombs. The city is filled with the smell of old age, and there are buildings that have been standing for millions of years. There is also a wall that is made of some metal, an alloy that is impervious to rust and wear, and inscriptions on the walls that tell the story of the spirits of the old city. Outside of the city, there is a hill where they will build a museum to store all the old books and documents. There are also small rooms in the hill that look like they were once bedrooms. Inside of the museum, there are books that have not been touched in so long that they have begun to deteriorate. In the end, the story ends with the two leaving the city together.",
    "Mr. Michaelson is a native of the planet Alpha Centaurus II. He is a tall, gaunt man with long gray hair and no shoes. His wife died many years ago on Earth, so he has no children. His friends do not look for him for another day at least. He does not want to kill him, but if he must, he cannot leave the city because his step may destroy the home of some ancient spirit. He has been in the city for a long time, and he is the keeper of the city. He laughs at the native\u2019s insistence that he must leave, but he is serious when he says that the city needs a keeper because the spirits may return one day. He talks about how he will build a museum, right here in the street, and over there on the hill just outside the city, where they will collect all the old writings and perhaps decipher them. He also talks about putting everything under glass to stop the decay. The native is angry at the fact that Michaelson has mocked him, and the archeologist reminds him that no spirits are ever coming back to this city, and even if they did, they would care nothing for old cities half covered with sand and dirt. He walks away from the old man, heading for another building. The sun has already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He looks off down the street and tries to ignore thenative, trying to feel the life of the old city as it might have been. He crawls over the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation of ages. He digs experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog, under a roof that has weathered half a million years of rain and sun. He stands in the doorway of a large circular building. He sees a man to watch, one of the intelligent ones, and goes about satisfying his curiosity. He enters buildings without thinking of roofs falling in, or decayed floors dropping from under his weight. He finds books still standing on ancient shelves, but is afraid to touch them without tools. He goes out into the street to gather small items, collecting them in a pile of them. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest detail, shows how identical they had been to Earthmen. He climbs a tall building, and sees a webfoot. The webfoot draws closer, and Michaelson tells him to leave. He thinks about how the city is sacred, but not to its gods, and warns him to not touch, not walk upon, not handle. He turns off, not looking back, and walks off into the hills outside. He tells the webfoot to stop following him, as the city will not be safe for the spirits to return. He then goes to the museum, where he meets a man named Maota, who tells him the story of the Inca's treasure, the ruins of Pompeii, and Egypt's ancient cities. He asks him to help him preserve them, but Michaelson refuses. The man tells him that they must leave now, because the city may be destroyed one day, and they must not find their city packaged and preserved and laid out on shelves for the curious to breathe their foul breaths upon. He says that they will leave now because the future generations will thank them.",
    "The webfoot is a native of the planet Alpha Centaurus II. He is a tall, gaunt man with long gray hair. He has no shoes, and his webbed feet drag in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. His toes are webbed, and he walks with no shoes. He speaks in a language that is similar to Earthman\u2019s, but he is not a god. He does not want to kill Mr. Michaelson, because his step may destroy the home of some ancient spirit. His breath may cause one iota of change and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness, so he must go. The webfoot has a small device in his hand that measures time, and it is attached to a tiny cylinder that can take him to the place of the dead. He also has a watch that measures the amount of time that has passed since the beginning of the story. His name is Maota, and the story is that he is the keeper of the city. He wants to preserve the city for future generations, but the archeologist insists that he must leave now. He thinks that the city is in a state of decay, and future generations will thank him for saving it. He talks about how he will build a museum, right here in the street, and they will collect all the old writings and see if they can decipher them. The native is very curious about the city and its history, but Michaelson tries to ignore him. He says that no spirits are ever coming back to the city, and even if they did, they don\u2019t care for old cities. He walks away from the old man, heading for another building. The sun has already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He turns and walks off, not looking back, and is followed by the webfoot.",
    "The cylinder is significant because it is the only reason why Michaelson is in the city of Centaurus II in the beginning of the story. He is the first to find it, and he is the one who finds it in the first place. It is the reason why the native is upset with Michaelson, and why he refuses to let him leave the city. He does not want to destroy the home of some ancient spirit, as his breath may cause one iota of change and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. The cylinder contains the story of the native\u2019s ancestors, and it is significant in that it is written in a language that the native does not understand. It also contains the names of the four major gods, which the native cannot understand, but it is enough for him to understand that they are there.",

    "The story begins with the assistant administrator of the Bureau of Population Equalization, Roy Walton, sitting in his office. He has just received a report from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in Patagonia. The report is dated 4 June 2232, six days prior, and goes on to say that the population of the area is still below optimum, and the population density is 17.3 per square mile, which makes it a prime candidate for equalization. Walton is busy, so he cannot see Mr. Prior for at least three hours, but the annunciator tells him that he must see him immediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment. Walton hears an angry male voice muttering something in the outer office, and he refuses to see him. The next report is from the Zurich Euthanasia Center, where eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard adults have been sent in the past week. Walton initializes the report, earmarked it for files, and dumps it in the pneumochute. The three security men catch up to him, and when he tries to explain to them that he is not planning to assassinate anyone, he is hit by one of the security men. Walton has removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that trimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed the massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents, but themark of the last century is stamped irrevocably on both building and office. His desk is piled high with reports, and more keeps arriving every minute. The job of assistant administrator is a thankless one, he thinks; as much responsibility as DirectorFitzMaugham, and half the pay. He lifts one report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothing the crinkly paper, and reads it. It is a despatch from the head of the police in the state of population equalization in the area, Horr\u00f6cks, who tells Walton that there is a man named Lyle Prior, who wants to see Walton. Walton agrees, but he is interrupted by three men who come rushing through the door, claiming that Prior broke into his office and ran away. Walton tells them that Prior is clean, and they give him an efficient going-over. Walton waits until the men leave, and then he jams the lock of the lockstud to prevent them from leaving. His tirade, he knew, was whollyunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations prescribed, Prior would never have broken in. He cannot admit that to the guards. He takes a seat, Mr. Walton, and thanks you for granting him this audience. At any other time I'd have had you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a littlediversion. I realize you're a terribly busy man, I am. I'm very lucky to have hit the psychological moment for your entrance. At the end of the story, Prior says to Walton that he has to thank him for his entrance. He is very lucky because he would not have been granted this audience if it weren't for your presence. Walton says that he doesn't want to be the master of life and death, and Prior says that it is his job to save humanity from its own folly. Walton thinks of himself as a pawns in a chess game, not as human beings. He forced himself to cling to one of Director Fitzgerald's oft-repeated maxims, If you want to stay sane, think of these people as pawns. Walton sighs, this was the biggest chess problem in the history of humanity, and all the solutions led to checkmate in a century or less.

The goal of the new order is to prevent the human race from perishing due to a lack of elbow room in the future. As a result, the population on Earth has reached seven billion. The new order wants to redistribute the excess population to fertile areas in Patagonia in order to save humanity from its own folly. In order to achieve this goal, the government has set up a program called \u201cEqualization\u201d.

His desk is piled high with reports, and more keeps arriving every minute. The job of assistant administrator is thankless one, he thinks; as much responsibility as DirectorFitzMaugham, and half the pay. He lifts a report from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in Patagonia, and reads it. It was dated 4 June 2232, six days before, and after along and rambling prologue in the usual Horros manner it goes on to say, Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, farbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization. Walton agrees. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, Memofrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of... He paused, picking a trouble-spot at random,... central Belgium. Will thesection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability of transferring population excess to fertile areas in patagonia?Recommendation: establishment of industries in the latter region, to easetransition. He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of lightshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by the multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand Belgians into the area. He forced himself to cling to one of Director Fitzgerald's oft-repeated maxims, If you want to stay sane, think of these people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings. Walton sighed. There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the voice of the assistant, reestablishing a new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff of three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating irrelevant data. He takes another report from a data sheet of the Zurich Euthanasia Center, and gives it a cursory scan. The three security men catch up to him and swarmed all over him. One of them turns apologetically to Walton; the other two give Prior an efficient going-over, and Walton tells them to take him to security, or downstairs to health. They waste no time in leaving. Walton waits until the door is closed and jams down hard on the lockstudio. His tirade, he knew, was whollyunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations stipulated, Prior would never have broken in. He goes to the guards, and they leave him.",

Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck! You, Chip told him serenely, have no appreciation of beauty. What do you think of it, Padre? Salvation Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black, a lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his weathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. Well,my boy, he admitted, there is some Biblical precedent for your\u2014ahem!\u2014clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coatwhich was of many colors.Stick-in-the-muds!

I'm going to take a night off, throw myself a party thelikes of which was never seen around these parts. Put a candle in the window, chilluns, 'cause li'l' Chip won't be home till the wee, sma'hours! Syd chuckled. O.Q., big shot. But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-jointentertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer! Chip's voice lifted in a note of jubilant surprise. Johnny Haldane, a S.S.P. man chuckled and returned Chip\u2019s greeting with abone-grinding handclasp. When he saw him meandering across the Casino, you could have knocked him down with a jetblast. What's new? Is old Sydstill with you? But he's back at the spaceport. Plating a private cruiser. And he tells Chip how they discovered an entire mountain of the previous new element, No.97 in the periodic table, on frigid Titania, satellite of far Uranus. It was touch-and-go for a while, but they passed through the flaming caverns like Shadrach in the Bible, and here they are! A mountain of ek alastron! he gloated. A metal strong enough to crush diamonds toash, but so resilient that, when properly treated, it would rebound like rubber! What are you going to do with it, Chip? Put it on the ship!",
    "The Lorelei is a beautiful woman from outer space. She is described as tall and slender with tumbled silver hair and tumbled locks of hair framing her silver-framed face. She stands in the background of Chip\u2019s conversation with Johnny Haldane, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black, and stands next to Chip in a small, dimly-lighted private bar. The woman is described to be the most pious man in space, and she is also conceded to have the best hand with a gun. She has a reputation for being a danger to spacemen, and Chip tells her that she is the greatest contribution to spaceflight since Biggs\u2019locity-intensifier. She was discovered on a planet called Titania, a far-off satellite of far Uranus. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent, and unheeding to the words of the God who rules all. The old man reminds Chip that he is not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who espouses the principle of turning the other cheek to evildoers. He is a devoutly religious man with the heart of an adventurer, and he has taken upon himself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the god that his God worships. The story of Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of anger and retribution, is made evident by the methods that he has employed in winning his converts. He also tells Chip that the woman is not the ordained emissary of any church, but he is the one who brings the story to the outlands of the planetoids. He explains that his mission is to carry to outlands tribes the stories of Yahweh, the fierce Yahveh, and his methods are to win their converts.",

The main cabaret is too crowded; he passes through it and another equally blatant room wherein twoscore Venusians are straining the structure with a native sing-stomp, and ends up in a small, dimly-lighted private barunfrequented by anyone save a bored and listless Martian bartender. The chrysanthemum-pated son of the desertland rouses himself as Chip enters, rustling his petals and pipes a ready greeting. He orders a new bottle of scotch and tells the bar-keep that he has a lot of back-to-back drinking to catch up on. Chip flips a golden credit-token back at him, and he starts work on another one. He emits a deep sigh of satisfaction, and turns from the mirror to face his two companions. There, he sees Johnny, who is tall and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, alwayslanguid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem.

Johnny says soberly, Syd's just fooling, but I would becareful if he were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law and order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as well as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent and unheeding the words of Him who rules all. The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that Salvation Smith was not one to those milk and water missionaries who spelt out that he would not be one of them. He takes Chip to XU\u2019S SOLAREST Barroom, where he is immediately deluged by a bevy of charm-gals vying for the privilege of helping him beat the roulette wheel; (1) helping him drink the house dry, and/or (2) separating him as swiftly as possible from the credits in his money belt. Chip shakes them off, gently but firmly. He wants to go to the spaceport, but Syd tells him to stay and watch 'em. Chip is off alone, so he goes into the lock of the Chickadee onto the soil of the asteroid Danae. He walks along briskly toward the town beyond the town, and as he gains the main drag he finds himself rubbing shoulders with citizens of every known world. Lumbering, albino Venusians, petal-headed Martians, Jovian runts, greenies from far Uranus, Earthman - all were here.

    "The ekalastron or No. 97 is an element of the periodic table. It is light enough to carry in one hand enough to coat the entire hull of a battleship, and is strong enough to crush diamonds to shatter.

The film will deflect a meteor, and it will last for hundreds of thousands of years. Chip plans to put it on the ship, and the crew is very excited. They will also use it to coat it in a thick layer of epoxy resin, which will protect the ship from cosmic rays. Chip also plans to use the film to coat his ship with epoxy.

    "The story begins with a hunt party of the explorer on the planet of Minos, led by June Walton, M.D., Hal Barton, MD, June\u2019s brother, and George Barton, and their guide, the tall colonist, Mr. Patrick Mead. They are on a mission to find a cure for the plague that has been plaguing the planet. They have been warned about the dangers of the disease, but there is nothing they can do to prevent the spread of the plague. They meet a strange creature that looks like a man, a magnificently muscled, lean, graceful, human-like creature. He is taller than the rest of them, and he has red hair, blue eyes, and a crossbow slung across his shoulder. He introduces himself as Patrick Mead, a hunter and bridge carpenter, and says that he has never met any medicos before. He tells the group that he is from a planet called Minos and that there is a population of only one hundred and fifty. He also tells them that there was a plague on this planet three generations ago, and that no one has been able to cure it. He explains that the people of the planet are immune to the disease because they look alike, which is why he thinks that it is the only way people can look. The group goes to see the creature, and they are surprised to find that it looks just like them. The creature is named Mac, and it is described as a handsome man with red hair and blue eyes with freckles on his face. He talks to June over the intercom, and she tells him that he needs a shave. He then tells her that he will give her a call when they return to the ship. The men return to their ship, where they are greeted by the mayor of Alexandria, who sends greetings from the city. The crew of the ship is shocked to find out that they have landed on a planet that is not on the map. The colonists are afraid that the plague has spread, but the mayor assures them that they will be able to get rid of it. They go to see Mac, who is tall, handsome, and handsome, with long, reddish hair and a clean, clean beard. The story ends with the colonists on the ship, and the story is over.",
    "In the beginning of the story, we see June Walton, M.D., Hal Barton, Hal\u2019s brother, and George Barton, and Patrick Mead, a hunter and bridge carpenter, walking through the forest of the planet Minos. They are on a mission to find a cure for the plague that has been plaguing the planet. They meet a strange creature that looks like a human-like creature with red hair, blue eyes, and a crossbow slung over one shoulder. The creature is taller than the rest of them, and it has red hair and blue eyes. When they approach the creature, they realize that the creature is actually a man named Patrick Mead. He is tall and tanned, with freckles on his face, and wavy red hair. He also has blue eyes and is wearing a fishbowl helmet. He tells them that he and his family have been on the planet for three generations, and that they are immune to the plague. He explains to them that the disease that they have been suffering from came from a ship that went off into space to avoid the contagion, and the ship never came back. The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtights spacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion. He then tells them about the melting sickness, a disease that killed everyone on the ship. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to do about it, and now the people are left to fend for themselves. June and the other members of the team, Hal and his brother, are horrified to learn that the plague has come back, but they are unable to treat it because there is no way to do so because the ship is too far away from civilization. They decide to return to the ship, where they will be able to treat the disease.",
    "The melting sickness is a disease that affects the inhabitants of the planet Minos. They have been warned about it, but no traders have come to the planet yet. They are afraid of the spread of the disease, so they do not know how to treat it. The people on the planet are immune to the disease because they are related. The disease is caused by a mutation in the cells of the animals that cause them to become sick. The mutated cells are able to spread through the air, which causes the melting sickness. The symptoms of the illness are similar to those of the common cold, but the symptoms are not the same as those of a cold.",
    "Each of the members of the Explorer follow a set set of guidelines for health safety on the planet of Minos. The first one is that they wear spacesuits for protection against the dangers of the plague. The second one is to wear protective suits for their own personal safety. The third is to carry a weapon, and the fourth is to use a knife and bow. The fourth one is required to wear a helmet with a microphone for communication with the outside world. The last one is the most important one, as it is the one that allows them to communicate with each other.",
    "The story takes place on the planet of Minos. It is described as a homelike planet with green and copper leaves, purple and red foliage, and bright greenish sunlight. There are trees that look like leaves in fall, and there is a forest that looks like a fall forest in the fall. There is a tall, bronze man who is taller than the rest of the group, and he introduces himself as Max Stark, M.D. He is a hunter and bridge carpenter who has never met any medicos before. June Walton is a doctor, and she is accompanied by her brother, Hal Barton, and her husband, George Barton, who is also a doctor. The story begins in the forest, where the group of explorers is walking along a narrow trail. The forest is lush and green, and the trees look as if they have been there for hundreds of years. The trees are tall and colorful, and they look as though they have never been touched by anything other than the sun. The men and women of the crew of the ship, the Explorer, walk through the forest looking for a specimen to test for the plague. They see a man, a magnificently muscled, lean, graceful, human-like creature, who looks at them without expression, and a crossbow slung across his shoulder. The man is tall and handsome, and his green spacesuit makes him look like a handsome man. He introduces himself to June as Hal Barton\u2019s brother, and asks her out for a drink. He tells her about the history of the planet, explaining that it has been colonized by humans for three generations, and that there is no other place like it on Earth. He also tells her that there was a plague that came about three generations ago, killing everyone except the colonists, who are immune to it. The people of the colonized planet look like they are all related, and it is the only way they can look, so they all look the same. June and the other members of the team, Hal and his brother, are horrified to learn that the plague has come back. They are afraid of the spread of the disease, but he assures them that it is not impossible to treat. They go back to the ship laughing, exchanging anecdotes with him.",
    "The story begins with a newborn baby Sim being born. His mother and father are in a cave, and he is being fed by his mother. A man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible, a man with a dying face. The man is in the corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of his face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozennight planet. Sim\u2019s mother feeds him pebbles, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavernentrances, and eats, eliminating, eating again, he grows larger, larger. He sees the old people sitting in the tunnel beyond this living quarter, and as they die, their agonies fill the cave. The cave people live in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day offlame. Only at dawn and sunset is the air breath-sweet, flower-strong, and then the cave peoples bring their children out into a stony, barren valley. At dawn the ice thaws into creeks and rivers, and at sunset the day-fires die and cool. In the intervals of even, livable temperature, the people live, run, play, loved, free of the caverns. Plants grow instantly, and small, legged animallife rushes frantically through the rocks. Sim understands this, a matter of hours after birth. Racial memory blooms in him. He would live his entire life in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone channels of air, he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep never, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming. And he would live exactly eight days. Eight days from now he will stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his father now stands, staring uselessly at his own wife and child. This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every second of it. He must search his parents\u2019 thoughts for knowledge because in a few hours they will be dead. This is so impossibly unfair. Sim quieted, and images of life in this cave, the dying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through his new, small head. This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the days were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The people lived in cliffs, and the only time of the day was dawn and dusk. The men and women from the crash lived and died in a week, leaving their children to do likewise. Sim understood this, and in the next instant, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across space from a distant green world, crashed on this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls, they tumble men, women, and children. Ten thousand years ago, the crash victims hid in cliffs. Fire, ice, and floods washed away the wreckage of the huge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon a forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened, two hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Old age came rushing. Children were born in caves, swifter than ever before. Men and women died from old age. The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone crib, at the little girl. The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up, weeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth trembled and jerked. The father ran across the cave and grabbed the knife of his dying father, who was poised to kill him. The knife was high suspended, suspended, ready to destroy him. Sim's mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the weapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their conflicting minds. Let me kill him! The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. Hurry. Feed the child, he said, exhausted. It is almost dawn and it is our last day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow. He falls upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new lungs. With a soft padding of naked feet, Sim's father runs across the c",
    "The story takes place on a planet that is next to the sun. The people live in a cave that is covered in ice and are covered by a thick fog. The planet is very cold by day and very hot by night. There is a cave where the cave people live. The cave people have two hours outside of the cave each day, and they eat and sleep inside the cave. There are caves where they keep their children, and there is a tunnel beyond the cave that leads to the ship. The ship is more than half an hour away, which is the limit of life on the planet. The story begins in the cave, where Sim is born, and his mother feeds him food and feeds him. He is then taken to the cave where his father and mother are sitting. There, he sees his father, who is old and withered, and a man with a dying face. The man is sitting in the corner of a cave with a knife in his hand, and Sim sees the old people who are dying in the tunnel beyond. When the people die, Sim watches them and thinks about how impossible it is to live a long life on this planet. He begins to think about the long-lived planet and how it is impossible for a newborn child to think, see, understand, interpret, and interpret. He thinks about the possibility of a life of long lives, valleys not of blasted stone, green foliage, and temperate climes, and wonders how his people got into such a condition. He sees an image of metal seeds, blown across space from a distant green planet, fighting with long flames, crashing on this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls, they tumble men and women. Ten thousand years ago, the crash victims hid in the cliffs, and fire, ice, and floods washed away the wreckage of the huge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon a forge. Solar radiations drenched them, and their pulses quickened, two hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Old age came rushing. Children were born in the caves, and swifter, swifter the process. Men and women from the crash lived and died in a week, leaving children to do likewise. The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone crib, at the little girl. The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband\u2019s grasp, stood up, weeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth trembled and jerked. The father fell back against a crib, staring at another figure inside that stone crib: another child, feeding itself, moving its delicate hands toprocure food. His sister. Sim sees a knife poised over the face of the old man, and the knife is high, suspended, ready to destroy him. His father runs across the cave; his mother screams. The knife is pulled, and he falls upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moistened lungs. The webbed face of his father jerks over him, the knife was poised, and in the next few seconds, the man is no longer there. Sim thinks about his parents\u2019 thoughts for knowledge; he must enjoy every second of his eighth part of his life, because in a few hours they will be dead. He must search their minds for knowledge, for he is the fifth-thousandth in a long line of futile sons. After eight days, he realizes that he will live exactly eight days.",
    "The relationship between Sim and his father is one of love and survival. They have a loving relationship. They care for each other deeply and are devoted to each other. Sim\u2019s mother feeds her husband, and he feeds her food. When he wakes up in the cave, he sees his father in the corner of the cave with a knife in his hand. When his mother screams, he hears her crying, and when his father tries to kill him, he runs across the cave to save his life. When Sim sees the old people dying, he understands that his life is over, and that he must find a way to save them. He thinks about the long life he has been dreaming about, and realizes that he has eight days left in this world. He tries to think about the possibility of a future with his parents, but his thoughts are interrupted by the realization that he will die in eight days. This realization makes him realize that he is the fifth in a long line of futile sons. He wonders if there is anything he can do to save the family and save his own life.",
    "The planet is a cold, arid planet that is covered in ice and covered in a thick fog. The people live in the cliffs to escape the incredible heat of the sun. The nights are very cold and the days are like torches of fire. It is a violent, impossible world, with people living in the caves for two hours a day outside. The planet is full of life, with the cave peoples bringing their children out into a stony, barren valley.

Here, in stone channels of air, he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep never, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming. And he would live exactly eight days. The man in the corner of the cave is his father; the man\u2019s eyes are alive in his face; he holds a crude stone dagger in his withered hands, and his jaw hangs loose and senseless. Then, Sim sees the old people sitting in the tunnel beyond the cave; they begin to die; their agonies fill the cave. Their faces are mature, smooth, alive, electric. The next minute, a desication and burning away of their flesh occurs. Sim thrashes in his mother's grasp; his mother holds him. She holds him, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, will cause her husband to rise again. The father falls back against a stone crib, and Sim sees another figure inside: an Agirl-child, feeding itself, moving its delicate hands toprocure food. The mother wrenches the dagger from her husband's grasp, weeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth trembles and jerks. The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looks vacantly into the stone crib at the little girl. One-eighth of her life's over, already, and she doesn\u2019t know it. As Sim watches, his own mother seems to shift and take a tortured,smoke-like form. The thin bony face breaks out in a maze of wrinkles. She was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling the knife to her shriveled breasts. Sim cries steadily. He thinks about his parents\u2019 thoughts for knowledge; in a few hours they will be dead. This is so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatalstate, he dreamed of long lives, valleys not of blasted stone, valleys of green foliage and temperate climes. And if he had dreamed thenthere must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the longlife? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and depressing in eight short, vanishing days? As if at a button pressed, he sees an image. Metal seeds, blown across space from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing on this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women. Ten thousand days ago.

The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of the moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home to find his people. He decides to go after them, as he has been away from them for too long. The old man tells him that he is staying, but he cannot, as the Earth people have no room for him and he can\u2019t blame them. The Kumaji will kill him for being a renegade, and he has lived a good, long life, so he has no regrets. He tells him to hurry, as his people are after them. After a while, the old man calls out to him, telling him that the water in the well is bitter, and the water is not brackish. He spat out the water, then kneels and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost choking, and rinses his mouth. His lips and mouth are paralyzed by the poison. He walks quickly across the well-square to the house, inside of which is dim but hardly cooler. The table is set in his aunt's house, and a coffee pot is on top of the stove. The unicopter can hold two in a pinch. He brings the unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and a whine of turbojets, and lands in front of the slow-moving column. He alights in the sand and watches the people on camels for their life here on the Sirian desert, deciding the Earth camel is a better beast of burden than anything the Sirius II wastelands have to offer. They walk through the desert with the great-humped beasts of burden, the animals piled high with the baggage of their belongings. They move through the sands with agonizing slowness. After only one day, he sees the caravan in the desert and asks a man named Tobias Whiting, who is in his mid-forties now, why he is here. He is the most successful man in the Colony, and his bitterness surprises Steve. He recognizes the man now as Tobias, who had been the Colony's most-successful man when Steve was a boy, and in a way, Steve could not blame him. He thought it would help if he could find some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way he felt, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists, trekking across a parched desert, to the safety of Oasis City. He thinks back to the memories of his childhood, where his parents died in a raid, the community center, the well, the mud-brick house with four walls and a roof, the village where he spent his happiest days as a child. He remembers the well from which all the families drew their water, the house with a roof and a canteen, and an old man resting in the shadows. The man who tells him what happened is a withered old man, all skin and bones and sweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin is almost black. He offers him water and tells him he is too old to fight, but Steve refuses. He recounts his childhood memories, including the well where he drank out of a ladle and the house where he grew up, and tells the man that he wants to stay. He turns the little turbo-jet engine over, turns away before it could berefused, and returns to the village. He gives him his canteen and runs back to his house. The story ends.",
    "Tobias Whiting is the leader of the Kumaji. He was the most successful man in the Colony when Steve was a boy, and he was also the first to admit that the colony was not good enough for his people. He had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. He is twenty-five years old now, but he looks much younger than that. He has been away from his people for so long that he has forgotten how to speak English. He does not speak much English, but his English is good enough that he is able to recognize the faces of his people when they come to see him. When he first sees Steve, he is shocked to find out that they are gone. He asks him what happened to them, and Whiting tells him that the well was poisoned, and the people had to flee because they had no water to drink. He also tells him the story of how he and his people had moved to Oasis City, which is five hundred miles away from the colony. He then tells him about how he was the first one to see the people after they left the well, and how they had to leave because they were thirsty and needed water. He tells him how he had lived with his aunt after his parents were killed in a Kumaji raid, and that he had spent his happiest time as a boy in the community center, where he had made his happiest memories. He told him about the well that they used to draw water from, but it had been poisoned. When the people come back, he tells them that the water is bitter, and they have to drink it fast, or else they will die. He gives them a canteen to drink, and then he goes to his aunt\u2019s house to make coffee. He goes to the well again, and this time it is clear that it is not brackish, but bitter-sweet. He returns to the village, and tells the people to hurry, because the Kumajis are after them. He finds the old man, who is resting, and asks him if he is going to kill them. The old man says he is too old to fight, too old for anything but death, so he tells him to go after the people, but the man tells him he is staying because he has lived a long, happy life. The man then gives him his canteen, and when he drinks the water, it is bitter and tastes like sand, and his mouth is paralyzed by the poison. After a while, he gives him a cup of water to rinse his mouth, and after he drinks it, he decides to go back to his home. He explains to the people that he will stay because he is the only one who will ever have the only home he will have.",
    "The story is set in a distant future where humans have established a colony on a distant planet called Sirius. It is a parched desert wasteland where the Kumaji, a nomadic people, have accepted the colony as a fact of their life on the desert. The people of the planet live on a single well from which all the families draw their water, and there is a mud-brick house with four walls and a roof. There is also a community center, a well, and an old man resting in the village. The story also takes place in the early 20th century, when the Earth colonizers had established a small town called Oasis City. The town was built at the confluence of two underground rivers that came to the surface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground. It was almost five hundred miles away from the colony, and the people had to trek through the desert to reach it. The well was poisoned last night, and three people died, leaving the colonists with no choice but to leave the settlement. They had to go, and go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses. The village was deserted, and a man named Tobias Whiting, who had been the Colony\u2019s most successful man when Steve was young, came to see him. He was probably in his mid-forties now, twenty years older than Steve, but he was well-muscled, his flesh was solid, and his step bold and strong. He had lost a lot of weight in the past few years, and he was no longer the successful man he was when he was young. He seemed to be in a state of hopelessness and hopelessness when he approached Steve, who was angry that he had abandoned his people. The old man told him that he was too old to fight, too old for anything but death, and that he should stay with his people, so he went to his house, where there was a coffeepot on the stove and a partially-consumed dinner still on the table. After a while, he gave him his canteen, and Steve went to the well to drink some water. He returned to his aunt's house, which was dim and cool, but hardly cooler. He walked quickly across the well-square to her house. The table was set in the kitchen with a coffee pot, and last night's partially cooked dinner was there. The sun was searing and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's spaceship. He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring at him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizards curried away. Earthman! a quavering voice called. Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community centre, a Kumaji was resting. He is a withered old man, all skin and bones and sweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin is almost black. Steve held the canteen to his throat working almost spasmodically to get the water down. The water was bitter. He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost choking, and spat out the sand. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with the poison. He walks quickly back to the house, and when he gets inside, it is dim and very cool. The unicopter can hold two in a pinch. He turns the little turbo-jet engine over, then on impulse runs backto the old man and gives him a canteen. He goes to the village, turning away before it could berefused, and returns to the unicopter and gets himself airborne without looking at the deserted village or the Old man again. The whole village is deserted. The man called after him: Tell the people to kill the Kumajis looking for them to kill, desert wind ought to wipe out their trail, but hurry.... The voice faded into the faint rushing sound of the hot desert wind. Steve gazed down on bare sun-blasted rock, on rippled dunes, on hate-haze. He circled wider and wider, searching for his people in the immensity of sand and wastelands. He brings a unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and a whine of turbojets. He alighted in the sand in front of the slow-moving column.",
    "The Kumaji are a nomadic people who live in the desert of the planet Sirius. They are nomadic and rely on the water that they get from a single well for their sustenance. They have never accepted the settlement of the nearby Earth colony as a fact of their life on the planet. When Steve was a boy, he learned about the frequent Kumaji raids and how they had increased in violence due to the Earth government's inability to protect its distant colony. The colonists had to go, and go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses. Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City? They have to, the old man says. Men, women, and children are after them. He thinks it would help if he could find some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way he felt, he knows, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists, trekking across a parched wilderness. He walks quickly across the well-square to his aunt's house. Inside, it is dim but hardly cooler. He scowls, not understanding. The table is set in his aunt\u2019s house. A coffeepot is on the stove and last night's partially-consumed dinner still on the table. The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of the moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth. He goes to the well and hoists up a pail of water. The water is bitter, not brackish. He spat with fury, then kneels and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost gagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen and rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with the poison. He walked quickly back to the house. The old man's voice called after him: Tell the people to kill the Kumaji looking for them to kill, desert wind ought to wipe out their trail, but hurry.... The voice faded into the faint rushing sound of the hot desert wind. Steve gazed down on bare sun-blasted rock, on rippled dunes, on hate-haze. He circled wider and wider, seeking his people. Hours later he spotted the caravan in the immensity of sand and wasteland. He brought the unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and a whine of turbojets. He alighted in the sand in front of the slow-moving column. It was like something out of Earth's MiddleEast and Middle Ages. They had even imported camels for their life here on the Sirian desert, deciding the Earth camel was a better beast of burden than anything the Sirius II wastelands had to offer. They walked alongside the great-humped beasts of burden, the animals piled high with the swaying baggage of their belongings. They moved through the sands with agonizing slowness. Already, after only one day's travel, Steve could see that some of them were spent and exhausted and had torrid on camelback. The Kumaji had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five hundred to go across searing desert, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding through the sand toward him. The man said he remembered Steve Cantwell, the young man who had come to Earth to get himself educated. He was the most successful man in the Colony when he was young. The bitterness surprised him. He recognized the man now as Tobias Whiting, who had been the Colony's most successful person when Steve was aboy. He is twenty-five years his senior, but he was well-muscled, his flesh was solid, and his step bold and strong.",
    "The old man in the story is named Tobias Whiting. He is the leader of the Kumaji. He was the most successful man of the colony when Steve was a young man, and he is also the one who saved the lives of the colonists. He has been gone for twenty-five years now, but he is still respected by his people. He does not want to fight against the Earthmen, he is too old to fight, he has lived a long life and he does not have any regrets. When the colonists die, he comes to the well to drink some water, but the water turns out to be poisoned. He tells the story of how the colonists had no choice, they had to go, and go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses. The well was the last straw for the colonists, and they have to hurry. The Kumaji are after them, and the old man tells them that they must hurry, they have men, women, and children to hunt them down. The old man also tells them about how he lived with them for a long time, and that he is not going anywhere, he wants to stay with them. The story ends with him dying, and it is up to the young man to find him and kill him.",

He also has an apple-shaped face and a long, gray hair. When Sol first meets him, he tells him that he has not seen him in a long time because he has been so used to the place that he gets confused about it during the daytime. He tells Sol that he dreams about the place every night, and he thinks it is the same place. When he wakes up, he thinks about the wedding he was supposed to attend in Salinas that weekend. He dreams about it again, but this time, it is in the evening. He thinks about it in the middle of the night, too, and wakes up in a strange place.

    "Harry Folsom is a businessman who has been married to Marge for seven and a half years. Marge is a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyes and a shape that could set your teeth chattering. She has a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances long enough to paper the bedroom wall. When she isn\u2019t complaining, she is crying, and when she is not crying, she points out in chilling detail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband. Half of the time she has a beastly headache, and the other half she is sore about something, so ninety-nine percent of the times we get along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case. George is desperate to try to buy himself an Ego Prime. He has spent eight years trying to keep Marge happy, which is exactly seven and half years too long, and he is ready for the Rehab Center in a week. He meets a greasy little man with a black mustache and a bald spot, up in a dingy fourth-story warehouse off Broadway. He is told that he can supply him with a new secretary, but he is not interested in the ordinary Utility model. He wants a Super Deluxe model, very careful workmanship, and practically complete circuit duplication. The little man tells him that he will be delighted, simply delighted. The blanks are very impressive, clay and putty and steel, faceless, brainless. He goes over the measurements of all sorts, checking them thoroughly, and then goes on to the laboratory. He waits in there for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use his Primers. Finally, the door opens and the head of the company, Jeree, comes to see him. She is tall and dark, and she conveys more without saying anything than he ever dreamed was possible. The first day she was there, she conveyed to him very clearly that if he cared to supply the motive, she\u2019d be glad to supply it. That night, he could tell that Marge had been thinking something overduring the day. She let him get the first bite of dinner halfway to his mouth, but then she said, I hear you got a new Secretary today. He muttered something into his coffee cup and pretended not to hear, and Marge turned on her Accusing Look #7. She cannot be much of a secretary, she added. She\u2019s a perfectly good secretary, he blurted, and kicked himself mentally. He should have known Marge was in her traps by then. He tried to argue, but when Marge got going, there was no stopping her. He had his ultimatum, as far as Jeree was concerned, and had to go to the recovery room for two hours. He waited in there until the door opened and the man, Harry, came in. He gave him a big smile. He went on to explain that he would be delighted if he could supply the minute impressions, and Mr. Faircloth was delighted. He left the room. The next morning, he met with the man who knows a guy named Jeree. He told him that they had been expecting him, and that he had been waiting for him all day. He was desperate, so he went to the storeroom to get some blanks for the basic measurement. He hurried him back to a storeroom. He got the idea of going to the lab for the exact measurements, and was delighted when the little man said that he was happy to provide the motive. He took the blanks and left. He then went to his laboratory, where he was delighted to see that the Ego-pantograph was ready to go.",
    "The \u201cPrime\u201d technology is an invention of Ego Prime, Inc., a company that has been in business for a very long time. The company was founded by a man named Hunyadi, who invented the neuro-pantograph. He had no idea what to do with it when he invented it, but a couple of enterprising engineers came along and subcontracted the problems of anatomy, design, artistry, audio and visio circuitry, and so forth, and ended up with the modern Ego Primes that we have today. The technology is completely illegal, of course, and there is a strict set of regulations that govern the use of the product. However, the company was able to put their product on the market at all, once thenation\u2019s housewives got wind of just what their product was. From the first, there was rigid Federal control and laws regulating the products right down to the local level. You could get a license for a Utility model Prime if you were a big business executive or a high public official, or a movie star, or something like that; but eventhen his circuits had to be inspected every two months, and he had to have a thousand built-in Paralyzers, and you had to specify in advance exactly what you wanted your Prime to be able to do when, where, how, why, and under what circumstances. The law didn\u2019t leave a man much leeway. But everybody knew that if you really wanted a personal Prime with all his circuits open and no questions asked, you could get one.

He went over the blanks in the storeroom for the basic measurement, and then hurried me back to the laboratory to have the minute impressions taken. He was thorough, and when he was finished, he took me to the recovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use his Primets to solve all his problems. Then he went to the head office, where he waited for the head of the company, Jeree, to come and give him the coup de grace at coffee the next morning. The next morning, he did. He gave him a Primet, and the next day, he gave him another one. He spent the next two hours under the Microprobes, and spent the rest of the day in the Recovery Room. Then the door opened and the head honcho, Harry, came and gave him the go-ahead to use the Primets. They work like a charm, and they work in perfect synchronization with each other.",

We keep a few blanks here for the basic measurement, but I can assure you you\u2019ll be delighted, simply delighted. The blanks are very impressive, clay and putty and steel, faceless, brainless. He went over me like a tailor, checking measurements of all sorts. He was thorough, in fact, he was finished. I went on to the laboratory. And that was all there was to it. I spent a busy two hours under the NP microprobes; the artists worked outside while the NP technicians worked inside. I came out of it prettywoozy, but a shot of Happy-O set that straight. Then I waited in therecovery room for another two hours, dreaming up ways to use my Primewhen I got him. Finally the door opened and the head of the head honchos, Harry, came in. He told me that he had a solution to all my problems. I had my ultimatum, as far as Jeree was concerned. He said that he would supply all your problems, and an Ego prime would solve all his problems.",

He tells me that he can supply me with a new secretary today. I muttered something into my coffee cup and pretended not to hear when Marge turns on her Accusing Look #7. I also hear that she is five foot eight and tapes out at 38-25-36 and thinks you\u2019re handsome. She cannot be much of a secretary, she added. She is a perfectly good secretary, I blurted, and kicked myself mentally. I should have known Marge's traps by then. I didn't get any supper, and she was still going strong at midnight.

When Marge arrives, he tells her that he cannot marry her because of the Family Solidarity Amendment of 1968, and all the divorce taxes we have these days since the women got their teeth into politics, to say nothing of the Aggrieved SpouseCompensation Act. He says that he would have been a pauper for the rest of his life if he had tried it.

    "The story begins with the pilot of the ship Soscites II, Kaiser, sitting in the pilot chair of the scout ship. The ship has been on the last leg of its planet-mapping tour. It had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scoutship and set itself into a giant orbit about this planet that Kaiser had named Big Muddy. The Soscite II had to maintain its constant speed because it had no means of slowing, and no way to start again once it did stop. The orbit takes about one month, Earth time, to circle a pinpointed planet. Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded hereforever. His memory is so hazy that he cannot tell how long he has been in the ship, but he does remember that he had been communicating with the ship via a communicator. The last communication on the tape is three hours late, and it tells him that he is sick, so he must have been sick for three hours. The next communication is from the ship\u2019s mechanical diagnostician, Sam, who tells Kaiser that his arm has become sick. He is unable to keep down food for eleven hours, and his body has turned very cold. He also remembers that his wife, Helene, does not love him, and she had married him for the security of his pay check. He tries to find out more about her, but she will not divorce him. He wakes up in a cold sweat. The clock shows that only an hour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still five more long hours to wait. He rises and wipes the sweat from his neck and shoulders. After a few minutes, he stops pacing and peeks out into the gloom of the rain. The rain seemed to have eased off some. He opens the door. The scout had come to rest with a slight tilt when he first opened the door, and when he sees the scout, he goes to rest too. He sees that the ship is not moving, and he goes back to sleep. He dreams of his home again, the home he had left behind when he joined the space service to escape from his wife. In it, he is back home again. He had realized soon after his marriage that he did not love his wife and that she did not deserve to stay with him. His wife, however, is still married to him. Her crippled brother moved in with them the day they were married. He took an unhealthy delight in helping his sister torment Kaiser. He woke up in the cold rain and tried to sleep again, but the dream continued. He saw the scout again, and this time, it was in the same place. He went to sleep in the scout's bunk and woke up again. The first was from himself: Your SUGGESTIONS NO HELP. HOW AM I GOING TO REPAIR DAMAGE TO SCOUTWITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT? AND WHERE DO I GET IT? DO YOU THINK I FOUNDA TOOL SHOP DOWN HERE?

Kaiser impulsively reaches impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest against one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots and a plastic hat. He opens the door of the scout. He finds himself in a small corridor of the ship. After a few minutes, he stops pacing and peeks out into a gloom of the darkness.

    "The seal-people are the inhabitants of the planet Big Muddy. They are described as tall, thin, and skinny, with long, gray hair. They live in huts along the banks of the river bank, and they are described to spend most of their time there. The ship that dropped Kaiser off on the planet was on the last leg of its planet-mapping tour. The mother ship, Soscites II, had dropped Kaiser in the one remaining scoutship, and set itself into a giant orbit about the planet, which is why the ship was three hours late in its return message to the ship. They have a limited range of maneuverability, which makes it necessary to set up an orbit that takes about one month, Earth time, to circle a pinpointed planet. Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded hereforever. The crew of the scout ship communicates with the ship via a communication device, and the seal people are the ones who transmit the baby talk messages to the mother ship. The communication device is located in a small corridor of the ship, and it is where the ship's mechanical diagnostician, Sam, is located. Sam is able to transmit information about the stinging in Kaiser's arm, and he tells the ship that he has been sick for a long time, which causes the messages to start coming through in baby talk. This is significant because it is the first time that Kaiser has noticed that the messages are not written in plain text, which raises his suspicions about why they are not being sent through the ship\u2019s communications device. The seal people have a very limited amount of fuel, which means that they have to maintain a constant speed, and there is no way for them to start again once they do stop. They also have no means of slowing down once they stop, so they have no way of stopping, and their fuel is low. The men on the ship are trying to find a way to repair the scout or Kaiser will be stuck here for the rest of his life.",

    "The baby talk in the story is the main reason why Kaiser is stuck on the planet Big Muddy for so long. He has been communicating with his ship, Soscites II, for such a long time that he has not been able to understand the baby talk messages that are being sent from the ship. The ship is on a planet-mapping tour, and it has lost all of its ships, including the one that he was on, and is in an orbit about this planet that Kaiser has named \u201cBig Muddy.\u201d The ship has to maintain its constant speed because it has no means of slowing, and no way to start again once it does stop. This means that it takes about one month, Earth time, to circle a pinpointed planet, and now its fuel is low. Kaiser has that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here forever. The baby talk is the reason why he has been unable to read his last communication, which was three hours late, and why the last message was in plain-terrestrial language. He is unable to understand why the messages are not written in English, and he cannot figure out how the ship is communicating with him in the first place.",
    "Tony Carmen holds his pinkly manicured, flashily ringed hands wide. He sees his problem and it is warmly embarrassing. Really, Mr. Carmen, this isn\u2019t the sort of thing you discuss with a total stranger. He\u2019s not a doctor\u2014not of medicine, anyway\u2014or alawyer. He needs an operator in your line. I work for the United States government. I can\u2019T become involved in anything illegal. Carmen smoothed down the front of his too-tight midnight blue suit and touches the diamond sticking in his silver tie. He has heard of the Mafia, an old fraternal organizationsomething like the Moose or Rosicrucians, founded in Sicily. Itallegedly controls organized crime in the U.S. But that is aresponsibility-eluding myth that honest Italian-Americans are stampingout. We don't even like to see the word in print. Carmen can understand honest Italian Americans feeling that way, but guys like him know the Mafia is still with it. He can put the squeeze on marks like you pretty easy. Carmen tries to find a way to get rid of the bodies they keep leaving in his kitchen. He is unable to neutralize radioactivity because he has not killed anybody since early 1943. He tries to use a larger fuse for a heavier load and jams the switchbox. The lights flickered and the dials on his machine tell him the story. The internal Scale shows zero. Mass zero. The temperature gauge shows that there had been no change in centigrade reading that cannot be explained by themechanical operation of the machine itself. He checked for a standard anti-gravity effect but there was none. Gravity inside the cylinder had gone to zero but never to minus. He was at last violating conservation of energy - not by successfully inverting the cube of the ionization factor, but by destroying mass - by simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side effects. He knew the government wouldn\u2019ts be interested, since he cannot explain how his device works. He cuts corners and bypasses complete safety circuits. He put dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with the wiring diagrams. When he turns the machine on, the lights flicker and hold, he flips his machine into service again. The dials tell him that the internal Scale is zero, but there is no Mass zero reading. He turns it on again, and the temperature is zero again. He checks for gravity, but it is never to zero. He thinks about how to dispose of these bodies for Carmen. He cannot kill them, because he was in the Marines, so he cannot be involved in any illegal business. He does not want them winding up in the D.A.'s bathtub. He calls his late wife, Carmen, who tells him that she can find something in that area of research to help him. He tells her that he can't take too long, because these bodies are accident victims. She says that most of them are accidents, and that they have too much anti-freeze for a summer's day, Spanish-American War vets going to visit Teddy in the natural course of events. Harry Keno just holds them at his place to embarrass him. She also says that she cannot go to the police because she will make him lose his liquor license or take a contempt before the Grand Jury. He says that he cannot kill any of these people because he is a third-generation American, and he cannot understand why. Carmen says that his refusal to tell even a third generation American about the Mafias is why he only works in the small private laboratory owned by himself and his father, instead of working in the vast facilities of Bell, Du Pont, or General Motors. Tothis, he can only smile and nod, but even refusing to be balked by conservative ideas, he fails. All the stories he has ever heard about the Mafia build up an unendurable threat. All right, he says, he will try to help Carmen, but he snorts. He snorted. Carmen is in a private laboratory and tries to explain that he didn't kill any people, he hasn't killed any of them, but... that is, he snorted, he said weakly. He also says he has to kill anybody since 1943. Carmen said that he is in the Marine, and Carmen says he cannot incriminate himself with him, he needsn't incriminate themselves with him. Carmen tells him to not kill anybody, he was a Marine, Carmen said hotly. He knows that he did not kill many people, Carmen says. He smoothed his suit and touched the diamond in his tie.",
    "Tony Carmen is the owner of a small private laboratory, owned by himself, his late wife\u2019s father, and the bank. He works for the United States government, so he can\u2019t get involved in anything illegal. He is a third-generation Italian-American, but he refuses to tell Professor Venetti about the Mafia because he is ashamed of what he has heard about it. He has been trying to find a way to neutralize radioactivity in order to get rid of the bodies that the government keeps leaving in his kitchen. He tries to find some kind of incinerator to burn the bodies, but it turns out that there is no way to do that because the bodies do not get hot enough to burn. When he turns on his machine, the lights are flickered and the dials on his control board tell him that the temperature is zero. He turns it on again, and it is hard to take, but there it is. Mass zero. The temperature gauge shows that there had been no change in centigrade reading that cannot be explained by themechanical operation of the machine itself. He checked for a standard anti-gravity effect but there was none. He was at last violating conservation of energy - not by successfully inverting the cube of the ionization factor, but by destroying mass - by simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side effects. He knew the government wouldn\u2019ts be interested, since he cannot explain how his device works. He subcontracted that work from the big telephone laboratories. He does not want them winding up in the D.A.'s bathtub. Why not? How could they trace them back to him? You\u2019re the scientist, Professor. I got great respect for those crime lab boys. Maybe the stiff got some of my exclusive brand of talcon it, I don't know. Listen here, Carmen, I said, what makes you think these bodies are going somewhere? Think of it only as a kind of\u2014incinerator. The gadget don't get hot so how can it burn? It don't use enough electricity to fry. It can't cut 'em up or crush 'em down, or dissolve them in acid. I've seen disappearingcabinets before. Mafia or not, I saw red. Are you daring to suggest that I am workingsome trick with trap doors or sliding panels? Easy, Professor, Carmen said effortlessly shoving me back with onepalm. I'm not saying you have the machine rigged. It's just that you have to be dropping the stuff through a sliding panel in\u2014 you know, the one with the trap doors. I can't explain how it works, but I shrewdly judged that Tony Carmen wouldn't ask an embarrassinghow when he is incapable of understanding the explanation. He goes on to say that he is not saying that the machine is rigged, but that it is a little black box that is useful for getting rid of things. The ideal solution would be to neutralizer radioactivity, alpha, beta, X, and X et cetera rays, but this is easier said than done. Carmen tries to solve the problem by boiling contaminated water. It does make the hot stuff vaguely easier to handle but it is not a breakthrough on the central problem. Now, in the middle of this, he is supposed to find the way to dispose of some damned bodies for Carmen. Pressed for time, he begins experimenting. He cuts corners. He bypasses complete safety circuits. He puts dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with wiring diagrams. If he got a passable incinerator, he would behappy. He turned the machine on. The lights pop out. He flips his machine into service again. The dials show zero, and there is a mass of silver alloy inside. The internal scale shows zero. His machine is completely gone. He had had a slightly hot bar of Silver alloy inside, and Mass zero; he checked for gravity, but the temperature was completely gone; there was no suddendischarge of electricity or radioactivity.",
    "Professor Venetti\u2019s inventions are little black box-like contraptions that are useful for getting rid of radioactive wastes. They work by neutralizing radioactivity by changing the cube of the ionization factor, which is the mass of the radioactive matter, and by destroying the mass by simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side effects. They do not use enough electricity to burn the bodies, so they do not burn, but they do concentrate the radiations, which makes the hot stuff easier to handle. They also do not work to destroy energy without producing energy or matter because they can put the squeeze on marks like Professor Venetti pretty easy. The machine is controlled by a switchbox, and the dials on the control board tell the story of the story: zero. Mass zero. The temperature gauge shows that there has been no change in centigrade reading that cannot be explained by themechanical operation of the machine itself. There had been no suddendischarge of electricity or radioactivity. Gravity inside the cylinder had gone to zero but never to minus. He checked for a standard anti-gravity effect, but there was none. He was at last violating conservation of energy by destroying mass by turning off mass. The device does not use any electricity to fry the bodies because it does not have enough heat to do so. It also does not cut the temperature because it is not used to cut the heat of the bodies. However, it does work to concentrate the radiation. He also does this by turning on a switch that turns off the heating and cooling of the body. This makes the bodies easier for him to dispose of them. He does not want them winding up in the D.A.'s bathtub because he doesn\u2019t want them to trace them back to him because he is the scientist.",
    "Global warming is one of the main themes of the story. Throughout the story, the main character, Professor Venetti, tries to find a way to neutralize the radioactivity in the bodies that people keep leaving in his kitchen. He tries to do this by destroying the mass of the radioactive matter with his device, but he is unable to do so because the mass is too much for the device to work. He also tries to get rid of the bodies by burning them in a furnace, but this does not work because the furnace leaves ashes and teeth in the garbage disposal, which is an interesting problem for him. In the end, he realizes that the bodies are going to the D.A.\u2019s bathtub because he is the scientist, and he does not want them to be traced back to him. The story ends with the bodies in the bathtub.",
    "The first part of the story is about Professor Venetti\u2019s search for a way to dispose of radioactive bodies for the government. He is working on something to get rid of trash for the U.S. government, but he is unable to find a way because his research is restricted information. He subcontracted this work from the big telephone laboratories, so he has no way of finding it out. The government wants him to find some way to neutralize radioactivity, which is the most important problem any country could have in this time of growing atomic industry. The AEC had found that burying canisters of hot rubbish in desert or in the Gulf had become unsatisfactory because Earth tremors or changes of temperature split the tanks in the ground, causing leaks. Through the SBA he had been awarded a subcontract to work on the problem. The ideal solution would be to neutralizer the radioactivity emanating from the bodies, but this is easier said than done because there is no way to destroy energy without producing energy or matter. The solution is to put dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with the wiring diagrams of some kind of passable incinerator. When he turns the machine on, the lights flicker and the dials on his control board tell him the story. The internal Scale shows zero. Mass zero. The temperature gauge shows that there has been no change in centigrade reading that cannot be explained by themechanical operation of the machine itself.

He knew the government wouldn\u2019t be interested in his device because he cannot explain how his device works, and he shrewdly judged that Tony Carmen would not ask an embarrassing question when he is incapable of understanding the explanation. The story ends with Carmen in his bachelor apartment with his late wife, Carmen, and his two young sons. The two talk about how they need to find something in that area of research to help him, and Carmen says that he will call him in a few days. The next day, Carmen receives a call from the D.A.'s office, asking if he can help him dispose of the bodies. The bodies are going to be disposed of somewhere, but Carmen is not sure where they are going. He thinks of it only as a kind of -incinerator. The gadget does not get hot, so how can it burn? It does not use enough electricity to fry them, but it does not cut them up or crush them, or dissolve them in acid. He has seen disappearingcabinets before, so it is easy to imagine that he is working with trap doors or sliding panels. Carmen tries to explain that he has to be dropping the stuff through a sliding panel in order to get the bodies out of the way. The machine is not rigged, so the bodies will be dropped through the sliding panel. He tries to show them to the authorities, but they are unable to trace them back to him because he is the scientist. He decides to take the bodies to the morgue, where he will dispose of them.",
    "The story begins with a small young man, named Martin Isherwood, sitting in the living room of his home with his father, Howard, and his mother, talking about his desire to be a rocket pilot. His father tells him that he can\u2019t afford to send him to college, so he has to learn a trade. The two go to a bar to get some beer, where the advisor, not much older than the small man, shrugs and says that he is not impressed with his son\u2019s desire. The small man leaves the bar and goes to the porch, where he tells his father that he has a trade, which his father does not approve of. When he gets down the porch steps, his mother calls out to him, but he ignores her. He goes back to the house, where his father is waiting for him. He tells him to come back, and the two go out to get more beer. When they get back, the little man tells his mother that he wants to go to the moon. His mother worries about him, and he tells her that there are no rockets on the moon, which makes his father angry. The story then moves to the beginning of the next week, when the young man signs up for Astronomy 101, a course that will prepare him for the mission. His advisor, Dave, tries to convince him to stay in the program, but the boy is not interested. He decides to go on a deep dive into the Everglades with his ship, Navion. The air is very hot, and it is very difficult for him to breathe. He is sweating profusely, and when he reaches the end of the walk, his father yells at him to stop and come back. The little man stops at the bottom of the steps, and turns around to see his mother and grandmother, who are standing in the kitchen. The grandmother is worried about her husband, and she tells her husband to stop acting like a child and talk to him. The father tells her to stop calling him \u201cHoward\u201d, and then the story ends.",
    "Nan is the wife of Howard Isherwood, the small man who wants to pilot the first manned rocket to the moon. She is a pretty brunette with short hair and wears a housedress. She tries to talk to her husband about her husband\u2019s desire to be a rocket pilot, but he is not interested in learning anything other than math and engineering. She also tries to convince him to sell the Foo and go into some kind of other kind of business. She does not want to get married because she is dead broke, a widow, and with a funeral to pay for. The only smart thing to do is to wait a while. When she finds out that her husband is not going to win the Vandenberg Cup next week, she tells him that he can\u2019t get married. She tells him to take a breather, and he tells her that everything he owns is tied up in the Foo, his ground crew, his trailer, and that scrummy old Ryan that should have been salvaged ten years ago. She asks him why he cannot just sell it and become a pilot. He says that he cannot afford to do that, so he has to stay with the Foo for the time being. She says that if he does, he will be rich, and she will be able to afford to buy a house. She then asks him to marry her if he wants to. He refuses, and they go to the bar to get some beer. When they get there, the bartender reminds them that the air in the bar is air conditioned, and the bartender tells them that they need to go get some more beer. The two leave the bar, and when they get back to the Navion, the air is even hotter. The air is so hot that it burns the hair on the back of the mangrove where they landed. They go to get more air, and as they get closer to the ship, they realize that they are in the Everglades. They stop at the bank of a stream, where they see a group of kids playing in the water. They realize that the kids are playing with each other, and one of them is a boy named Marty. The other one is named Ishay, and his name is Martin. He is the son of Howard, a small, red-faced man who does not like the fact that his son wants to be rocket pilot. The story ends with the two of them sitting on the porch of the house.",
    "Martin Isherwood is the son of Howard, a small, red-faced man, and his wife, a brunette girl. He is a rocket pilot, and he has one ambition, one desire: to pilot the first manned rocket to the moon. His father is annoyed that he can\u2019t afford to send him to college, so he tells him that he has to learn a trade. The advisor, not much older than his son, shrugs, defeated, and goes to get some beer. The bar is air conditioned, and the advisor shivers, half-grins, and softens when he quotes: Though I go bare, take no care, I am nothing a-cold; I stuff my skin so full within of jolly good ale and old. Huh? Ish was wearing the look with which he always reacted to the unfamiliar. He gets down the porch stairs and walks out of the house, hesitating a little, as his father\u2019s shout follows him. He stops at the end of the walk and turns off into the street. He tells his father to stop talking to him, and tells his mother that he is going to go back to his job. His mother worries about him, but he tells her that there is nothing to worry about. The Navion takes a boiling thermal under its right wing and buckles suddenly, tilts at the same time, so that the pretty brunettegirl in the other half of the side-by-side is thrown against him. Ish laughs, a sound that came out of his throat as turbulently as the sudden gust of heated air, and corrects with a tilt of the wheel. Relax, Nan, he says, his words colored by the lingering laughter. The girl pats her short hair back into place. Low? Call this low? Ish teased. He nudges the wheel forward and the Navion dips its nose in a shallow dive, flattening out thirty feet above the mangrove. The swamp howls with the chug of the dancing pistons and the claw of the propeller at the top of the air. His face lost allexpression. Faint beads of sweat broke out above his eyes and under his nose. His fists locked on the wheel, and suddenly, the ship breaks through the cloud. Up, he grabs onto the spinner of the ship, and it goes up at a rapid rate of speed. He pulls the wheel back, targeting a cumulous bank with his spinner. His lips peel back from his teeth and his jaw set as the ship's engine turns over as fast as it can, her wings cushioned on the rising thrust of another thermal. And, suddenly, it is as if there are no girl beside him, to be teased, and there is no air to rock the wings. He grates through his clenched teeth. The ship goes up again, and when it does, it does so with the help of the rumble of a louder, prouder engine than the Earth has ever known. He sighs, the sound of a spaceship's engines filling the Everglades. He turns and looks at the white-faced girl, her fingertips trembling on his forearm. Sorry, he told the girl, Everything I own is tied up in the Foo, my ground crew, my trailer, and that scrummy old Ryan that should have been salvaged tenyears ago. I can't get married. Suppose I crack the Foo next week? The only smart thing to do is wait a while. Nan's eyes clouded, and her lips trembled. That's what I've been trying to say. Why can't you sell the Foo and go into some kind of a career. Why do you have to win the Vandenberg Cup next week. I'm signed up for Astronomy 101. A snap course. A breather, after you've studied the same stuff in Celestial Navigation. And that Astronronomy course isn't a breather.",

The advisor lifts two fingers to the bartender and shrugs; he is about four hundred years old, as a matter of fact. The boy gets down the porch stairs and runs out of the house to the porch. He stops at the end of the walk and turns off into the street, his father\u2019s shout following him. He yells at him to come back, but he is too far away from the house. He goes back and tells his father that he is not interested in working for a degree, and that the program is just like the others he has followed for ninesemesters: nothing but math and engineering. The teacher, however, is not convinced, and asks him to either deliver or get off the basket. The young man decides to stay in the program and study for the Astronomy 101 course, which he is signed up for. After a few days of studying, he tells his wife that he wants to go back to his rocket pilot job. He gets a call from his mother, who is worried about him, and they go to see him. When they get to the ship, he is greeted by a beautiful brunette girl named Nan, who tells him she wishes he would not fly the ship so low. She explains to him that she is a widow, and she cannot get married because of the cost of maintaining the Foo. She asks him why he can't just sell the Foo and go into some kind of a career.

    "The words that other people say about the rocket are the most important part of the story. They are the ones that inspire the young man to take the job of piloting the first manned rocket to the moon. These words are the reason why he decides to abandon his dream of becoming a rocket pilot and become a mechanic. The words of other people make him realize that his dreams are not as important as he thinks they are. They also make him question why he wants to be a pilot in the first place, and why he is willing to risk his life to achieve his dream. In the end, it is the words of the other people that inspire him to give up everything he has and go into some kind of a dangerous profession.",
    "Farrell, the navigator, and Stryker, the captain, and Gibson, the engineer, and linguist, are on a mission to Alphard Six, a planet that was colonized by the Hymenops a hundred years ago. They are on their way to find colonies that have been abandoned by the Bees, who have been gone for over a century. The mission is to find Terrans colonies that were enslaved and abandoned by them, and to find a valuable Reclamations ship that is too close to the planet for them to land on it. The crew of the ship, the Marco Four, has landed on Alphard six, and they are on the verge of a confrontation with the Hive, an alien race that invaded Alphard in the past. The story begins with the crew discussing the situation, and how they should proceed with their mission. Farrell, the Navigator, is the most impulsive of the crew, and he decides to go ahead with the mission, even though Strykers, the Captain, does not approve. He argues that Alphard is not an unreclaimed world, and that the Bees never settled there, so there is no reason to settle there. He also argues that there is not enough time for any subjugated culture to climb from slavery to interstellar flight. The ship is on rest leave at the moment, and the mission is still to find Terran colonies that are no longer occupied by the Bee, so it is not worth risking their lives to explore the planet. The Navigator and the two other crew members, Henearly and Farrell, disagree about the best course of action to take, and it is decided that the ship should go into orbit around Alphard and search for a suitable planet for the mission. The plan is to use the Ringwave energy fields of Alphard to locate the colonies that the Bee have left behind, and then to destroy them. They decide to use a ship called the ZIT, which is a computer that monitors the ship\u2019s movements and allows them to reset the ship to its original orbit. The ZIT computer is controlled by a control group called the Control Group. The control group is made up of the Navigators, the engineers, the linguists, and a number of other people. The goal of the group is to determine who the aliens are and why they have left Alphard, and who they are trying to control. The Colony of the Bees has been gone from Alphard for a century and a half, and there are no colonies left on the planet, so they cannot be the aliens. The command center is located in the control room, where the Captain and the other members of the control group discuss the situation. The Command Center is located on the surface of the planet Alphard.",
    "Farrell is the navigator of the three-man Terran Reclamations crew on Alphard Six. He is the youngest and most impulsive of the crew, and he is the one who initiates the first reconnaissance of the planet. He has a reputation for being impulsive and impulsive, and it shows throughout the story. He orders Stryker, the ship\u2019s captain, to search the planet for any colonies that might be on the planet, even though the Colony of the Bees have been gone for over a hundred years. He also orders the linguist, Gibson, to play chess with his colleague, the engineer, and the biologist, Xavier, to help him figure out who the aliens are and why they\u2019re there. When Farrell refuses to be baited, he turns to Gibson, who is busily assessing the damage done to the ship by the explosion of the ZIT computer, and tells him that he\u2019ll fix it in a matter of hours. He then goes to the control room to discuss the situation with the ship's other navigator, Henearly, and his friend, Farrell. When he returns, he tells them that the ship is too close to Alphard, and they need to find a reconnaissancespiral, which means that they have to go there first. He offers to go with them, but they refuse because they need the computer first. When they arrive, they find the planet Alphard six, which is described as a jewel of a world. They find it to be uninhabitable because it was never colonized before the Hymenops\u2019 invasion in 3025, and there is no way for the Bees to have settled there. They decide to explore the planet and find out more about the aliens, and when they do, they discover that they are not aliens, but rather the descendants of the first colonizers, the Bees, who left the planet in the year 3000 and never came back. They discover that Alphard is inhabited by humans, but the humans are not the same as the ones that colonized Alphard. They realize that they must find a way to destroy the aliens because they are the only way to get them out of this situation. They send the ship into orbit around Alphard in order to find them, and Farrell is the only one who is brave enough to take on the challenge.",
    "Stryker is the captain of the three-man Terran Reclamations crew on Alphard Six. He is a tall, handsome man in his late thirties. He has long, gray hair and a paunchy, fat paunch that makes him look like a fat, good-humored man. He looks down on Farrell, the navigator, and Gibson, the engineer, and linguist. Stryker has a reputation for being very impulsive, but he is also very intelligent, as he is able to figure out a way to fix the ZIT computer in a matter of hours. He also has a keen eye for detail, as evidenced by the fact that he is the first to inspect the damage to the ship after the explosion. He does not like to be left behind, and he is very determined to find the truth about the situation.",
    "The story takes place on Alphard Six, a planet that was colonized by the Hymenops around the year 3000. The planet was one of the first system that the Bees took over. Alphard is a dun-colored moon that is located in the orbit of Alphard six. It is described to be very arid and sparsely populated. There are three emptydomes on Five, which is a desert planet, and there are no more than a dozen on Alpharad six. There is also no way for the Bees to settle Alphard, so they never settled there. Stryker, the captain of the ship, argues that Alphard was never colonized before the Bees\u2019 invasion, so there\u2019s no reason for them to settle there now. The ship is two hundred twenty-six light-years from Sol, the old limits of Terran expansion, and it is too close to Alphard to land on an unobserved planet. The Bees have been gone for over a hundred years, so Colonists might have migrated from another Terran-occupied planet. They can\u2019t be the ones that colonized Alphard because they never had a colony at the beginning of the story. The story also takes place in the control room, where the captain and the navigator, Farrell, and the engineer, Gibson, are arguing about the best way to investigate Alphard. The control room has a screen that shows the location of the ZIT computer that controls the ship. The computer is located on the planet, but it is not visible from the ship because it is hidden in a large room. The room is equipped with a computer that allows the ship to communicate with the ship via radio.",
    "The Ringwave technology is the only way that humans have been able to travel beyond the old sphere of Terran exploration. It is the answer to long-range travel. The Ringwave energy fields are the only answer to interstellar travel, and if they did not have that, they wouldn't have bothered with atomic weapons. Stryker and the other crew members of the Reclamations ship believe that the Hymenops, a race that invaded Alphard six hundred years ago, never colonized the planet. They have been gone for over a hundred years, so there is no way for them to have migrated from another Terran-occupied planet. Therefore, they cannot be the descendants of the Bees, who left the planet in 3025. The Colony of Alphard Six was surveyed and seeded with Terran bacteria around the year 3000, but the Bees invaded before they could colonize it. Alphard's was one of the first system the Bees took over, and it must have been abandoned when they pulled back to 70 Ophiuchi. The Bees have since moved on to other planets, and there's no way that they can be the ones who abandoned Alphard. The only way to find them is through the Ringwave, which is why the crew is on a mission to find Terran colonies enslaved and abandoned by the Bees. The goal of the mission is to find colonies that have not been colonized by them, and to find a way to bring them back to the planet so that they will be able to destroy them.",
    "The story begins with Jon Karyl, a Lone Watcher, on an asteroid. He is preparing to put in a new baffleplate on the stationary rocket engine. He does not see the strange spaceship that lands on the asteroid, but he hears strange noises from the station upstairs. He goes upstairs to look at the televisor that is fixed on the area around the station. He sees the steel-blue creatures that are coming toward the station, but they are coming too fast for him. He runs down the hill to escape them, but the strangers catch him unawares. When he turns his head, a Steel-Blue is facing him, holding a square black box with a lens on the back of its head. The creature has no lips on its face, and its eyes are covered by an elliptical-shaped lens that curves around the sides of the head. He asks the creature who it is, and the creature responds telepathically in the language of the Steel-Blues. He follows the creature to the service station, where he finds a lock leading to the station\u2019s power plant. He turns on the television in the control room, and he sees the two steel-blues crawling out of the ship. They have no legs, just appendages that stretch and shrink independent of the other, and their cylindrical body with four pair of tentacles on a level balance. Jon follows them through the sunderedlock of the station to examine the wreckage of the rocket engine, which has been punched full of holes as if it had been some soft cheese instead of ametal, which Earthmen had spent nearly a century perfecting. The two creatures are surprised that metal is found on their world, and they compliment him on the fact that it is probably the softest and mostmalleable metal they have. Jon goes to inspect the wreckage, and when he sees a piece of metal that drips off the ship, he realizes that the ship has changed, and it is no longer a ship of the solar system, but a rocket of the planet Sun. Jon is dumbfounded when he hears a loud crack and sees the bolts from the ship ricochet off of it, and realizes that they must have been fired by the atomic cannon on the station cannon. He presses the red button again, and suddenly he is on the floor of the power room, his legs suddenly cut out from under him, and his arms seem flaccid. He tries to pull himself to an upright position, but it is impossible. He realizes that he is paralyzed from the waist down, and turns to the side, and a man-like creature with round-headed metal club-like appendages is standing behind him. Jon realizes that this is a robot named Steel-Bluewas telepathic. The robot is telepathic, and Jon asks the robot what it is and the robot answers. The Robot tells him that they are from the Solar System, and that they can be friends. Jon decides to follow the robot, and after a few minutes, the robot tells him to shut the lock on the door, and then the door closes. Jon runs back to the command center, where the robot says that they will stay for a long time. When Jon goes inside, he sees that the robot has a gun pointed at him, so he quickly shuts the door and runs outside. He hears the robot's voice again, but this time it is the voice of an Earthman, who tells Jon to shut off the oxygen in his suit.",

    "A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be ashining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed by Time\u2019s relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his absence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly-human story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told with no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you. The story begins with a man named Hogey Parker, a spaceman, stumbling out of a bus on his way back to his home. He has not seen Earth for a long time, and the driver warns him to stay out of the road, but he refuses. The driver stops the bus and warns him against any further display, but Hogey still refuses. He is supposed to be back a week ago, and nobody knows he is coming. He sits down hard in the aisle of the bus, and two men help him to the back seat, dumping him on the rear seat, and tucked hisgin bottle safely out of sight. After all, he had not seen earth for ninemonths, and judging by the crusted matter about his eyelids, he cannot see it too well now, even if he had been sober. When the bus starts again, he falls on his side and lay still for a time, then rests, snoring softly. The bus driver wakes him again at Caine's junction, retrieves his gin bottle from behind the seat and helps him down the aisle, and they take him to his house. He wakes up in a ditch, where he crawls up the embankment with mud-soaked knees, and sits on the shoulder again. The gin bottle is still intact, and he has himself along fiery drink. The sun is almost down, forge-red on a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked sky fades into sulphurous yellow toward the zenith. The land is filled with yellow smoke and the air is full of yellow smoke. A farm truck turns onto the side-road and moans away, its driver hardly glancing at the dark young man who sits swaying on hisduffle bag near the culvert. He just keeps staring at the crazy sun. He hates it for what he knows it is behind the gory mask, and for what it has done to his eyes. He gets to his feet, manages to shoulder his duffle bag, and starts down the middle of the farm road, lurching from sideto side, and keeping his eyes on the rolling distances. Another car turns on the side road, honking angrily, and Hogey tries to turn around to look at it, but forgets to shift his foot. He staggered and goes down on the pavement, and a big man with a florid face gets out and talks to him, looking angry. The burly farmer retrieved his bottle for him, still miraculously unbroken. Hogey gets up doggedly, shaking his head to clear it. The farmer tells him that he needs to go home pronto. The man offers to take him home, but the young man refuses, saying that he has space legs. He needs to get another job, so he should stick with his family. The other man offers him a gin bottle for his drink, and when he refuses again, the man hands it to him. He goes back to sleep. The next morning, he wakes up with a hangover. He tries to go back to the house, but his legs won\u2019t work right. The two men come out of their seats to help him. They get him on his feet and take him back to bed. He crawls back down the hill. The girl, who sat nervously staring at him, smiles wanly, and shakes her head. He crashes in affectionately, crashing in the seat beside her. He apologizes to her, crashing into the seat next to her. The men slide out of his seat and a hand clamps his shoulder. He says that he is back up theaisle and apologizes. The woman slides out of her seat.",
    "Hogey\u2019s feet are stuck in concrete because he is a spaceman who has been away from Earth for so long that he is no longer used to the gravity of gravity. When he returns to Earth, his feet become stuck in the concrete. This is significant because he has not seen it in such a long time that he cannot adjust to it. This causes him to have trouble with gravity, which is why the driver stops the bus and warns him to stay out of the road. The driver also warns him not to get too far from the bus because he could get himself killed. Hogey realizes that his feet are attached to the concrete because his mother is half-Cherokee and his father is Cherokee. This means that he has been gone from home for a while, and his feet have become very sensitive to gravity. This makes it very difficult for him to adapt to it, and it also makes it difficult for his family to accept him as a member of the family.",
    "The other humans (hoofers) help Hogey get home because he has not seen Earth for so long that he is no longer used to the gravity of gravity. He is not used to being a tumbler either, so he has lost a lot of weight. He has space legs, and he cannot stand the gravity. The other humans help him because he needs to get home to his wife and kids. They all know he is a spacer because of the white goggle marks on his sun-scorched face, and they all tolerate him and help him. They even make allowances for him when he staggered and falls in the aisle of the bus while pursuing the harassed little housewife from seatto seat and cajoling her to sit and talk with him. When the bus driver stops him and warns him to stay out of the road, the driver stops the bus and goes back to warn him against any further display. They get him on his feet and lead him stumbling back to the aisle. They got him to the back seat and dump him on the rear seat, and tucked his gin bottle safely out of sight. After all, he is supposed to be back from Big Bottomless. He cupped his hands to his mouth and favored them with ablood-curdling proof of his ancestry, and the female passengers comforted him. The driver stopped the bus, warned him not to make any trouble, and told him to sit there by the culvert until he gets a ride. Moments later, the bus pulls away, and Hogey sits down hard in the grass at the shoulder of the highway. He wakes up again at Caine\u2019s junction three miles from his house. He tries to sleep on the side road, but the driver wakes him up and tells him to go have a drink. He gets to the side-road, and another car turns onto it, honking angrily. Hogey tries to turn around to look at it, but he forgets to shift his foot, and goes down on the pavement. The car screeches on the hot asphalt, and a big man with a florid face gets out and tells Hogey that he has aloads. The burly farmer hands him a gin bottle for him, and then tells him that he better get home pronto because his gravity is broken. The farmer explains that his wife is going to be sore, and his son is a little baby pigeon of a son. When Hogey asks for a ride home, the burly man says that he should stick with his family, and that he ought to get another job. The two men help him back to his house, where he falls asleep on the shoulder and wakes up the next morning. The story ends with Hogey in the arms of his son.",
    "A tumbler is a person who has been on Earth for a long amount of time and is not used to the gravity of gravity. A hoofer, on the other hand, is someone who is new to Earth and is used to it. They are used to being on Earth and have not experienced gravity. The difference between the two is that Hogey is a spaceman, a person that has been away from home for a while, and hoofer is someone that has only been gone for a few days or a week. The two are very different in terms of how they interact with each other. The first part of the story takes place on a school bus, where a young man named Hogey Parker gets into a fight with a bus driver. The driver stops the bus and warns him to stay out of the road, and the two walk back to the bus. After a few minutes, Hogey wakes up in the aisle of the bus, which is three miles from his house. He is supposed to be there a week ago, but nobody knows he is coming. The bus driver stops him and tells him to sit there by the culvert until he gets a ride. After the bus driver leaves, he sits down hard in the grass at the shoulder of the highway. A farm truck turns onto the side road and moans at the dark young man who sits swaying on hisduffle bag near a culvert. He just keeps staring at the crazy sun. He hates it for what he knows it is behind the gory mask, and for what it has done to his eyes. Another car turns on the side-road, and Hogey tries to turn around to look at it, but he forgets to shift his foot. The car screeches on the hot asphalt, and a big man with a florid face gets out and tells Hogey that he better get home pronto. The burly farmer retrieves his gin bottle for him, still miraculously unbroken. The farmer tells him that he needs to get back to his house pronto, because he has two kids, both girls. Hogey gets up doggedly, shaking his head to clear it. Space legs, he thinks, can't stand the gravity, the burly man tells him. The man offers him a gin bottle, but Hogey refuses, saying that he has to get home. He goes back to sleep, and when he wakes up again, he is in the middle of a road with a drunk driver, who warns him not to get in the car with the drunk driver again. The drunk driver is a constable, and he warns Hogey to stay off the road. The story ends with Hogey in a hospital, where he is being treated for a severe case of agoraphobia.",
    "The story takes place in the Great Plains of the United States. The main setting of the story is in the early 20th century. The story begins with a man named Hogey Parker, or Chief Broken Wing, sitting in a bus on his way to his wife\u2019s house. He has not seen Earth for a long time, and the driver warns him to stay out of the road because it is dangerous for him. The driver stops the bus and warns him against any further display, but Hogey refuses. The two men help him to the back of the bus, dump him on the rear seat, and take him to sleep in the aisle. When the bus starts again, he lies on his side and retches for a time, then rests, snoring softly. The bus driver wakes him again at Caine's junction, retrieves his gin bottle from behind the seat, helps him down the aisle, and takes him out to the side road. He sits down hard in the gravel at the shoulder of the highway, then sits down again on the shoulder. A farm truck turns onto the side-road and moans away, its driver hardly glancing at the dark young man who sits swaying on hisduffle bag near the culvert. He just keeps staring at the crazy sun. The sun, the real sun, is a hateful eye-sizzling horror, it painted everything with pure white pain, and it doesn\u2019t fool him any. He hated it for what he knew it was behind the gory mask, and for what it had done to his eyes. With a grunt, he gets to his feet, manages to shoulder his duffle bag, and starts off down the middle of the farm road, lurching from side to side, and keeping his eyes on the rolling distances. Another car turns on the road, honking angrily, and Hogey tries to turn around to look at it, but he forgets to shift his foot. The car screeches, and a big man with a florid face gets out and talks to him, looking angry. The burly farmer retrieves a bottle for him, still miraculously unbroken, and tells him that he needs to get home pronto. Hogey gets up doggedly, shaking his head to clear it. The farmer gives him a gin bottle for his drink, and he goes back to his house. After a while, the two men come back to pick him up, and they take him back to the bus. They get him on his feet and lead him stumbling back to their house. The bottom of the ditch is wet and he crawls up the embankment with mud-soaked knees. The gin bottle is still intact, so he sits on his shoulder again. He had himself along fiery drink and it warmed him deep down. He blinked around the gaunt and treeless land; the sun was almost down, forge-red on a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked sky faded into sulphurous yellow toward the zenith; the air was tinted yellow and the land seemed full of yellow smoke. The land was treeless, barren, and dusty. There was not even a store at the road junction; only a freight building next to the railroad track, a couple of farmhouses at the edge of a side road; and, just across the way, a deserted farmhouse with a sagging, filling station. There is a desertedfilling station; the land was Great Plains country, treeless and barren; and it was almost dusk when the story ended.",
    "Ed Loyce, the owner of LOYCE TV SALES ANDSERVICE, sees a body hanging from a lamppost in the center of the town square. The body hangs there for a very long time, and no one seems to notice it. Ed thinks that there must be a good reason, or it wouldn\u2019t be there. The police car is getting near the town\u2019s Hall of Justice, and the two cops say that there is no need to arrest Ed because he should be back at his store. Ed explains that he was down in the basement, digging a new foundation for his TV set, when he saw the body hanging there. He thinks that it has been there for so long that no one should have noticed it. The two cops also say that they have no idea why the body is there, but Ed insists that it is there because he saw it this afternoon when he went out for coffee. Ed goes back to his store, where he meets Jack Potter from the shoe shop, who tells him that the body has been hanging there all afternoon. Ed realizes that he missed the explanation of the body because he was at home, digging, and his wife and kids were at school. Ed calls the police, but they have nothing to do with it, so he goes to the library to find out more information about the body. When he returns to the store, he sees that the police have not filed a report, and he thinks that they must have forgotten to do so. He goes to see Don Fergusson, an old man who owns the hardware store next to the TV store, and asks him to call the police. Don says that he has nothing to report because he is busy with his own business, so Ed goes to his house to get a doctor. Ed sees the body of a man hanging from the same post as the body hangs in the square. He wonders how long the body had been there, and why no one noticed it, but the police say that it was there all day. Ed decides to go to the police and ask them what happened, but he is interrupted by a call from his wife, who says that her husband is not feeling well. Ed tells her that he is sick, and she tells him to go see the doctor. When Ed goes outside to see the body, he finds it hanging in the middle of the street with a shapeless dark bundle hanging from it. It is a human body. Ed wonders how the body could have been there so long, and when he sees the police car approaching, he realizes that it must have been hanging for a long time. He tells the police that he cannot leave the body there, so they take him to the hospital to get it checked out. Ed asks the doctor for a check-up, but it turns out that he does not have a fever, so the doctor says that it cannot be the cause of death. Ed is then taken to the morgue to get the body autopsied. When the doctor arrives, he discovers that the person who left the body on the street was a stranger, a middle-aged man named Aman, and that he had been murdered. The stranger had a graysuit on, and it was covered in mud and blood. The doctor tells Ed that he will be sent to the state medical examiner to get an exact cause for the death, and then the body will be handed over to the proper authorities.",

    "The alien flies are small, slender creatures with red hair, blue eyes, and blue eyes. They have long, sharp fangs. Their bodies are covered in dirt and blood. They are small and slender, and their bodies are dirty and covered in grime. Loyce describes them as being about the size of a small child\u2019s dollhouse. They do not seem to be able to stand up to the heat, but they do have the ability to adapt to different environments.

    "The story takes place in the town of Pikeville, in the United States. The first part of the story is set in Ed Loyce\u2019s store, located at 1368 Hurst Road. There is a small square of green in the center of the street, the town park, and there is a single lamppost with a shapeless dark bundle hanging from it. There are no parking places in front of the store, so Ed makes a U-turn and goes to the town square, passing the little square with its lonely drinking fountain and bench. The police car is getting near the Hall of Justice, and the sun is getting low in the sky. The streets are gloomy and dark, and it is getting late in the evening. The body hangs from a post in the square and has been there for a long time. Ed sees a body hanging from the post, and he is angry that nobody has noticed it. He makes his way to the curb and crosses out into traffic, among the cars. He sees a crowd of people moving along the sidewalk, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle, and then went on. He passes the park and sees the body hanging there. Ed goes back to his store, where he is met by Jack Potter from the shoe shop, who tells him to call the cops. Ed then goes to see Don Fergusson, the owner of the TV sales store, who asks him to come into the store. The store is open without him, but he is tired, so he stops his car and heads into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES ANDSERVICE.

    "Bruce hears their feet on the gravel outside and gets up reluctantly to open the door for them. He had been reading some of Byron's poems he'd sneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing off, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to bepostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of human beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all, but seemed real and alive. Maybe that was it. He took a deep breath and stood there before the cold nihilistic stares of fourteen eyes. Terrence nodded. He leaned forward. They did a bad psych job on you. They should never have sent you on this trip. I know, Bruce agreed indifferently. Itold them I shouldn't be brought along. I said I didn't want any part of it. Because you're afraid. You're not Conqueror material. That's why you backed down when we all voted to climb the mountain. And what the devildoes Venus\u2014? Max Drexel's freckles slipped into the creases across his highforehead. Haven't you heard him expounding on the injustice done to the Venusian aborigines, Captain? If you haven't, you aren't thoroughly educated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people. I haven't heard it, Terrence admitted. What injustice? Bruce said, I guess it couldn't really be considered an injustice any longer. Values have changed too much. Doran and I were part of the crew of that first ship to hit Venus five years ago. Remember? One of the New Era's more infamous dates. No one ever got a chance to find out. We ran into this village, no one knows how old it was, but there were intelligent beingsthere. One community left on the whole planet, maybe a few thousand inhabitants. They made their last mistake when they came out to greet us. The village was burned and everything alive in it was destroyed. Bruce felt the old weakness coming into his knees, the sweat beginning to run down his face, and he stood there for a long time before the other crew members arrived. He was drafted for this trip because he was not ready for it, but he doesn't want it anymore. He thinks about the strange misty shapes that had come to him in his dreams, the voices that had called to him when he woke from them, and how disappointed he was when he first hit Marseight months ago. He remembered the other four rockets that had never made it back to Earth, all lying side by side under the mountain\u2019s shadow. The mountain seemed to be pointing an accusing finger at Earth, and it seemed to him that it was a warning finger. He looked up at the huge overhang of the mountain, and there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one incredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it had seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing a accusing finger towards Earth. He thought that it might be the reason why the other three ships had not made it to the planet. He felt the cold wind cutting through his hair, and the icy wind cut through his suit. He started climbing into it, and Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger in the special cold-resisting suiting. He invited him in, and Bruce invited him to get warm, and they both stood outside. He climbed into the suit, and when he got warm, he looked at Terrence, who looked astonished. He pulled the weapon out of his holster, pointed it at Bruce, and said they had to get somesleep, and then they were starting up that mountain at five in the morning. He said he would be glad to see them climb it.",
    "The story takes place on the surface of Mars. The crew of the ship, Mars V, is on a mission to conquer the planet. The ship is in the middle of an investigation into the death of a crew member, Lieutenant Doran, who was killed by the crew of a previous ship that landed on Mars five years ago. The story begins in a room on Mars, where the crew is sitting in a semi-circle of seven judges. There is a cold wind blowing through the room, and the two men, Anhauser and Jacobs, stand outside the room. The room has a special cold-resisting suit that Bruce is wearing, and he climbs into it. There are two other men, Terrence, who is in charge of the investigation, and Marsha Rennels, who sits on the extreme right. The rest of the room is covered in a thick layer of ice, and there is a window that looks out over the entire planet. Outside of the window, there is an overhang of the mountain, and it looks as though it is pointing an accusing finger at Earth. The mountain is 45,000 feet in height, which is a lot higher than any mountain on Earth. It is smooth and undulating. The entire face of the planet is smoothed into soft, undulating red hills. And there is one incredible mountain that rises out of barren nothingness. On certain nights, when the stars are right, it seems to Bruce that it can be seen as a warning finger to Earth. He thinks of the other four ships that have come to Mars before, all of which have fallen. The men are on their way to climb the mountain when they are interrupted by Terrence's voice. He tells them that he has been having these dreams ever since they arrived on Mars. In these dreams, people talk to him, there are other things in the dreams that aren't human at all, and some kind of shapes that are not what you would call humans at all. Terrence explains that these dreams are the result of him being on Mars for so long that he is no longer able to distinguish between the human and the non-human forms. He also explains that the humans have established a kind of final totalitarianism since the New Era. The psychologists, the Pavlovian Reflex boys, have done that. If you don't want to be reconditioned to fit into the social machine like a human vacuum tube, you keep your mouth shut, and when the mouth is kept shut long enough, the mind forgets what it had wanted to open the mouth for in the first place. The people on Mars have been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically for centuries, and they cling to old ideas of freedom, democracy, self-determinism, and individualism. To most, the words have no meaning now. It was a question of which set of conquering heroes can conquer the most space first. Venus had done a good, thorough job. They had done the fifth attempt, and their crews had disappeared.",
    "Marsha Rennels is Bruce\u2019s right-hand woman. She is a young woman who has been married to him for a long time, and she does not show any emotion when she is around him. She also does not seem to know what he is thinking or why he is doing the things that he does. She does not know why he killed the man, but she also doesn\u2019t seem to understand why he does it. Marsha does not like the way that Terrence and the other crew members treat her, and they do not treat her well either. They treat her as an object of pity and pity, and it is clear that they are afraid of her. They do not see her as a strong woman, but as a woman who is loyal to her husband. They have a loving relationship, and Marsha is the one who tries to support her husband when he is in trouble. She tries to help him when he needs her, but he does not listen to her. He does not understand why she is afraid of him, and he tries to convince her to stay with him.",
    "The highest mountain in the Solar System is Mount Everest. It is 45,000 feet in height, higher than any other mountain on Earth. The mountain is where the crew of the spaceship that landed on Mars five years ago encountered the Venusians, and where they killed their leader, Lieutenant Doran. Mount Everest is significant because it is the highest point on Mars, and it is where Terrence and the rest of the crew members killed the Venusian crew members. The crew members of the ship, Mars V, are on a mission to conquer the planet, and the mountain is the reason why they are on the mission in the first place. The team of seven judges sits in a semi-circle, and Bruce stands there in the middle of the half-moon of inquisition, with his long legs stretched out and his hands folded on his belly. Captain Terrence sits on the extreme right, and Marsha sits in the extreme left, and Anhauser is on the other side of the circle. Terrence's big, square face frowns a little. Bruce is aware suddenly of the sound of the bleak, never-ending wind against the plastileneshelter. He remembers the strange misty shapes that had come to him in his dreams, the voices that had called to him, and how disappointed he had been when he woke from them. The wind's voice seemed to sharpen and rise to a kind of wail. He has had these dreams ever since they got here. People talk to him there, and there are other things in the dreams that aren't human at all. Voices and some kind of shapes that aren\u2019t what you would call humans at all, and shapes that are not recognizable as humans. He is also aware of the fact that Terrence is a member of the Convincor Corps, and Terrence\u2019s uniform is black, with a silver fist insignia of the Conquestor Corps on his arm. Marsha Rennels, the woman he was supposed to be working with, is sitting in the far right. She has no emotion at all on her trim, neat face. He remembered her as she was years ago, but at the moment he is not looking very hard to see anything on her face. They had gotten her young and it was too late. He thinks about the injustice done to Venusian aborigines, but Terrence admits that it cannot really be considered an injustice any longer because the values of the planet have changed too much. He also talks about how Terrence was part of the first ship to hit Venus, five years prior to the events of the story. The village was burned and everything alive in it was destroyed, and he thinks about how the people of Venus are intelligent and intelligent, but they made a mistake when they came out to greet the ship. The planet is much older, geologically. The entire face of Mars is smoothed into soft, undulating red hills and there is an incredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars are right, it seems to Bruce as though it is pointing an accusing finger at Earth, or a warning one.",
    "Toward the end of the story, Terrence wakes up from his dream in which he is on the top of the highest mountain in the Solar System with Bruce. Terrence explains that he killed Lieutenant Doran because he didn\u2019t like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing him, and when he shot him, the wind\u2019s voice seemed to sharpen and rise to a kind of wail. He then goes on to explain that he has been having these dreams ever since they arrived on Mars. They are strange dreams in which people talk to him and there are other things in the dreams that are not what you would call human at all. There is also a voice that seems to be speaking to him, but it is not the voice of the human race. There are also shapes that look like human shapes, and some kind of shapes that do not resemble humans at all, such as trees, rocks, and other things. The voice also tells Terrence that he will be sent back to Earth when they get back. When he wakes up, he is in a room with Marsha, and she tells him that she has a message for him. She explains to him that he is supposed to be working on a geological job with her, but he has forgotten about it. She then tells him about the strange things that have been happening to him in his dreams, and how he is no longer the same person he was when they left Earth. He also tells her that he wants to make a statement when they return to Earth, but Terrence says that it is a mere formality, and that he does not want to go on the record, so he will do it when the time comes. He goes to bed, and the next morning, he meets with Terrence and the rest of the crew on the ship. He tells them that he shot the lieutenant because he did not like the nonsense that he was giving them, and they all know that he did it because he was tired of being told what to do by the other crew members. He is then taken to the control room, where he is met by Terrence, who tells him to shut the hell up. Then, he goes to the command center, and Terrence orders him to be put in charge of the investigation into the death of the lieutenant. He explains to Terrence why he killed the lieutenant, and then they go to bed.",
    "Roddie is a young man who lives in the city of Golden Gate with his nurse, Molly, and his best friend, Molly. Molly is a nurse, and she has taught him how to carry out every purpose. Roddie has been left behind with Molly while the soldiers go out to fight. He is angry because he has never seen an Invader, and he is full-grown and has never even seen an invader. Molly tells him that the soldiers don\u2019t want little boys, so he tries to convince them that he is not a little boy. He tries to fix the broken-handled screwdriver he has, but the soldiers come in and cover him with carbon dioxide foam. He then tries to make a whole one, but it is too much for his left arm to handle. He decides to hide in a manhole, dead center in the dead street. Aweathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover\u2019s slotted rim, is the levering key that opens its door. He cannot even find the bar, because the bar is a roller on which tomove the heavy cover from below, and a support that holds it ajar for ventilation. But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carryout every purpose, Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite allobstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against anything larger than a rat. The firefighter put even him out when he was aflame, and the soldier who tried to save him fell into the fire. The soldier collapsed to the floor. He salvaged the bar and returned it to the cover, tearing him apart as a boy dismembers an alarm clock. The left arm's pair of hands suddenly writhed off the floor in an effort to choke him. But because the arm was detached at the shoulder and therefore blind, he escaped the clutching onslaught and could goad the reflexing hands into assaulting one another. Meanwhile, the other soldiers left, except for one, apparently another Casualty, who stumbled on his way out and fell into fire. To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire, but there is only blackness. He sneers at what could have entered the iron cover, and thinks about how much of a shame it is to be different from his friends. Molly reminds him that hunger, thirst, pain, and cold are sensations never experienced by his friends; he decides to do his best to hide as far as possible from the eyes of the soldiers. He gives the fire a final poke and then pauses, wondering if he can make an unfastened end of wire stick on the grayish spot where it seemed to belong. Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he can try out his new idea, he gets too close to the flames. His left arm is detached from the shoulder, but he is able to use his screwdriver to fix it. Molly steps in front of him and tries to comfort him, but his treatment only starts something worse. He grabs her head off her neck, and angrily screams, \u201cWuzzums hungry? Molly cooed, still rocking.\u201d He realizes that Molly is not being very nice to his baby, and thrusts her knitted needles into his eyes. Molly explains that she is a bomb, but this only started something worse: hunger, pain and cold were sensations that he had never experienced before. He tells her to stop, and suddenly, she screams again. He kills her, and Molly cries. The invaders break in from the north, and there are eleven of them, six feet tall, with four limbs and eight extra-extremities. They stand uniformly, the thumbs on each pair of handstouching along the center line of the legs, front feet turned out at an angle of forty-five degrees, and rear feet turned inward at thirty degrees. He inspects the injured soldier, and they choruses that they have met the enemy, and one of them is ours.",
    "Ida is the nurse of Roddie. She is a young woman who cares for him while he is away from home. She has taught him the alphabet and the meaning of love. She also taught him how to use a screwdriver to make a wire stick on the gray spot where it seemed to belong. When the Invaders attack the city, she tries to protect him with her knitted-in-her-nurse manner, but he refuses to listen to her. Molly is a nurse as well, so she knows how to keep him warm, but she is unable to comfort him when he is cold or hungry. When he is hurt, she helps him with his broken-handled screwdriver, and she also helps him make a new wire to attach to the bar that opens the door of the manhole so that he can escape the invaders. She does not want to fight with the Invaders, and when she sees the invaders, she cries and begs for them to leave the city.",
    "Roddie and Molly have a very good relationship. She is a nurse who raised him despite all the obstacles she had to deal with. She cares for him and tries to comfort him when he is sad or angry. She also tries to help him as much as she can. When the Invaders attack the city, she tries to protect him with her knitting needles, but he is not having it. He is angry at her for not being able to do more for him, and he wants to fight for his friends. They have a loving relationship, and it is clear from the beginning of the story that they care for each other deeply. However, as the story continues, it becomes clearer and clearer that their relationship is not as warm and caring as it used to be.",
    "Roddie uses his tools (screwdriver and hammer) throughout the story to make his way through the ruins of the city to his hiding place. He first uses his screwdriver to try to fix the broken-handled screwdriver that Molly had given him when he was a child, and then he uses a levering key to open the door of the manhole cover. He also uses a knife to cut through the metal of the bar that holds the lid of the cover. Finally, he uses his ax to break the lock of the barrel of the gun that keeps the soldiers safe.",
    "Roddie is different from his friends because he has been raised by a nurse, Molly, who has taught him how to carry out every purpose. Molly is a nurse and has raised him despite all the obstacles she has encountered. She is also the one who raised him in a fight with the Invaders twenty years ago. Molly also tells him that the soldiers don\u2019t want little boys because they are not interested in them. This makes Roddie angry because he is not a little boy, he is full-grown and has never seen an invader before. He is angry because the soldiers do not want him, and he does not understand why they do not see him as a member of their own. He tries to find a way to escape from them, but Molly refuses to let him go. He realizes that he is different because his friends have never experienced hunger, thirst, pain, and cold. These are sensations never experienced by his friends. He also realizes that the Invaders are not his enemies, they are the ones who are trying to destroy the city. When the Invaders break in from the north, he has developed a hideout toward which he now walks. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of how much he differed from the rest of his friends had been a shock, and the shock itself was itself a difference to be hidden. His hiding place is a manhole, dead center in the dead street. Aweathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, is the levering key that opens its door. Everything is wrong tonight! He cannot even find the bar. Of course that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which tomove the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for ventilation. Molly was a nurse; she had taught him above all else to carryout every purpose, and she was a guard. The soldiers are guards, and they protect the ruins against anything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even him out when he was aflame. The other soldiers left, except for one, apparently another Casualty, who stumbled on his way out and fell into the fire. He decides to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces of the other to make a whole one. To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire, but there is nothing. He sneers at the idea of entering through the iron cover. When he tries to fix the bar, there is only blackness. He hears the words \u201cdeath to invaders\u201d being shouted by one of the soldiers. The soldier takes a step forward, stops, and yells \u201cDeath to Invaders!\u201d and charges, and Molly steps in front of him. Molly then steps in to save him. He takes the soldier\u2019s helmet, knocks off his helmet, and presses a softspot on his conical skull. He gives the soldier a screwdriver to try and fix the problem, but the soldier collapses to the floor. Molly saves the soldier, and when the other soldiers come in, they cover him with carbon dioxide foam.",
    "Celeste Wolver looks up at the book her friend Madge Carnap holds aloft like a torch. She made out the title, The Dance of the Planets, which is an old book from the Twentieth Century aged to a particularly nasty shade of brown. There is no mistaking the time of its origin. Theodor and Theodor are bound on business connected with the disappearance of the planets Phobos and Deimos. They go to a meeting of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes to see if any of it correlates with this bit of astronomicals light-of-hand. Madge explains that they are going to present the evidence at the meeting. Celeste explains that her husband Theodor is the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this might happen, and she is never a Kometevskyite before. She said it almost apologetically, standing there so frank and anxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic. She explains that there are several more convincing alternate explanations, such as the Disrupted Space Hypothesis, but Theodor hesitates, knowing that there isn\u2019t one. He goes on to explain that the two tiny moons of Mars have disappeared during a period when the eyes of astronomy are not on them. Mars\u2019 two moons are described as \u201cvanished\u201d during a time when no one is paying attention to them. They are described to be a few miles in diameter, and are smaller than many of the asteroids. Theodortold her warmly, but she cannot make it sound funny. Jupiter was supposed to have started as the outermost planet, and is to end up in the orbit of Mercury, Theodor continued. Well, nothingat all like that has happened, but it\u2019s begun. Phobos has appeared, and you can't argue away that stubborn little fact; you cannot argue away the fact that Mars is no longer an inhabited planet. He also explains that the planet Phobos is now in orbit around Mercury, and that it will be there for a very long time. He tries to convince Theodor to come with them to the meeting, but the latter refuses. He says that he and his god-friends like to keep some of their thoughts secret, and the other gods have forbidden them to. They follow them to hunt them down. They sail off in their great round silver boats, and Celeste dreams of them dreaming. The other gods are angry and scared, and they are frightened of the thoughts they may think in secret. They do not want to think about them, but they do not know how to stop them. Rosalind Wolver, a member of the committee, comes in through the opposite side of the room, and softly shuts it behind her. She tells Theodor that she is bringing her daughter, Frieda, and her granddaughter, Dotty, to see Theodor. She says that she wants complete security in Theodor, but he is just one-third of her husband. She wants to look for it in Edmund or Ivan, but a woman wants her source of security whole, and it is disturbing to have it divided. She is upset with Theodor because he is a whole and indivisible family, so she cannot find it in him. She asks Theodor if he is not suggesting that the polygamous family is going to be punished for their sins by a cosmic catastrophe, and he says that fire from heaven and all that. He just wanted to give her a picture of her feeling. He tells her that she has to give up on the idea of unchanging scientific law because she is a woman. She smiles and says that they have gone too fast with space-flight and the Deep Shaft and complex marriages. She cannot see that anything has changed. She does not want complete security. She needs something to cling to, so Theodor explains that she needs to find Theodor in him, but her husband is not there. She wonders why Theodor does not come to her rescue. She tries to come to Theodor's husband, but is unable to find it.",
    "The principle of mental privacy is one of the most important aspects of the story. Theodor and his fellow members of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes believe that the disappearance of the two planets Phobos and Deimos is due to a cosmic catastrophe. They believe that this event is a sign of the end of the solar system, and that the other gods are following them and trying to hunt them down. They are afraid of the thoughts that they may think in secret, and so they try to keep these thoughts secret. The other gods, however, are angry and scared, and they are trying to prevent this from happening. The principle of privacy is the reason why Theodor, Celeste, and Theodor are able to sail off in their great round silver boats in the beginning of this story, and it is also the reason for their success in their quest to find the truth of the matter.",
    "Rosalind Wolver is Theodor\u2019s wife and the daughter of Theodor and Celeste. Rosalind is a beautiful young woman in her twenties, dressed in a scarlet cloak and green culottes with a silver jacket. She is a member of a sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes, which is investigating the disappearance of the planets Phobos and Deimos. She and her husband, Theodor, are the only members of the family who believe in the theory of the \u201cDance of the Planets,\u201d which is described in the book as a collection of mythological names of major and minor planets in the Solar System. They sail off in their great round silver boats, but the other gods are angry and scared. They follow them to hunt them down. They are afraid of the thoughts they may think in secret, so they keep some of their thoughts secret. Theodor tells her that they will be late because they have to go to the Buddhist temple for a meeting. When they arrive, she is there with her daughter, and Theodor tries to convince her to come with them. She says that she needs something to cling to, but Theodor reminds her that he is only one-third of her husband and that she should look for it in Edmund or Ivan. She tells him that she wants complete security in him, but he doesn\u2019t have it in her. She goes to the meeting with Theodor to present the evidence for the next shake-up of planets, and he tries to explain to her that Jupiter was supposed to have started as the outermost planet, and is to end up in the orbit of Mercury, but nothing like that has happened. After the meeting, she goes to see her husband Theodor. He tries to tell her that the planets and moons trade position is very often, but she refuses to believe him because she is a woman, and she wants her source of security to be in her husband. She asks Theodor if they are a whole and indivisible family, to which Theodor says that they are not, and that he cannot make it sound funny because Jupiter is supposed to start as outer-most planet and ends up in orbit around Mercury. He also tells her about the Disordered Space Hypothesis, which he says is a chancephrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist. She refuses to accept it because it is fantastically far-fetched, so Theodor explains that the experience of people with Extra-Sensory Perception may give them a clue. She also tells him about the two tiny moons that disappeared during a period when the eyes of astronomy are not on them, and the planet Phobos is low on the horizon. She then goes to sleep, and when Theodor wakes up, he tells her the story of how he and his god friends sail off to Mars in their ships. When he wakes up again, he finds her in the middle of a conversation with her. He explains that she is the granddaughter of a Kometevsky, a man who believes in the idea of a cosmic catastrophe. He asks her if she is angry with him about something, but Celeste says she does not want to discuss it because she wants to be left alone. He tells her to look for the source of her security in Theodor because he is the only one who can find it in him. When Theodor asks her why she is upset with him, she tells him she needs complete security. She explains that her husband is just a third of the father of her children, so she wants it in the man who she married.",
    "Dotty\u2019s dreams are significant because they are connected with the disappearance of Phobos and Deimos. She dreams that she and her husband, Theodor, are sailing off in their great round silver boats with their god friends, and that they are being followed by the other gods. The other gods are angry and scared of the thoughts they may think in secret, and they follow them to hunt them down. Theodor and his god friends like to keep some of their thoughts secret, but the other Gods have forbidden them to. They follow us to hunt us down, and there are many more of them than of us. Therefore, they are frightened of the thought that they may be followed by other gods, so they do not reveal their thoughts to the rest of the world. Theodortold her warmly that he is not suggesting, are you, that we\u2019re going to be punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from heaven and all that? Don\u2019t be silly, I just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling. Celeste smiles. She is a woman. In acrisis like this, it is disturbing to have it divided. Well, we are a whole and indivisible family, so Theodor assures her that we are not. However, she still wants complete security, and she cannot find it in Theodor. He tries to come to her rescue. Perhaps she should look for it in Edmund or Ivan, but a woman wants her source of security whole. In the end, she decides to go to the Buddhist temple, where she meets her daughter, Frieda, and her friend, Madge, who is also a member of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes.

She wants to be by herself and think, but Theodor reminds her that her husband is just one-third of her husband. She asks Theodor if he is angry with her about something, but he tells her that she does not need to be angry with him because he is a part of the family. She also tells him that she will be there when the Earth jumps, so he promises her that he will see her when they meet again.",
    "Celeste's attitude towards other members of her family is very different from her husband Theodor. She is a woman who wants complete security in her marriage, and she wants it in her husband. Theodor is her source of security, but she does not want to find it in him. She wants to be by herself and think, and her god-friends like Theodor like to keep some of their thoughts secret, but the other gods have forbidden them to. When Theodor and his friends enter the committee room, she is angry and scared. They follow them to hunt them down because they are afraid of the thoughts they may think in secret. She does not like that they follow her and Theodor because she is a circus mother watching her sick child before she goes out for the trapeze act. She also does not trust that Theodor will be there because he is a Kometevskyite, a man who has never been a part of the family before. Her husband is the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this might happen. She says it almost apologetically, but Theodor looks anything but a fanatic, so it makes it much worse. In fact, there are several more convincing alternate explanations, such as the Disordered Space Hypothesis, which Theodor rejects because it is little more than a chancephrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist. He ends up by taking a different tack: Besides, if Phobos and Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they would have been picked up by a scope or radar. Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter are smaller than many of the asteroids, but Madge points out that they are bigger than most of the ones in the Solar System. She swings the book under her arm and looks them up and down. People must have felt like this when Aristarches first hinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feet is falling dizzily through space. Only it is worse for us, because they cannot see that anything has changed. We can. You need something to cling to, she heard Madge say. Theodortold her warmly. Well, we are a whole and indivisible family, Theodor tells her that he is not suggesting, are you, that we are going to be punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from heaven and all that? Don't be silly. He just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling. Celeste smiles. She doesn't want to move too fast because she cannot find the security in Theodor, who is just one-third of her husband, so she walks slowly, walking slowly. She tries to look for it in Edmund or Ivan, but he does not seem to be the father. In acrisis like this, it is disturbing to have it divided, so Theodor tries to comfort her. He also tries to come to her rescue, but Celeste does not believe that she is to blame for the polygamous family's sins. He tries to explain that they have gone too fast with space-flight and the Deep Shaft and complex marriages.

But it's begun, and the two moons have appeared. She can't argue with that stubborn little fact. She cannot explain that Mars' two tiny moons had simply vanished during a period when the eyes of astronomy weren't on them. Mars is a hundred-odd cubic miles of rock, and they have carried away with them the security of a whole world.",
    "The story begins with a farmer, Harry, waking up in bed with his wife Edna. Edna begs him to see the doctor living in a new house, but he refuses because he refuses to admit that he is sick in the head. He has not seen the old Chevvy in a long time, and he cannot go further than Walt and Gloria Shanks\u2019 place because it is against the travel regulations. He goes to the tractor shed to tear it down and leaves it there until he has use for it. Then he goes to work, milking and currying and feeding and cleaning, and still has two hours to go before Edna comes home. After lunch, Edna brings him a plate of hotcakes and coffee in a cup, and then he sits down to eat. He looks down at the television program guide and sees that there is nothing good on this week, only one channel. He gives Edna a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag that says \u201ctelevision program guide\u201d from nine to eleven at night. He then goes back to the house, where he sees that Edna is soaking dishes in the sink, according to the dishes that she does every day. She is looking at him. He realizes that something is wrong with the way he has built his barn, so he goes down to the hay-strewn floor of the barn. He stops, puts out his hand as if to find a pole or beam that is too familiar to require raising his eyes, and almost falls as he leans in that direction. Regaining his balance after a sidewardstaggering shuffle, he looks around, startled. He hears his own voice, and stops. He fought the flash of senselesspanic, of course this was the way that he had built the barn, because it was his barn! He goes quickly across the yard, past the pig-pen and past the house to where the half-acre truck farm lay greening in the sun. He got to work. He milked and curried and fed and cleaned, and was done in two hours. He went to the kitchen, where Edna had hotcakes on a plate and coffee. He sat down and ate. He looked down the listings of old movies, all of them new to her. He gave it to her, turned away, and waited. She said it now. He\u2019s gonna lie down, I\u2019m gonna see this movie with Clark Gable. He turned and stepped forward, and found himself facing the stove. Not the door to the hall; the stove, but the door.... he begins. He cut himself short. He turns and sees the door a few feet to the left, beside the table, he goes thereand out and up the stairs (they too had moved; they too weren\u2019t right). He goes into the bedroom and lay down. The bedroom was wrong. The windows were wrong, the world was wrong! Lord, the whole damned world is wrong! Edna didn't wake him, so they had a late lunch. The currentcrisis, you know. The way she said it irritated him. Like it was Scripture; like no one could question one word of it without being damned to Hell. He finishedquickly and without speaking. He walked out to the barn and checked the chickens right. They had only a dozen or so now, and when had he sold his other livestock? Or had they died somehow? A rough winter? Disease? He stood in the yard and thought about his anger and his anger. He realized his anger at the situation. He decided to go to the bathroom and wash his hands.",

His face is now only long and lean. He has gray eyes and a face that looks as if it has been grayed in the past. He also has a round, tanned face and strong arms growing stronger each day from helping out after school. When Edna calls to him, Harry remembers that he has never seen this movie with Clark Gable nor the comedy with Red Skeleton nor the other five neither. He turns and steps forward, facing the stove, not the door to the hall, but the door. He cuts himself short, he turns and sees the door a few feet to the left, beside the table. He goes there, out and up the stairs, and into the bedroom. The bedroom is wrong. The windows are wrong, the whole damned world is wrong! Edna didn\u2019t wake him, so they had a late lunch. He finished quickly and without speaking went on out to the barn. He milked and curried and fed and cleaned, and still was done insideof two hours.

Of course this was the way he\u2019d had his barn built, because it was his barn! He rubbed his hard hands together and said aloud, Get down to the patch. He walked outside and took a deep breath. He went quickly across the yard, past the pig-pen and past the house to where the half-acre truck farm lay greening in the sun. He got to work. Sometimelater, Edna called to him. He hauled out a sack of flour, half the amount of sugar Edna had ordered, some dried fruit, a new Homekit medicine shelf. He carried itinto the house, and noticed a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag. Atelevision program guide. Edna hustled over excitedly. He looked down the listings, all old movies. He gave it to her, turned away; then stopped and waited. He had said the same thing last week, and she said the films were all new to her. She said it now. He decided to lie down, and then remembered that he had no children. He felt the fear again, and got up fast to escape it; Edna opened the stove. He turned and stepped forward, and found himself facing the door in the hall; the door had moved. He cut himself short and saw the door was not the one he had left, so he went there. The world was wrong! He went to the bedroom and lay down. The window was wrong, too, the windows were wrong, everything was wrong. He remembered that the tractor was in town, being overhauled, and he was leaving it there until he had use for it; he went on toward the road, his head beginning to throb. He saw the tractor shed fifty feet from the house; he had torn it down. He thought about the car, but it was no use to him lying in a tractor shed. The tractor was already in town; he decided to leave it there.",

The house also has a stove, and there is a door on the left side beside the table. The tractor is in town, being overhauled and all, so Harry is leaving it there until he has use for it. The barn is fifty feet away from the house, and it has a tractor that he tore down. He goes out to feed the chickens and feed the rest of the livestock, and then he goes to the house to see Edna, who is cleaning dishes in the sink. The story then moves to the dining room, where Edna has hotcakes for lunch and coffee in a cup. Later, Harry goes to bed, and Edna calls to him, asking him to take some rest. The bedroom is wrong, the windows are wrong, and the whole world is wrong. When Harry wakes up in the morning, the house is in a shabby state. The windows are broken, the bed is crooked, the furniture is not right, and everything seems to be out of place. He decides to go to the library to look at some old movies, but it is too late. The library is full of old ones, so he leaves the library and heads home. When he gets there, he sees that the library has not been updated in a very long time. He then goes to see the doctor, who tells him that he is sick in the head, but Harry refuses to see him because it is against the travel regulations. The next day, Edna brings him a sack of flour, half the amount of sugar Edna had ordered, some dried fruit, a new Homekit medicine shelf, and a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag with a television program guide.

    "Some of the government regulations that are imposed in the story are about the new regulations about wheat and corn. These regulations require farmers to plant a certain amount of acreage for each year, as well as the planting of certain types of crops, such as corn, rye, and wheat. The regulations also require that farmers to pay their bills on time, so that they do not run out of money. In addition, the government also requires that farmers must have a specific amount of time to tend to their crops, and that they must pay their debts to the government. In the end, all of these regulations lead to the destruction of Harry\u2019s farm.",
    "The story begins with Herbert Quidley reading a history of English literature by Adolphe Taine when he sees a young girl walking in the door. She is accompanied by a tall and lissome girl named Kay Smith. He follows her as she goes to the literature section of the library to see if she is interested in reading Taine\u2019s History of English Literature. When she leaves, he returns the book to the shelf and takes Taine down once more, just as he had suspected, the makeshift bookmark is gone. He remembers how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines of gibberish and then reappeared again, a camouflaged message, so he decides to return Taine to its original position. After learning from the librarian that the girl's name is Kay Smith, he goes out and gets in his hardtop. Halfway home he realizes why. The typing exercise had contained the word Cai, and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got Kai - or Kay. Obviously, the exercise had been a message, and had been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream of borrowing by whom - her boy friend. He decides to keep Taine's History under observation for a while, keeping Kay Smith under observation. Her boy friend turns out to be her girl friend, and her only faults are little ones. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading table, he sees her take a seemingly haphazard routeto the shelf where Taine is reposed, take the volume down, surreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages, and return it to the library shelf. After she leaves he notices that the second message is as unintelligible as the first: asdf ;lkj asdf, FieuDayol, and snoll doper. He thinks that the last word - Yoolna - is the name of the girl he has just seen, and that she is a different person from the Klio whose name had appended the first message. He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the bookto the shelf, and goes back to the reading table and The Zeitgeist. Kay doesn't show up till almost closing time, and he is beginning to think that perhaps she wouldn't come around for the pickup tilltomorrow when she finally walks in. She employed the sametactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though bychance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same exact legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walks out the door, he is not far behind her. She climbs into a sleek convertible and pulls into the street. It takes him but a moment to gain his hard top and starts out after her. When several blocks later, she pulls to the curb in front of an all-night coffee bar, he follows suit. After that, he decides on Operation Spill-the-sugar. The procedure was quite simple. First you take note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you situate yourself so that your intended victim is between you and the nearest one, and then you order coffee without sugar in a low voice, and after the counterman or countergirl has served you, you wait until she is out of earshot and asks your i.v. to pass the sugar. He asks the dispenser slip from his fingers in such away that some of its contents spilled on her lap, and she apologizes, but he brushes it off, saying it is all right, it is only sugar. She says she is hopelessly clumsy and asks him to forgive her. He tells her to send the bill to the cleaners and has them send it to him. He gives her his address and sends it to her. The next day, she arrives at 61 Park Place. He pulls out his wallet, chooses an appropriate card, and hands her a printout of her profile. She asks him when can she call. He says he can call her when she is ready.",
    "Kay Smith is the girl that Quidley meets at the beginning of the story. She is described as tall and lissome with a Helenesque air of her own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading table, she takes a seemingly haphazard routeto the shelf where Taine\u2019s History reposed, takes the volume down, surreptitiously slips a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages, and returns it to the shelf. After she leaves, he traces her movements out of their corners. When she comes to the O's she pauses, takes down a book, looks through it, replaces it, and moves on to the P's, the Q's, and the R's. Barely three feet from him, she pauses again and takes down Taine's History of English Literature. The odds against two persons taking an interest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library are ten thousand to one, and she is riffling through it with the air of a seasoned browser. Presently she returns the book to the shelves, selected another book at random, and takes it over to the librarian's desk. This time, when she walks out the door, he is not far behind her. She climbs into a sleek convertible and pulls into the street. Ittook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her. Several blocks later, she pulls to the curb in front of an all-night coffee bar, and he follows suit. He decides on Operation Spill-the-sugar. He remembers how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines of gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was it merely what it appeared to be on the surface - the efforts of animpatient typing student to type before his time? He returns Taine to its shelf and goes to the library to find Kay Smith. After learning from the library librarian that her name is Kay Smith, he goes out and rings a bell. The typing exercise had contained the word Cai, and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got Kai - or Kay. Obviously, the exercise had been a message, and had been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream of borrowing by whom - her boy friend. She has a rather striking profile yourself, Miss. Smith. She set the cup back on the counter and turns and faces him. For a second her eyes seemed to expand till they preoccupied his entire vision, till he could see nothing but their disturbingly clear - and suddenly cold -blueness. Panic touched him, then vanished when she says, Would you really consider word-painting my profile, Mr. Quidly? Would he! When can I call? She says that she is sorry, but her address is 61 Park Place. He pulls out his wallet, chooses an appropriate card, and hands it to her. He sends her a message. He tells her that he is hopelessly clumsy, but she begs him to forgive her. If she like, she can send it to The Zeitgeist and have them send the bill to him. He gives her his address and sends her the bill.",
    "Herbert Quidley is the protagonist of the story. He is a young man with a penchant for old books. He enjoys old wood, paintings, and old wine. He likes young girls, and he especially likes them when they look the way Helen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and started building his ladder. When he first looks into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine\u2019s History of English Literature, he finds a sheet of yellow copypaper with the words \u201cWotnid, FieuDayol, and snoll doper\u201d printed on it. He then sees a young girl, Yoolna, walking in the door. He follows her as she goes to the literature section, and when she leaves, he returns the book to the shelf and takes Taine down once more. He remembers how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines of gibberish and then reappeared again, a camouflaged message. After learning from the librarian that her name is Kay Smith, he goes out and gets in his hardtop car. He returns to the library and sees her again, this time in a convertible. She is a tall and lissome girl with a Helenesque air of her own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading table, he observes her take a seemingly haphazard routeto the shelf where Taine's History reposed, take the volume down, surreptitiously slip a folded piece of yellow paper between its pages, and return it to the shelve. When she walks out the door, he is not far behind her. She climbs into a sleek convertible and pulls into the street. It takes him but a moment to gain his hard top and start out after her. He decides on Operation Spill-the-sugar. He orders coffee without sugar in a low voice, and after the counterman or countergirl serves it, he waits until the girl is out of earshot and asks her to pass the sugar. He lets the dispenser slip from his fingers in such a way that some of its contents spill on her lap, and she apologizes for it, but he brushes it off, saying that it is only sugar. She apologizes, too, and tells him that she is hopelessly clumsy. He tells her to forgive him, but she says that he needs to brush it off. She asks him to paint her profile, which he agrees to. He gives her his card and sends her on her way. He asks her if she would like to call him when she gets a chance, but her number is not listed, so he sends her a message that he will be there in a few minutes. She says that she has a boy friend and that he is her fiance, and the word fiance brings to mind the word \u201cfiance\u201d again. He doesn\u2019t want to marry her, but the word brings to his mind another word that repels him: I. I.e., marriage. He calls her back and tells her that he has to take her to the cleaners and has them send the bill to him. She tells him she is sorry for the mess she made. He apologizes to her and says that it will be all right, and they will pay the bill. He goes back to reading The Zeitgeist, and then goes to bed.",
    "The snoll doper plays a significant role in the story because it is one of the first things that Quidley notices when he sees the girl from Fieu Dayol. When he first sees her, she is sitting in the library with her girl friend, and she is reading a copy of Taine\u2019s History of English Literature. When she leaves, he returns the book to the shelf, and he follows her. He realizes that the girl is not the same girl from the previous night, and that she is a different person from the Klio whose name had appended the first message. This makes him realize that the word \u201cfiance\u201d is in the same code as the one in the Taine tome, which makes him think that this girl is different from the one that he has seen before. He also realizes that her name is Yoolna, and the last word is \u201cYoolna.\u201d This leads him to believe that she might be the same person as the girl he saw earlier, and this makes him decide to call her and ask her out for a date. However, when he goes to pick up the girl, she comes back and tells him that she can\u2019t marry him because she is engaged to a boy named Cai. This causes him to reconsider his decision to keep Taine's History under observation for the time being.",
    "The story takes place in the city of Fieu Dayol. The first part of the story is set in a library, where Quidley meets a young girl, Kay Smith, and her friend, a tall and lissome woman with a Helenesque air of her own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading table, he watches her take a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine\u2019s History reposed, take the volume down, surreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages, and return it to the library shelf. After she leaves, he returns to the reading table and The Zeitgeist, where he sees the girl walk in the door. She is tall, with hyacinth hair and liquid blue eyes, and she has a Grecian symmetry of shape that would have made Paris\u2019 eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Her boy friend turns out to be her girl friend, and their only faults are little ones. The girls from Fieu dayol are lovely and quick to learn, and they seem to be in love with each other. The story then moves to a coffee bar, where she orders a coffee without sugar in a low voice, and asks the barman or countergirl to pass the sugar. When she does so, she lets the dispenser slip from her fingers in such a way that some of its contents spilled on her lap, and Quidly apologizes for it. She returns the book to the librarian, and he follows her into a sleek convertible and pulls into the street. After a few blocks, she pulls to the curb in front of an all-night coffee bar and asks him to follow her inside. He decides to use Operation Spill-the-sugar, a procedure that has stood him in good stead before. The procedure is quite simple: first you take note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you position yourself so that your intended victim is between you and the nearest one, and after the counterman or barman has served you, you wait until he or she is out of earshot. Then you order coffee without any sugar, and wait until they are out of sight, and ask them to pass it on to the next person. When the girl arrives, he takes Taine down once more, and the makeshift bookmark is gone. He remembers how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines of gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was it merely what it appeared to be on the surface - the efforts of animpatient typing student to type before his time? He returns Taine to the other side of the shelf, and learns from the girl that her name is Yoolna, and that she is a different person from the Klio whose name had appended the first message. He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the bookto the shelf and goes back to his reading table. He then goes to the Zeitgeist and sees that the girl is walking towards him. He follows her, and when she walks out of the door, he is not far behind her. She climbs into the convertible and drives off, and it takes him but a moment to gain his hardtop and starts out after her. He pulls into a street and follows her. After several blocks later, she stops at an all night coffee bar. He orders a cup of coffee and waits for her inside, and then follows her inside and orders some more coffee. He explains to her that he is sorry for spilling the sugar on her and asks her to forgive him. She apologizes and says that it is only sugar, but he is hopelessly clumsy, so he brushes it off. She says that she can send the bill to the cleaners and has them send it to him. They go to her address. She then goes out into the misty April night.",
    "The story begins with the captain of the Martian Maid, Fred Copeland, standing in the valve of the ship, watching the loading cranes pull away on his last flight. He is on his way to Callisto on a mission for the Holcomb Foundation. He thinks of his half empty cargo hold and the sweet payload that he would pick up on Callistero. He also thinks of the extra cash his packets of snow would bring from those lonely men up there on the barren moonlets of the outer Systems. The crew of the Maid is a rough bunch, like all those early crews. He remembers them as hungry men with hell in their eyes and a great lust for high pay and hard living. Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski. There wasn't a man on board who wouldn't have traded his immortal soul for a few solar dollars, and he doesn't claim that he was any different. Captain Copeland is the one who finds the derelict ship, which he assumes is a Foundationship. He calls Cohn, the Metering Officer, and shows him his figures. Cohn\u2019s dark eyes lit up as they always do when he works with figures. The math is quite correct, Captain, he says. The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and he orders the tug of the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. The ship is on a near collision course, and the captain calls his crew. He wonders why in hell he wants to leave the relativesecurity of the Earth-Mars-Venus Triangle to go jetting across the belt into deep space and the drab desolation of outer System. He stands there, looking at the lights of Canalopolis in the distance. The lights of the gin mills and houses made as a filigree pattern on the dark waters of the ancient canal cast their shifting shadows across the silted banks. He was too far away to see the space-fevered bums and smell the shanties, and for a little while he felt the wonder of standing on the soil of a world that man had made his own with his rapacity and his sheer guts and gimme. I thought of our half empty spaceship and its sweet payload. He counted the extra money that would bring him from the lonely men on the outer systems. There were plenty of cargoes carried on the Maid that the Foundation snoopers never heard about, and they did it for the advancement of civilization. In those days, the asteroid belt was the primary danger and menace toastrogation. For a long while it held men back from deep space, but as fuel improved, ships were sent out over the top. A few millionmiles up out of the ecliptic plane brings you to a region of spacethat's pretty thinly strewn with asteroids, and that's the way we used to make the flight between the outer system and the EMV Triangle. It took a long time for hyperdrives to be developed and of course atomics never panned out because of the weight problem. The Maid took on that last trip of mine, high and clear into the supra-solar void. And out there in that primeval blackness is where we found a derelict. He doesn't realize it at the time, but it wasn't too long ago that he lifted the Maid off Solis Lacus on her last flight, so many advances have been made in the last few years. He assumes that the ship is a new class of ship, but there is something different about this one. All spaceships look pretty much alike, but he sees something different when he sits at the telescope. At such adistance, he can't get too much detail in his small three inch glass, but can see that the hulk is big - bigger than any ship he's ever seen before. He had the radar fixed on her and retracing her orbit. It wasn't long before he discovers that the derelict ship has a strange orbit that is strange, so he calls Cohn - the metering officer - and tells him that the figures look right to him. He tells him to assemble the ship's company. He orders the assembly horn sounding throughout the maid and orders the crew to leave their stations, so the crew is assembled in Control. The men are assembled in",
    "Captain Midas is the captain of the Martian Maid. He is an old man with gray hair, and his face is a mask. His flesh hangs on his bones like a yellow cloth on a rickety frame, and he is old, old, and full of an unreasoning, unthinking love for gold. He rides a golden ship that they paid for with all the years of their lives, bought and paid for. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that he lifted the Maid off Solis Lacus on her last flight. Not many of you will remember her class of ship, so many advances have been made in the last few years. The Maid was two hundred feet from tip to tail, and as sleek a spacer as ever came out of the Foundation Yards. She was armed, too. Captain Midas was a rough bunch, like all those early crews. Lean, hungry men with hell in their eyes and a great lust for high pay and hard living. Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski, and Shelley are all men that opened up the spaceways, too, so he is proud of it. He has a great desire to keep what they could out there, but there are strange things in the sky, things that do not respond to all of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are nopart of the world of men, thick with danger, and horror. The Martian Maid is on a near collision course with the Maid, and there is something about its orbit that is strange. He calls Cohn, the Metering Officer, and shows him his figures. Cohn\u2019s dark eyes lit up as they always do when he works with figures. The math is quite correct, Captain, he said. The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug of the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soonthey were assembled in Control. Mr. Cohn, assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn, I ordered. Assemble the ships\u2019 company, Mr. Midas orders. Captain Spinelli is the first to report that the ship is in distress, either abandoned or in distress. Reaching intothe book rack above his desk, he takes down a copy of The Foundation's Space Regulations and opens it to the section concerning salvage. Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary Astrogation and Commerce, he reads, Any vessel or part of it can be salvaged. The ship is to be sent to Callisto, a planet that has been colonized by a man named Jason. The crew of the Maid is made up of men that are old, hungry, and greedy. They are greedy and hasty, and they ride a ship that is full of gold. Captain spends a lot of time thinking about his half empty cargo hold and the sweet payload that he would pick up on Callistero. He thinks about the extra cash his packets of snow would bring from those lonely men up there on the barren moonlets of the outer Systems. There were plenty of cargoes carried on the Maid that the Holcomb Foundation snoopers never heard about, and the men did it for the advancement of civilization. He also thinks about his share of the salvage money that he has in his pocket. He does not believe that there is such a thing as a noble pioneer in space or anywhere else. He says that the men are greedy, greedy, and that they do not let go until Hell freezes over. The man who is on board the Maid has millions of dollars in his hands. He feels the pain of pain, sorrow, agony, and agony.",
    "The story takes place on Mars. The first part of the story is set in the control room of the ship, the Maid. The ship is on a mission to find a ship that has been lost in space. The story then moves to outer space, where the ship is found by the ship\u2019s captain, Fred Copeland, in a derelict ship. This is where the story ends.",
    "Captain Midas and Mister Spinelli are two of the most important characters in the story. Captain Midas is the captain of the Maid, a ship that ferries men to and from deep space. He is a greedy and hasty man, full of an unreasoning, unthinking love for gold, and he rides a golden ship that they paid for with all the years of their lives. The crew is a rough bunch, like all those early crews. They are hungry, hungry men with hell in their eyes and a great lust for high pay and hard living. Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski, and Shelley are all men that opened up the spaceways, too. They ride high in the sky, dust by this time, and all because they were men, and men are greedy and quick to think and greedy. The ship they ride on is named the Maid and is two hundred feet long from tip to tail, and is as sleek as any ship that has ever come out of the Foundation Yards. She was armed, too, and was considered to be a possible stamping ground for alien creatures. The Foundation still thought of space as a possible spot for aliens, though no evidence of any extra-terrestrial life had ever been found. Their crew is rough, hungry, and full of lust for money and a desire to see more of the great things that space has to offer. The captain is also a greedy man, as he thinks of his half empty cargo hold and the sweet payload they would pick up on Callisto. He thinks of the extra cash his packets of snow would bring from those lonely men up there on the barren moonlets of the outer Systems. He has millions in his hands, and the crew is full of cargoes carried on the Maid that the crew never heard about. He feels the weight of years he never lived to drag him under and let him forget the awful things that his eyes have seen. He also feels the tug of pain, sorrow, agony, and pain. He doesn't believe that there is such a thing as a noble pioneer, not in space or anywhere else. Captain Spinelli is the other man on board, and his job is to make sure that the ship is saved. He calls him Mister Cohn, the Metering Officer, and shows him his figures. Mr. Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures, and it didn't take him long to check the inference of those figures on the chart. The math is quite correct, Captain, he said. Assemble the ship's company, Mr Cohn, I ordered. The assembly horn sounded throughout the maid and I could feel the tug-of-the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soonthey were assembled in Control. I said, you have all heard about the find, I havecomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seemsto be a spacer... either abandoned or in distress.... Reaching intothe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the foundation's Space Regulations and opened it to the section concerning salvage. Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary Astrogation and Commerce, I read, Any vessel or part of a vessel can be salvaged. If it is in distress, the ship must be taken to the nearest spaceport. If the ship cannot be saved, it must be returned to its original location.",
    "The mystery metal from the starship is referred to as \u201cgold\u201d in the Code Regulating Interplanetary Astrogation and Commerce. It is the reason for the captain\u2019s departure from the ship, and the reason why he is on his last flight. The ship is on a near collision course with another ship, but there is something strange about its orbit. The captain suspects that it is a spacer, either abandoned or in distress. The crew of the ship is a rough bunch of men, like all those early crews. They are greedy and hasty and full of an unreasoning, unthinking love for gold. They ride a golden ship that they paid for with all the years of their lives. Bought and paid for. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that the captain lifted the Maid off Solis Lacus on her last flight, not many of them will remember her class of ship, so many advances have been made in the last few years. The Maid was two hundred feet from tip to tail, and as sleek as ever came out of the Foundation Yards. She was armed, too. The Foundation still thought of space as a possible stamping ground for alien creatures, though no evidence of extra-terrestrial life had ever been found. My crew was rough. Lean, hungry men with hell in their eyes and a great lust for high pay and hard living. Spinelli, Shelley, Cohn, Marvin, Zaleski, and Shelley are all men that opened up the spaceways. There is no such thing as a noble pioneer, not in space or anywhere else. The adventuring mercenary that pushes the frontier outward. Captain Mickey thinks that he is the kind of man that opens up the space lanes. He is greedy, greedy, and greedy. He thinks of his half empty cargo hold and the sweet payload he would pick up on Callisto. And he thinks of the extra cash his packets of snow would bring from those lonely men up there on the barren moonlets of the outer Systems. There were plenty of cargoes carried on the Maid that the Holcomb Foundation snoopers never heard about, so he is sure of that. In those days the asteroid belt was the primary danger and menace to space travel, but as fuel improved, more ships were sent over the top. He believes that this is the way to make the flight between the outer systems and the EMV Triangle. So that's the orbit the Maid took on that last trip of mine. High and clear into the supra-solar void. And out there in that primeval blackness is where we found the derelict. The mystery metal is gold, and Captain Mickey believes it is treasure beyond his wildest dreams. Gold! A magic word, even today, isn't it? Lust and gold... they go hand in hand. And, of course, there's another word needed to make up the trilogy. You don't get any thing for nothing. So add this: Cost. Or you might call it pain, sorrow, agony. Call it what you like. It's what you pay for great treasure. These things were true when fabled Jason sailed the Argo beyond Colchisseeking the Fleece. And the conquest of space hasn't changed us a bit. We did it for Number One. We hung onto what we found because the risks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there. But there are strange things in the sky. There are things that don't respond to all of our neat little Laws and Theories. Things that are nopart of the world of man, thick with danger. And horror."
