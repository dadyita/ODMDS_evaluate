In reality, the energy created in destroying matter is added to the energy potential of the planet in the form of heat. This poses a threat to the planet as the mean temperature of Earth could rise to the point where it bursts into flame. Therefore, the government intends to confiscate all Expendable devices and ban their manufacture and importation. \n\nHowever, the protagonist points out that simply outlawing the Expendables wouldn't work because people find them convenient. Just like how there is a ban on frivolous use of water due to the dire need, people still find ways to water lawns and fill swimming pools. The same would happen with the Expendables. If the danger of global warming and the rise in temperature were explained to the public, they would hoard Expendables and continue to use them until the catastrophic consequences occur. \n\nTo address this issue, the protagonist proposes using up the excess energy created by the Expendables with engines of a specific design. By reversing the field of the Expendable device and creating a low-efficiency engine, the excess energy can be consumed and prevent the rise in temperature. The young man from the AEC worries about the feasibility of designing these engines in time, but the protagonist reassures him that it can be done. \n\nIn summary, the story \"The Expendables\" addresses the issue of global warming and convenience by highlighting the dangerous impact of the Expendable devices on the Earth's temperature. It explores the conflict between the need to eliminate these devices for the sake of the planet and the convenience they provide to people. The protagonist suggests a solution that involves using up the excess energy with specific engines to prevent the catastrophic consequences of global warming.", "In the story \"The Expendables,\" the theme of capitalism is explored through the character of Tony Carmen and his greed for profits over safety in selling Professor Venetti's machine.

He dismisses any concerns about the potential negative consequences, such as the murder rate increasing, comparing it to the success of Sam Colt and Henry Ford's inventions despite their potential for harm. \n\nCarmen's focus on profits and his willingness to take risks reflects the capitalist mindset of prioritizing financial gain over ethical considerations. He sees the machine as a means to make money, even if it means disregarding safety or potential dangers. This highlights the negative aspects of capitalism, where the pursuit of profit can lead to exploitation and a disregard for the well-being of others.\n\nIn contrast, Professor Venetti is more concerned with the potential misuse and dangers of the machine. He understands the responsibility that comes with his invention and is hesitant to hand it over to Carmen for commercial purposes. He is aware that the government may not know what to do with the machine, as they often acquire things without a clear plan or understanding. Venetti's concerns demonstrate a more cautious and ethical approach, emphasizing the importance of considering the potential consequences of capitalist ventures.\n\nOverall, \"The Expendables\" explores the theme of capitalism through the character of Tony Carmen, who prioritizes profits over safety and ethical considerations.

This revelation excites him, as he realizes the immense wealth that can be obtained from the tons of gold on the derelict ship.\n\nThe significance of the devil-metal, or the gold, is that it represents the allure and temptation of wealth. Captain Midas becomes obsessed with the idea of acquiring the gold and believes it will bring him great fortune. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that the gold is cursed. Captain Midas suffers from a mysterious illness that slowly spreads from his hands, aging him prematurely. The gold has a corrupting effect, causing those who possess it to suffer physically and emotionally.

It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pursuing material possessions without considering the potential negative consequences. The story emphasizes that true treasure lies in the value of human connections and the importance of living a meaningful life, rather than being consumed by the pursuit of wealth."]
