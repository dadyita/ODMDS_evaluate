Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>The second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n  \n \n  \"Retief\u2014I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\n  \n \n  Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\n  \n \n  Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\n  \n \n  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\n  \n \n  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n  \n \n  \"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n  \n \n  \"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n  \n \n  \"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\n  \n \n  The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\n  \n \n  So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n  \n \n  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n  \n \n  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer\u2014and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n  \n \n  At least not willingly....\n  \n \n  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\n  \n<doc-sep>When he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\n  \n \n  The gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\n  \n \n  The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\n  \n \n  It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n  \n \n  \"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\n  \n \n  He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n  \n \n  \"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\n  \n \n  A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\n  \n \n  I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\n  \n \n  And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\n  \n \n  He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\n  \n \n \n   The clock was warm.\n   \n \n \n  He felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\n  \n \n  He touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\n  \n \n  Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\n  \n \n  He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\n  \n"

But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\n  \n \n  He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  It all began on a Saturday\nnight at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  . If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\n  \n \n  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\n  \n \n  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n"

Gwayne felt them wrench at him as his\nhands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in his\nnose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds after\nthe captain's attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavy\nsound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made no\nfurther move, though it was still breathing.\n  \n \n  Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelli\nwas either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free to\nkick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loaded\nonto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monster\non another before heading back.\n  \n \n  \"No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute!\" Barker shook\nhis own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster's landing.\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" Gwayne told him. \"I want that thing to live\u2014and you're\ndetailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make sign\nlanguage or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessy\nand why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be the\nanswer.\"\n  \n \n  Barker nodded grimly. \"I'll try, though I can't risk drugs on an alien\nmetabolism.\" He sucked in on the cigarette he'd dug out, then spat\nsickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. \"Bob, it still\nmakes no sense. We've scoured this planet by infra-red, and there was\nno sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.\"\n  \n \n  \"Troglodytes, maybe,\" Gwayne guessed. \"Anyhow, send for me when you get\nanything. I've got to get this ship back to Earth. We're overstaying\nour time here already.\"\n  \n \n  The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They'd been\npicked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they were\nbusy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soon\nas he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and less\ninformative with retelling.\n  \n \n  If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might save\ntime and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy's ship. That\nwas almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemed\nto be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy's rescue group had\nbeen overcome by the aliens.\n  \n \n  It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could the\nprimitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy's ship? Why was its\nfuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who told\nthese creatures that a space ship's metal finders could be fooled by a\nlittle more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They'd buried the ship\ncunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work.\n  \n \n  Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to find\nsomething\u2014and find it fast. Earth needed every world she could make\nremotely habitable, or mankind was probably doomed to extinction.\n  \n<doc-sep>Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n"

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs.

Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\"\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n  \n \n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City,\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\n  \n \n  \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Down in the great cave that Old Serpent, a two-legged one among whose\nnames were \"Snake-Oil Sam,\" spoke to his underlings:\n  \n \n  \"It'll take them fourteen days to get back with the settlers. We'll\nhave time to overhaul the blasters. We haven't had any well-equipped\nsettlers for six weeks. It used to be we'd hardly have time to strip\nand slaughter and stow before there was another batch to take care of.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think you'd better write me some new lines,\" said Adam. \"I feel like\na goof saying those same ones to each bunch.\"\n  \n \n  \"You are a goof, and therefore perfect for the part. I was in show\nbusiness long enough to know never to change a line too soon. I did\nchange Adam and Eve to Ha-Adamah and Hawwah, and the apple to the\npomegranate. People aren't becoming any smarter\u2014but they are becoming\nbetter researched, and they insist on authenticity.\n  \n \n  \"This is still a perfect come-on here. There is something in human\nnature that cannot resist the idea of a Perfect Paradise. Folks will\nwhoop and holler to their neighbors to come in droves to spoil and mar\nit. It isn't greed or the desire for new land so much\u2014though that is\nstrong too. Mainly it is the feverish passion to befoul and poison what\nis unspoiled. Fortunately I am sagacious enough to take advantage of\nthis trait. And when you start to farm a new world on a shoestring you\nhave to acquire your equipment as you can.\"\n  \n \n  He looked proudly around at the great cave with its mountains and tiers\nof materials, heavy machinery of all sorts, titanic crates of foodstuff\nspace-sealed; wheeled, tracked, propped, vaned and jetted vehicles; and\npower packs to run a world.\n  \n \n  He looked at the three dozen space ships stripped and stacked, and at\nthe rather large pile of bone-meal in one corner.\n  \n \n  \"We will have to have another lion,\" said Eve. \"Bowser is getting old,\nand Marie-Yvette abuses him and gnaws his toes. And we do have to have\na big-maned lion to lie down with the lamb.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know it, Eve. The lion is a very important prop. Maybe one of the\ncrackpot settlers will bring a new lion.\"\n  \n \n  \"And can't you mix another kind of shining paint? This itches. It's\nhell.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it.\"\n  \n"

I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n  \n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n  \n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n  \n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n  \n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n  \n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n  \n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\n  \n \n \n  Noork\n  \n \n \n  At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n  \n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n  \n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n  \n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n  \n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n  \n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n  \n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n  \n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n  \n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\n  \n<doc-sep>Mickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \"I don't\nsee 'em, Ben,\" he whispered. \"Where do you suppose they are?\"\n  \n \n  I blinked. \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"My folks.\"\n  \n \n  That was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in\na strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those\n\"You are cordially invited\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie\nTaggart.\n  \n \n  Stardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a\nveteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years\nago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the\n   \n   Lunar\nLady\n   \n  , a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White\nSands.\n  \n \n  I remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island\nSpaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like\nme until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I\nremembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\n  \n \n  My gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It\nwasn't surprising. The\n   \n   Lunar Lady\n   \n  was in White Sands now, but\nliberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.\n  \n \n \n   It doesn't matter\n   \n  , I told myself.\n  \n \n  Then Mickey stiffened. \"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\"\n  \n \n  Usually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a\ngarden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a\ntenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that\nhe was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at\nthe Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was\nmighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only\nhalf as big.\n  \n \n  And then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we\nwere gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw\nthe stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each\nlike a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by\nthe sons of Earth.\n  \n \n \n   They expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of\ncivilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and\na hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do.\n   \n \n \n  I felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared.\n  \n"

Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth.

And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Birds of a Feather\n  \n \n  By ROBERT SILVERBERG\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WOOD\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine November 1958.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Getting specimens for the interstellar zoo\n    \n   was no problem\u2014they battled for the honor\u2014but\n    \n   now I had to fight like a wildcat to\n    \n   keep a display from making a monkey of me!\n   \n \n \n \n  It was our first day of recruiting on the planet, and the alien\nlife-forms had lined up for hundreds of feet back from my rented\noffice.

Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still.

It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course.

Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come\u2014for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas\u2014ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n  \n<doc-sep>The dead man was real. His name was Cobb. He was stout and flabby and\nabout forty and he hated spacemen.\n  \n \n  His body was buried now\u2014probably in the silent gray wastes outside\nLuna City. But he'd become a kind of invisible Siamese twin, as much a\npart of Ben as sight in his eyes.\n  \n \n  Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him, its lips\nspitting whiskey-slurred curses.\n  \n \n  Again, its face would be a pop-eyed mask of surprise as Ben's fist\nthudded into its jaw. More often, the face would be frozen in the\nwhiteness of death. The large eyes would stare. Blood would trickle\nfrom a corner of the gaping mouth.\n  \n \n  You can forget a living man. You can defeat him or submit to him or\nignore him, and the matter is over and done. You can't escape from a\nmemory that has burned into your mind.\n  \n \n  It had begun a week ago in Luna City. The flight from White Sands had\nbeen successful. Ben, quietly and moderately, wanted to celebrate.\nHe stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer. The man named Cobb\nplopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him.\n  \n \n  \"Spacemen,\" he muttered, \"are getting like flies. Everywhere, all you\nsee's spacemen.\"\n  \n \n  He was a neatly dressed civilian.\n  \n \n  Ben smiled. \"If it weren't for spacemen, you wouldn't be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"The name's Cobb.\" The man hiccoughed. \"Spacemen in their white monkey\nsuits. They think they're little tin gods. Betcha you think you're a\nlittle tin god.\" He downed a shot of whiskey.\n  \n \n  Ben stiffened. He was twenty-four and dressed in the white,\ncrimson-braided uniform of the\n   \n   Odyssey's\n   \n  junior astrogation officer.\nHe was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining\nuniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe.\n  \n \n  He'd sought long for that key.\n  \n"

The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked.

The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come\u2014for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n<doc-sep>The weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n  \n \n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n  \n \n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n  \n \n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come\u2014for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas\u2014ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n  \n<doc-sep>Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  \u2014Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night\u2014for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time\u2014Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it?

However....\" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.\nRetief raised one eyebrow.\n  \n \n  \"For a minute there,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to make a\npositive statement.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The first thing you learn in school is that if it weren't for idiot and\ncriminal people like these, Earth would never have been destroyed. The\nevacuation would never have had to take place, and eight billion people\nwouldn't have died. There wouldn't have\n   \n   been\n   \n  eight billion people.\nBut, no. They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in\ntheir path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth\nhad and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came.\n  \n \n  I am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough\nforesight to see what was coming. If it hadn't been for them and some\nothers like them, there wouldn't be any humans left anywhere. And I\nwouldn't be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me.\n  \n \n  What happened before, when people didn't use their heads and wound up\nblowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The\nolder people don't let us forget. But these people had, and that the\nCouncil should know.\n  \n \n  For the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt\n   \n   really\n   \n  frightened. There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I\nfelt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I\nwhomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.\n  \n \n  I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk\nagain. I couldn't help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he's\nsmart and brains I needed.\n  \n \n  How do you find out what's going on? Eavesdrop? That's a lousy method.\nFor one thing, people can't be depended on to talk about the things you\nwant to hear. For another, you're likely to get caught. Ask somebody?\nWho? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind\nup with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think\nof was to find a library, but that might be a job.\n  \n \n  I'd had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren't the last. In the\nlate afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was\nstarting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the\nsky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what\nhad gone wrong.\n  \n \n  I reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal.\nThe scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to\ndrop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin's style. I\ntriggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't\nknow why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry.\n  \n \n  The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my\nhead, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started\nbucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain\nidiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me\noverhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours.\nNot too different, but not ours.\n  \n \n \n \n  One more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and\nwe wouldn't tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that\ntakes an advanced technology to build.\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n"

A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n  \n \n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n  \n \n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n  \n"

        "In the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low\ncloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. The\nthree mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight of\nhis immense shell on the heavy plank flooring.\n  \n \n  \"Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth we\nbludgeoned aboard the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  ,\" he sighed. \"Soon will I be forced\ninto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as I\nwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-daily\nfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is no\npleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismal\noutlook for one's next thousand years!\"\n  \n \n  \"You two carry on to the police station,\" said Retief. \"I want to play\na hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.\"\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014?\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"As you wish, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped\ndown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood\nvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.\n  \n \n  \"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police\nprotection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a\nposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring\nblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed\nwrong....\n  \n \n  There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.\n  \n \n  Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had\nreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A\nsmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed\noff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side\nof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing\nGroaci.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat\nbladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of\ndismembering me out of hand!\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.\"\n  \n \n  \"I appeal to you,\" Yith whispered hoarsely. \"As a fellow diplomat, a\nfellow alien, a fellow soft-back\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk?\" said Retief. \"Now\nkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.\"\n  \n \n  The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the\nground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was\non its back, helpless.\n  \n \n  \"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's\ncaught\u2014and why.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk came toward the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  dragging the supine Fustian, who\nkicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the\nsentry box. \"Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can\noutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.\" He stepped out and\nhailed Whonk.\n  \n \n  Puffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. \"Sleep,\nRetief!\" He panted. \"You followed a hunch; I did the same. I saw\nsomething strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. I\nwatched, followed him here. Look! It is Slock, strapped into a dead\ncarapace! Now many things become clear.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief whistled. \"So the Youths aren't all as young as they look.\nSomebody's been holding out on the rest of you Fustians!\"\n  \n \n  \"The Soft One,\" Whonk said. \"You laid him by the heels, Retief. I saw.\nProduce him now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on a minute, Whonk. It won't do you any good\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Whonk winked broadly. \"I must take my revenge!\" he roared. \"I shall\ntest the texture of the Soft One! His pulped remains will be scoured up\nby the ramp-washers and mailed home in bottles!\"\n  \n \n  Retief whirled at a sound, caught up with the scuttling Yith fifty feet\naway, hauled him back to Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"It's up to you, Whonk,\" he said. \"I know how important ceremonial\nrevenge is to you Fustians. I will not interfere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mercy!\" Yith hissed, eye-stalks whipping in distress. \"I claim\ndiplomatic immunity!\"\n  \n \n  \"No diplomat am I,\" rumbled Whonk. \"Let me see; suppose I start with\none of those obscenely active eyes\u2014\" He reached....\n  \n \n  \"I have an idea,\" said Retief brightly. \"Do you suppose\u2014just this\nonce\u2014you could forego the ceremonial revenge if Yith promised to\narrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace you elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" Whonk protested, \"those eyes! What a pleasure to pluck them, one\nby one!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yess,\" hissed Yith, \"I swear it! Our most expert surgeons ... platoons\nof them, with the finest of equipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have dreamed of how it would be to sit on this one, to feel him\nsquash beneath my bulk....\"\n  \n \n  \"Light as a whissle feather shall you dance,\" Yith whispered.\n\"Shell-less shall you spring in the joy of renewed youth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe just one eye,\" said Whonk grudgingly. \"That would leave him\nfour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Be a sport,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Well.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a deal then,\" said Retief. \"Yith, on your word as a diplomat,\nan alien, a soft-back and a skunk, you'll set up the mission. Groaci\nsurgical skill is an export that will net you more than armaments.\nIt will be a whissle feather in your cap\u2014if you bring it off. And\nin return, Whonk won't sit on you. And I won't prefer charges of\ninterference in the internal affairs of a free world.\"\n  \n \n  Behind Whonk there was a movement. Slock, wriggling free of the\nborrowed carapace, struggled to his feet ... in time for Whonk to seize\nhim, lift him high and head for the entry to the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Hey,\" Retief called. \"Where are you going?\"\n  \n \n  \"I would not deny this one his reward,\" called Whonk. \"He hoped to\ncruise in luxury. So be it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"That tub is loaded with titanite!\"\n  \n \n  \"Stand not in my way, Retief. For this one in truth owes me a\nvengeance.\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as the immense Fustian bore his giant burden up the ramp\nand disappeared within the ship.\n  \n \n  \"I guess Whonk means business,\" he said to Yith, who hung in his grasp,\nall five eyes goggling. \"And he's a little too big for me to stop.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk reappeared, alone, climbed down.\n  \n \n  \"What did you do with him?\" said Retief. \"Tell him you were going to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We had best withdraw,\" said Whonk. \"The killing radius of the drive is\nfifty yards.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The controls are set for Groaci. Long-may-he-sleep.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"It was quite a bang,\" said Retief. \"But I guess you saw it, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, confound it,\" Magnan said. \"When I remonstrated with Hulk, or\nWhelk\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Whonk.\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014the ruffian thrust me into an alley bound in my own cloak. I'll most\ncertainly complain to the Minister.\"\n  \n \n  \"How about the surgical mission?\"\n  \n \n  \"A most generous offer,\" said Magnan. \"Frankly, I was astonished. I\nthink perhaps we've judged the Groaci too harshly.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear the Ministry of Youth has had a rough morning of it,\" said\nRetief. \"And a lot of rumors are flying to the effect that Youth Groups\nare on the way out.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat, shuffled papers. \"I\u2014ah\u2014have explained to\nthe press that last night's\u2014ah\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Fiasco.\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014affair was necessary in order to place the culprits in an untenable\nposition.

        " \n  AMBITION\n  \n \n  By WILLIAM L. BADE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by L. WOROMAY\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  To the men of the future, the scientific\n   \n  goals of today were as incomprehensible\n   \n  as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!\n  \n \n \n  There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?\n  \n<doc-sep>The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n  \n \n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n  \n \n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n  \n \n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n  \n \n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n  \n \n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n  \n \n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n  \n \n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n  \n \n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n  \n \n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n  \n \n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n  \n \n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n  \n \n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n  \n \n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n  \n \n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n  \n \n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n  \n \n  \"So far. Keep talking.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Yesterday House\n  \n \n  By FRITZ LEIBER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ASHMAN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction August 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Meeting someone who's been dead for twenty\n    \n   years is shocking enough for anyone with a\n    \n   belief in ghosts\u2014worse for one with none!\n   \n \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The narrow cove was quiet as the face of an expectant child, yet so\nnear the ruffled Atlantic that the last push of wind carried the\n   \n   Annie\nO.\n   \n  its full length. The man in gray flannels and sweatshirt let the\nsail come crumpling down and hurried past its white folds at a gait\nmade comically awkward by his cramped muscles. Slowly the rocky ledge\ncame nearer. Slowly the blue V inscribed on the cove's surface by the\nsloop's prow died. Sloop and ledge kissed so gently that he hardly had\nto reach out his hand.\n  \n \n  He scrambled ashore, dipping a sneaker in the icy water, and threw the\nline around a boulder. Unkinking himself, he looked back through the\ncove's high and rocky mouth at the gray-green scattering of islands\nand the faint dark line that was the coast of Maine. He almost laughed\nin satisfaction at having disregarded vague warnings and done the thing\nevery man yearns to do once in his lifetime\u2014gone to the farthest\nisland out.\n  \n \n  He must have looked longer than he realized, because by the time he\ndropped his gaze the cove was again as glassy as if the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  had\nalways been there. And the splotches made by his sneaker on the rock\nhad faded in the hot sun. There was something very unusual about the\nquietness of this place. As if time, elsewhere hurrying frantically,\npaused here to rest. As if all changes were erased on this one bit of\nEarth.\n  \n \n  The man's lean, melancholy face crinkled into a grin at the banal\nfancy. He turned his back on his new friend, the little green sloop,\nwithout one thought for his nets and specimen bottles, and set out to\nexplore. The ground rose steeply at first and the oaks were close, but\nafter a little way things went downhill and the leaves thinned and he\ncame out on more rocks\u2014and realized that he hadn't quite gone to the\nfarthest one out.\n  \n"

One that attacked only people within the\npolitical borders of the United States!\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Illustrated by Schoenherr\n  \n \n \n  Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignored the jangling telephones and the\nexcited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line\u2014in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause\u2014by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word.\n  \n \n  \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.\n\"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bettijean crossed briskly to his desk. She gave him a motherly smile\nas she put down a thick sheaf of papers. \"You look beat,\" she said.\n\"Brass give you much trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not much. We're top priority now.\" He ran fingers through the thick,\nbrown hair and massaged his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to\nhis wary and confused brain. \"What's new?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've gone though some of these,\" she said. \"Tried to save you a\nlittle time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. Sit down.\"\n  \n \n  She pulled up a chair and thumbed through the papers. \"So far, no\nfatalities. That's why there's no panic yet, I guess. But it's\nspreading like ... well, like a plague.\" Fear flickered deep in her\ndark eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Any water reports?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"Wichita O.K., Indianapolis O.K., Tulsa O.K., Buffalo O.K.,\u2014and a\nbunch more. No indication there. Except\"\u2014she fished out a one-page\nreport\u2014\"some little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign\nfor everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today\nthey were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up at\nthe polls. They've all got it.\"\n  \n \n  Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's\na big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up\nwith a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so\nfar, thank heavens. But housewives, businessmen, office workers,\nteachers, preachers\u2014rich, poor\u2014from Florida to Alaska. Just when you\ncalled me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated\nmountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too\nfragmentary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\" he cried suddenly, banging the desk. \"People deathly\nill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until\nthey have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of\nthe country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?\"\n  \n \n  \"In food?\"\n  \n \n  \"How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing\nplants over the country. How could they all goof at the same\ntime\u2014even if it was sabotage?\"\n  \n \n  \"On the wind?\"\n  \n \n  \"But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire\ncountry\u2014even Alaska and Hawaii\u2014without hitting Canada or Mexico? And\nwhy wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to\ngrip his icy, sweating hands. \"Andy, do ... do you think it's ...\nwell, an enemy?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't know.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment he sat there, trying to draw strength from her,\npunishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his\nhead, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of\npapers.\n  \n \n  \"We've got to find a clue\u2014a trend\u2014an inkling of something.\" He\nnodded toward the outer office. \"Stop all in-coming calls. Get those\ngirls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country.\nHave them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up\nanother relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and\nsandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and\noccupation of the victims. You and I'll start with Washington.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode\nfrom the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on\nthe phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone\nand directory.\n  \n \n  He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to\nworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical\nnurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible\nscrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned\ndown to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and\nbroken lines pointed vaguely to trends.\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n"

        " \n \n  THE PLAGUE\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  By TEDDY KELLER\n  \n \n \n \n \n   Suppose a strictly one hundred per cent American plague\nshowed up.... One that attacked only people within the\npolitical borders of the United States!\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Illustrated by Schoenherr\n  \n \n \n  Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignored the jangling telephones and the\nexcited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line\u2014in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause\u2014by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word.\n  \n \n  \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.\n\"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n  \n<doc-sep>In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and\u2014. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers\u2014Aspen, Taos and college towns\u2014thousands of\npeople sick\u2014but none in that valley in Tennessee\u2014and few government\nworkers\u2014just one girl in his office\u2014and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter\u2014and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n  \n"

        "In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ...

She gave him a motherly smile\nas she put down a thick sheaf of papers. \"You look beat,\" she said.\n\"Brass give you much trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not much. We're top priority now.\" He ran fingers through the thick,\nbrown hair and massaged his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to\nhis wary and confused brain. \"What's new?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've gone though some of these,\" she said. \"Tried to save you a\nlittle time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. Sit down.\"\n  \n \n  She pulled up a chair and thumbed through the papers. \"So far, no\nfatalities. That's why there's no panic yet, I guess. But it's\nspreading like ... well, like a plague.\" Fear flickered deep in her\ndark eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Any water reports?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"Wichita O.K., Indianapolis O.K., Tulsa O.K., Buffalo O.K.,\u2014and a\nbunch more. No indication there. Except\"\u2014she fished out a one-page\nreport\u2014\"some little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign\nfor everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today\nthey were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up at\nthe polls. They've all got it.\"\n  \n \n  Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's\na big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up\nwith a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so\nfar, thank heavens. But housewives, businessmen, office workers,\nteachers, preachers\u2014rich, poor\u2014from Florida to Alaska. Just when you\ncalled me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated\nmountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too\nfragmentary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\" he cried suddenly, banging the desk. \"People deathly\nill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until\nthey have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of\nthe country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?\"\n  \n \n  \"In food?\"\n  \n \n  \"How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing\nplants over the country. How could they all goof at the same\ntime\u2014even if it was sabotage?\"\n  \n \n  \"On the wind?\"\n  \n \n  \"But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire\ncountry\u2014even Alaska and Hawaii\u2014without hitting Canada or Mexico? And\nwhy wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to\ngrip his icy, sweating hands. \"Andy, do ... do you think it's ...\nwell, an enemy?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't know.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment he sat there, trying to draw strength from her,\npunishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his\nhead, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of\npapers.\n  \n \n  \"We've got to find a clue\u2014a trend\u2014an inkling of something.\" He\nnodded toward the outer office. \"Stop all in-coming calls. Get those\ngirls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country.\nHave them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up\nanother relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and\nsandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and\noccupation of the victims. You and I'll start with Washington.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode\nfrom the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on\nthe phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone\nand directory.\n  \n \n  He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to\nworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical\nnurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible\nscrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned\ndown to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and\nbroken lines pointed vaguely to trends.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n  THE PLAGUE\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  By TEDDY KELLER\n  \n \n \n \n \n   Suppose a strictly one hundred per cent American plague\nshowed up....

He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n  \n<doc-sep>The colonel drew himself to attention, fists trembling at his sides.\n\"I'll see you hung for treason! Don't you know what Elliot Macklin\nmeans to us? Do you want those filthy Luxemburgians to reach Pluto\nbefore we do? Macklin's formula is essential to the FTL engine. You\nmight just as well have blown up Washington, D.C. Better! The capital\nis replaceable. But the chances of an Elliot Macklin are very nearly\nonce in a human race.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just a moment,\" Mitchell interrupted, \"we can cure Macklin.\"\n  \n \n  \"You\n   \n   can\n   \n  ?\" Carson said. For a moment Mitchell thought the man was\ngoing to clasp his hands and sink to his knees.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. We have learned to stabilize the virus colonies. We have\nantitoxin to combat the virus. We had always thought of it as a\nbeneficial parasite, but we can wipe it out if necessary.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good!\" Carson clasped his hands and gave at least slightly at the\nknees.\n  \n \n  \"Just you wait a second now, boys,\" Elliot Macklin said. He was leaning\nin the doorway, holding his pipe. \"I've been listening to what you've\nbeen saying and I don't like it.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean you don't like it?\" Carson demanded. He added, \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"I figure you mean to put me back like I used to be.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, doctor,\" Mitchell said eagerly, \"just as you used to be.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   With\n   \n  my headaches, like before?\"\n  \n \n  Mitchell coughed into his fist for an instant, to give him time to\nframe an answer. \"Unfortunately, yes. Apparently if your mind functions\nproperly once again you will have the headaches again. Our research is\na dismal failure.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't go that far,\" Ferris remarked cheerfully.\n  \n \n  Mitchell was about to ask his associate what he meant when he saw\nMacklin slowly shaking his head.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir!\" the mathematician said. \"I shall not go back to my original\nstate. I can remember what it was like. Always worrying, worrying,\nworrying.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean wondering,\" Mitchell said.\n  \n \n  Macklin nodded. \"Troubled, anyway. Disturbed by every little thing.\nHow high was up, which infinity was bigger than what infinity\u2014say,\nwhat was an infinity anyway? All that sort of schoolboy things. It's\npeaceful this way. My head doesn't hurt. I've got a good-looking wife\nand all the money I need. I've got it made. Why worry?\"\n  \n \n  Colonel Carson opened his mouth, then closed it.\n  \n \n  \"That's right, Colonel. There's no use in arguing with him,\" Mitchell\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It's not his decision to make,\" the colonel said. \"He's an idiot now.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Colonel. As you said, he's a moron. He seems an idiot compared to\nhis former level of intelligence but he's legally responsible. There\nare millions of morons running around loose in the United States. They\ncan get married, own property, vote, even hold office. Many of them\ndo. You can't force him into being cured.... At least, I don't\n   \n   think\n   \n  you can.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I can't. This is hardly a totalitarian state.\" The colonel looked\nmomentarily glum that it wasn't.\n  \n \n  Mitchell looked back at Macklin. \"Where did his wife get to, Colonel?\nI don't think that even previously he made too many personal decisions\nfor himself. Perhaps she could influence him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" the colonel said. \"Let's find her.\"\n  \n"

We convinced 'em otherwise.\nBut it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast\nbeef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n  \n \n  \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow\nmoney from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start\nexporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when\nyou're doing it for strangers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief\nsaid. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But\nwe need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can\nturn over to machinery\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage\nseason is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.\nFirst, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards\ncovering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens\nhere and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep\ngrass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine\nto the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on\nwho can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,\nand it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,\nthe tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:\nroast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of\nfruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's\ndone by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes\nfor the best crews.\n  \n \n  \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly\nfor the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to\nget loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are\nborn after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his\ntoes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer\nof grape juice?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers\nof heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,\nstepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at\nsight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held\nout his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face\nto face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n  \n \n  \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his\nhand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I\nstarted it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n  \n \n  \"What can I do for you?\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny.

Now I don't\nknow if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.\nArapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,\npuffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years.

Lewis\n  \n \n  Illustrated by KELLY FREAS\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  The dank air\n  of the cabin\nwas chill to Herbert Hyrel's\nnaked flesh. He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n  \n \n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses\u2014monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor\u2014had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n  \n \n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n  \n \n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n  \n \n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter\u2014hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment\u2014came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n  \n \n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n  \n \n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n  \n \n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n  \n \n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n  \n \n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n  \n \n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\n  \n \n  The Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n  \n \n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n  \n \n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n  \n \n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\n  \n \n<doc-sep>The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints\nin our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured\nman walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate\nadjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too\nmuch for us\u2014we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n  \n \n  At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with\nonly a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now\nshowing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it\nlooked good to me, like home.\n  \n \n  The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n  \n \n  I realized that I was actually\n   \n   hearing\n   \n  it for the first time.\n  \n \n  The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied\nlizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver\ntail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n  \n \n  \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be\ndangerous.\"\n  \n \n  Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be\nhostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n  \n \n  Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged\ntoward the herd.\n  \n \n  \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n  \n \n  I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At\nthe time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n  \n \n  As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except\nfor the first curious-looking one.

I'll surround him.\"\n  \n \n  The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them\nto him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck\nme violently in the face.

        " \n   A grim tale of a future in which everyone is desperate to escape\nreality, and a hero who wants to have his wine and drink it, too.\n   \n \n \n  A BOTTLE OF\n   \n \n   Old Wine\n   \n \n \n  By Richard O. Lewis\n  \n \n  Illustrated by KELLY FREAS\n  \n<doc-sep>Retief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,\ncaught it as it popped up.\n  \n \n  \"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \"You\nprobably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years\nback?\"\n  \n \n  \"Can't say that I did, Hank.\" Retief poured the black wine into two\nfresh glasses. \"Here's to the harvest.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\" Arapoulous said,\nswallowing wine. \"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.\nWe like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a\nforce. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than\nwe did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.\nBut it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's too bad,\" Retief said. \"I'd say this one tastes more like roast\nbeef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\"\n  \n \n  \"It put us in a bad spot,\" Arapoulous went on. \"We had to borrow\nmoney from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start\nexporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when\nyou're doing it for strangers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\" Retief\nsaid. \"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But\nwe need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can\nturn over to machinery\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage\nseason is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.\nFirst, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards\ncovering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens\nhere and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep\ngrass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine\nto the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on\nwho can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,\nand it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,\nthe tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:\nroast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of\nfruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's\ndone by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes\nfor the best crews.\n  \n \n  \"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly\nfor the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to\nget loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are\nborn after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his\ntoes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer\nof grape juice?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>A tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers\nof heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,\nstepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at\nsight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held\nout his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face\nto face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\n  \n \n  \"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\" the stranger said, massaging his\nhand. \"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I\nstarted it, I guess.\" He grinned and sat down.\n  \n \n  \"What can I do for you?\" Retief said.\n  \n \n  \"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were\nall ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.\nWhat I wanted to see you about was\u2014\" He shifted in his chair. \"Well,\nout on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just\nabout ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't\nknow if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Retief said. \"Have a cigar?\" He pushed a box across the desk.\nArapoulous took one. \"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\" he said,\npuffing the cigar alight. \"Only mature every twelve years. In between,\nthe vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.\nWe like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.\nApples the size of a melon\u2014and sweet\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sounds very pleasant,\" Retief said. \"Where does the Libraries and\nEducation Division come in?\"\n  \n \n  Arapoulous leaned forward. \"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks\ncan't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the\nland area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable\nforest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.\nRetief.\"\n  \n \n  \"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our\nyear's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric\norbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly\npainting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.\nLots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for\nwoodworkers. Our furniture\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I've seen some of your furniture,\" Retief said. \"Beautiful work.\"\n  \n \n  Arapoulous nodded. \"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil\nand those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then\ncomes the Monsoon. Rain\u2014it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting\ncloser. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?\nThat's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay\ninside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach\non Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.\nThe theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have\nthe music and the surf and the bonfires and stars\u2014we're close to the\ncenter of a globular cluster, you know....\"\n  \n \n  \"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the\nordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't\ntake long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new\nplaces ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a\nlot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this\nyear's different. This is Wine Year.\"\n  \n"

Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n  \n \n  The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n  \n \n  The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone\ncalled: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\"\n  \n \n  A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the\nluxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that,\nexcept for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog.\n  \n \n  Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice:\n\"Kill 'em, Brute.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it\ncertainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes\nof carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater\nand just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but\nthen my sprained ankle had got worse\u2014I kind of tried to get up and\nfell down again\u2014so he picked me up and carried me right through the\nusher.\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You\ntricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed\nyours, going through the usher.

It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Hal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in.

His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to\nretreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed\nback to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound\nissued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other\nuninjes moved uneasily.\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy\nwhispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still\nfixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.\n  \n \n  The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely\nelectrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back.\nThe Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall.\n  \n \n  \"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  The Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then\nbounced him back with equal force.\n  \n \n  \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving\nup, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell\nhow old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you\nthrough a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the\nusher.\"\n  \n"

        "Sometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway\u2014for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped\u2014and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014er\u2014you see, Joggy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  TIME IN THE ROUND\n  \n \n  By FRITZ LEIBER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by DILLON\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction May 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Poor Butcher suffered more than any dictator\n    \n   in history: everybody gave in to him because\n    \n   he was so puny and they were so impregnable!\n   \n \n \n \n  From the other end of the Avenue of Wisdom that led across the Peace\nPark, a gray, hairless, heavily built dog was barking soundlessly at\nthe towering crystal glory of the Time Theater.

        "  Saboteur of Space\n  \n \n  By ROBERT ABERNATHY\n  \n \n  Fresh power was coming to Earth, energy\n   \n  which would bring life to a dying planet.\n   \n  Only two men stood in its way, one a cowardly\n   \n  rat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns\n   \n  in a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen\n   \n  of fate\u2014and even the winner would lose.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Ryd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and\nwatched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\n  \n \n  Now he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n  \n \n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n  \n \n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n  \n \n  Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n  \n \n  \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n  \n \n  \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\n  \n \n  The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n  \n \n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\n  \n \n  The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>For some twenty minutes, he raced through a dizzying, nightmare world\nof dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet.\n  \n \n  At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence. He saw\nthat he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the\ncity.\n  \n \n  He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette.\nA thousand stars\u2014a thousand motionless balls of silver fire\u2014shone\nabove him through Luna City's transparent dome.\n  \n \n  He was sorry he'd hit Cobb, of course. He was not sorry he'd run.\nEscaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision.\n  \n \n \n   You can do two things\n   \n  , he thought.\n  \n \n \n   You can give yourself up, and that's what a good officer would do.\nThat would eliminate the escape charge. You'd get off with voluntary\nmanslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in\nprison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you'd be free.\n   \n \n \n \n   But you'd be through with rockets and space. They don't want new\nmen over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class\njet-men on beat-up freighters\u2014they don't want convicted killers. You'd\nget the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by\npeeking through electric fences of spaceports.\n   \n \n \n \n   Or\u2014\n   \n \n \n  There were old wives' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who\noperated from the Solar System's frontiers. The spacemen weren't\noutlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth.\n  \n \n  And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the\nsouped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their\nheadquarters was Venus. Their leader\u2014a subject of popular and\nfantastic conjecture in the men's audiozines\u2014was rumored to be a\nred-bearded giant.\n  \n \n \n   So\n   \n  , Ben reflected,\n   \n   you can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously.\nYou can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your\nname. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your\nduty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from\nEarth.\n   \n \n \n  After all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant\nsecond, to destroy a man's life and his dream?\n  \n<doc-sep>All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\n  \n"

        "  Saboteur of Space\n  \n \n  By ROBERT ABERNATHY\n  \n \n  Fresh power was coming to Earth, energy\n   \n  which would bring life to a dying planet.\n   \n  Only two men stood in its way, one a cowardly\n   \n  rat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns\n   \n  in a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen\n   \n  of fate\u2014and even the winner would lose.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Ryd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and\nwatched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\n  \n \n  Now he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n  \n \n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n  \n \n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n  \n \n  Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n  \n \n  \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n  \n \n  \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\n  \n \n  The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n  \n \n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\n  \n \n  The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  It all began on a Saturday\nnight at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  . If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\n  \n \n  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\n  \n \n  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n<doc-sep>They watched the parabola it made in its trajectory as it flashed into\nspace and then fell into orbit there beyond the planetary attraction of\nVenus. On the three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncannily real.\n  \n \n  A flight that had taken many hours to accomplish, was shortened on\nthe viso-screen to a matter of minutes. They saw the great, proud\ninterplanetary transport speeding majestically through the starry void,\nand suddenly, they saw her swerve in a great arc; again she swerved\nas if avoiding something deadly in space, and point upwards gaining\naltitude. It was zig-zagging now, desperately maneuvering in an erratic\ncourse, and as if by magic, a tiny spot appeared on the transport's\nside.\n  \n \n  Tiny on the viso-screen, the fatal spots must have been huge in\nactuality. To the Commander of the I.S.P., and to Captain Brooke, it\nwas an old story. Atom-blasts were pitting the spacer's hull with\ndeadly Genton shells. The great transport trembled under the impact of\nthe barrage, and suddenly, the screen went blank.\n  \n \n  Commander Bertram turned slowly to face the young I.S.P. captain, whose\nfeatures were a mask devoid of all expression now, save for the pallor\nand the burning fire in his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"And that's the sixth one in a month. Sometimes the survivors reach\nTerra in emergency spacers, or are picked up in space by other\ntransports ... and sometimes son ... well, as you know, sometimes\nthey're never seen again.\"\n  \n \n  \"When do I leave, Commander!\" Dennis Brooke's voice was like a javelin\nof ice.\n  \n \n  \"Right now, if you wish. We have a new cruiser armored in beryloid with\ndouble hull\u2014a new design against Genton shells, but it's the speed\nof the thing that you'll want to know about. It just about surpasses\nanything ever invented. Get the figures and data from the coordination\nroom, son; it's serviced and fueled and the crew's aboard.\" He\nextended his hand. \"You're the best spacer we have\u2014aside from your\nrecklessness\u2014and on your success depends far more than the capture of\nan outlaw.\" Bertram smiled thinly. \"Happy landing!\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Their nerves were ragged. Days and days of fruitless search for a\nphantom ship that seemed to have vanished from space, and an equally\nelusive pirate whose whereabouts were hidden in the depths of\nfathomless space.\n  \n \n  To all but Captain Brooke, this was a new adventure, their first\nassignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the\ninner planets, where men spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance\nagainst stray asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless vandal ships. Even\ntheir cruiser was a new experience, the long, tapering fighter lacked\nthe luxurious offices and appointments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol\nspacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was\nhoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was a\nthing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty instinct with power, not the\ncomfortable luxury that they knew.\n  \n \n  Day after day they went through their drills, donning space suits,\nmanning battle stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at empty space, and\neternally scanning the vast empty reaches by means of the telecast.\n  \n \n  And suddenly, out of the void, as they had all but given up the search\nas a wild goose chase, a speck was limned in the lighted surface of the\nviso-screen in the control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser came to\nlife. In a burst of magnificent speed, the cruiser literally devoured\nthe space leagues, until the spacer became a flashing streak. On the\nviso-screen, the speck grew larger, took on contours, growing and\nbecoming slowly the drifting shell of what had been a transport.\n  \n \n  Presently they were within reaching distance, and Captain Brooke\ncommanded through the teleradio from the control room:\n  \n \n  \"Prepare to board!\"\n  \n \n  Every member of the crew wanted to be among the boarding party, for\nall but George Randall, the junior member of the crew had served his\napprenticeship among the inner planets, Mars, Venus and Terra. He felt\nnauseated at the very thought of going out there in that vast abyss of\nspace. His young, beardless face, with the candid blue eyes went pale\nwhen the order was given. But presently, Captain Brooke named those who\nwere to go beside himself:\n  \n \n  \"You, Tom and Scotty, take one emergency plane, and Dallas!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain!\" Dallas Bernan, the immense third lieutenant boomed in\nhis basso-profundo voice.\n  \n \n  \"You and I'll take a second emergency!\" There was a pause in the voice\nof the Captain from the control room, then: \"Test space suits. Test\noxygen helmets! Atom-blasts only, ready in five minutes!\"\n  \n \n  George Randall breathed a sigh of relief. He watched them bridge the\nspace to the drifting wreck, then saw them enter what had once been a\nproud interplanetary liner, now soon to be but drifting dust, and he\nturned away with a look of shame.\n  \n \n  Inside the liner, Captain Dennis Brooke had finished making a detailed\nsurvey.\n  \n \n  \"No doubt about it,\" he spoke through the radio in his helmet. \"Cargo\nmissing. No survivors. No indication that the repulsion fields were\nout of order. And finally, those Genton shells could only have been\nfired by Koerber!\" He tried to maintain a calm exterior, but inwardly\nhe seethed in a cold fury more deadly than any he had ever experienced.\nSomehow he had expected to find at least one compartment unharmed,\nwhere life might have endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only a great\nresolve to deal with Koerber once and for all remained to him.\n  \n \n  Dennis tried not to think of Marla, too great an ache was involved in\nthinking of her and all he had lost. When he finally spoke, his voice\nwas harsh, laconic:\n  \n \n  \"Prepare to return!\"\n  \n \n  Scotty Byrnes, the cruiser's nurse, who could take his motors through a\nmajor battle, or hell and high water and back again, for that matter,\nshifted the Venusian weed that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek and\ngazed curiously at Captain Brooke. They all knew the story in various\nversions, and with special additions. But they were spacemen, implicit\nin their loyalty, and with Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe.\n  \n \n  Tom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-faced Navigator, whose slow,\neasygoing movements belied the feral persistence of a tiger, and the\nswiftness of a striking cobra in a fight, led the small procession of\nmen toward the emergency planes. Behind him came Dallas Bernan, third\nlieutenant, looming like a young asteroid in his space suit, followed\nby Scotty, and finally Captain Brooke himself. All left in silence, as\nif the tragedy that had occurred aboard the wrecked liner, had touched\nthem intimately.\n  \n"

        "All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded.

There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly.

A faint glow rose from Pi\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\nup\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\nrelief was in sight.\n  \n \n  Ryd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\ndive.\n  \n \n  The place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\n  \n \n  The rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\n  \n \n  Ryd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\nheartened.\n  \n \n  \"Say, Burshis,\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\nthat his jowls quivered.\n  \n \n  \"No loans,\" he said flatly. \"But just one on the house, Ryd.\"\n  \n \n  The drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \"What you\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Burshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \"Didn't you hear that ship\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\u2014the\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\nin again.\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\nshoulder: \"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\nJobs for all the bums in this town\u2014even for you.\"\n  \n \n  He left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\nman\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\n  \n \n  The man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Mury smiled with supernal calm. \"We won't be here long,\" he said.\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \"The central control panel and\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\"\n  \n \n  Almost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\n  \n \n  \"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd backed\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\nnervous gaze\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\n  \n \n  He saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\noutside.\n  \n \n  The inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"You damned clumsy little fool\u2014\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\nstarboard airlock.\n  \n \n  Mury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \"Ready\" to\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\nlittle cell of steel.\n  \n \n  \"It's been tried before,\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\n   \n   ex officio\n   \n  the brains\nof the vessel. \"Stealing a ship\u2014it can't be done any more.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's been done again,\" said Mury grimly. \"And you don't know the half\nof it. But\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\u2014\" The gun\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \"Out of\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\"\n  \n \n  He had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're trying to do?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think?\" demanded Mury in return. \"I'm taking the ship\ninto space. On schedule and on course\u2014to meet the power shell.\" The\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \"And as for you\u2014what's your name?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yet Arliess.\"\n  \n \n  \"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \"Why, yes,\" he\nsaid as if in wonder, \"I do.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  drove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\n  \n \n  Ryd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\u2014and Ryd had lost\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\nthe towship's keel.\n  \n \n  A single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\nengines.\n  \n \n  Mury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\n\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\" he said dryly. \"That doesn't\nmean you,\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\n  \n \n  Ryd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\nventured shakily, \"Where are we?\"\n  \n \n  Mury smiled slightly. \"Only our astrogator,\" he indicated Arliess,\nstill masked and fettered, \"can tell you that with precision. I\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\ntracks.\n  \n \n  Mury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\nlight.\n  \n \n  \"What's that, Arliess?\"\n  \n \n  The astrogator broke his silence. \"A ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know that well enough. What ship?\"\n  \n \n  \"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\nthat's the liner\n   \n   Alborak\n   \n  , out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\nfor Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Mury shook his head regretfully. \"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\ndrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" said Arliess. But his voice\nwas raw and unsteady.\n  \n \n  \"I'm talking about this. That ship is a warship, and it's looking for\nus\u2014will intercept us inside of twenty minutes at the most!\"\n  \n"

He laid a hand on\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \"So you're Ryd Randl.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned away grim-lipped and left the bridge. From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children\u2014but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained\u2014like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years\u2014though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there\u2014his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now\u2014if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed\u2014and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue\u2014that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort\u2014the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight\u2014so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Spawning Ground\n  \n \n  By LESTER DEL REY\n  \n \n  They weren't human.

She seemed to\nbe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from\nthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\nthrough her hallways.\n  \n \n  Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\na big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\nhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\nreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\nwere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\ncontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\nmoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\nneed a shave.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\nhand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\nduring the night?\"\n  \n \n  \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\nnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\nclouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\nknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\nan almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\nour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\nin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\nin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\nas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\nPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n  \n \n  Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\nseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\nand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\ntheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\non their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n  \n \n  But\n   \n   something\n   \n  had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\nback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\nup.\n  \n"

For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\nhe had ever known\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\nalmost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray\ncellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea?\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\n  \n \n  The other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\ndistinctly. \"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Huh?\n   \n  Why, yeh\u2014I guess so\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then come with me.\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\n   \n   meloderge\n   \n  that was softly pouring out its\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\n  \n \n  Outside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\nthem. They kept walking\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\n  \n \n  \"So you're Ryd Randl,\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\n\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \"Look,\" he gasped. \"If\nyou're a cop, say so!\"\n  \n \n  The other laughed shortly. \"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\u2014you\ncan call me Mury.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\"\n  \n \n  \"And why, Ryd?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\" He hunched his narrow\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \"Damn\ngood one, too\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\nphysique for Mars\u2014I might just have made it\n   \n   then\n   \n  , but I thought the\nplant was going to open again and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\nfull economic independence\u2014and domination. For power is\u2014power; and\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\n  \n \n  \"Ten years ago,\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \"That must have been the\nPower Company of North America\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \"They wouldn't take me, damn\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know all about your record,\" said Mury softly.\n  \n \n  Ryd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\nkicked-dog manner. \"How do you know? And what's it to you?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\n  \n"

        "class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  THE SERPENT RIVER\n  \n \n  By Don Wilcox\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Other Worlds May 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n<doc-sep>The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and\nwhen Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to\nthe village he had visited the day before. However, there were other\nseal-people here.\n  \n \n  And they were almost human!\n  \n \n  The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup\u2014that\nwas little changed from the first he had found\u2014as in their obviously\ngreater intelligence.\n  \n \n  This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.\nKaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he\nslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.\nWhere the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly\nalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these\nhad no odor\u2014only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet\nhim, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.\n  \n \n  Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes\nof curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.\n  \n \n  One was a female.\n  \n \n  They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he\nunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He\ntried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object,\nbut their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused\nhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was\nfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to\ncarry on a limited conversation.\n  \n \n  The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until\nKaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached\nthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.\n  \n<doc-sep>As dusk fell, Kaiser set up his tent a few hundred yards back from the\nnative settlement. All apprehension about how his stomach would react\nto the river weed had left him. Apparently it could be assimilated by\nhis digestive system. Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at\npeace with this world.\n  \n \n  Once, just before dropping off to sleep, he heard the snuffling noise\nof some large animal outside his tent and picked up a pistol, just in\ncase. However, the first jolt of the guard-wire charge discouraged the\nbeast and Kaiser heard it shuffle away, making puzzled mewing sounds as\nit went.\n  \n \n  The next morning, Kaiser left off all his clothes except a pair of\nshorts and went swimming in the river. The seal-people were already in\nthe water when he arrived and were very friendly.\n  \n \n  That friendliness nearly resulted in disaster. The natives crowded\naround as he swam\u2014they maneuvered with an otter-like proficiency\u2014and\noften nudged him with their bodies when they came too close. He had\ndifficulty keeping afloat and soon turned and started back. As he\nneared the river edge, a playful female grabbed him by the ankle and\npulled him under.\n  \n \n  Kaiser tried to break her hold, but she evidently thought he was\nclowning and wrapped her warm furred arms around him and held him\nhelpless. They sank deeper.\n  \n \n  When his breath threatened to burst from his lungs in a stream of\nbubbles, and he still could not free himself, Kaiser brought his knee\nup into her stomach and her grip loosened abruptly. He reached the\nsurface, choking and coughing, and swam blindly toward shore until his\nfeet hit the river bottom.\n  \n \n  As he stood on the bank, getting his breath, the natives were quiet and\nseemed to be looking at him reproachfully. He stood for a time, trying\nto think of a way to explain the necessity of what he had done, but\nthere was none. He shrugged helplessly.\n  \n \n  There was no longer anything to be gained by staying here\u2014if they\nhad the tools he needed, he had no way of finding out or asking for\nthem\u2014and he packed and started back to the scout.\n  \n \n  Kaiser's good spirits returned on his return journey. He had enjoyed\nthe relief from the tedium of spending day after day in the scout, and\nnow he enjoyed the exercise of pulling the mudsled. Above the waist,\nhe wore only the harness and the large, soft drops of rain against his\nbare skin were pleasant to feel.\n  \n \n  When he reached the scout, Kaiser began to unload the sled. The\ntarpaulin caught on the edge of a runner and he gave it a tug to free\nit. To his amazement, the heavy sled turned completely over, spilling\nthe equipment to the ground.\n  \n \n  Perplexed, Kaiser stooped and began replacing the spilled articles in\nthe tarp. They felt exceptionally light. He paused again, and suddenly\nhis eyes widened.\n  \n"

        "class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  3.\n  \n \n  They were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends.\nThey charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird\nclubs with a threat of death.\n  \n \n  Wild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n  \n \n  \"Captain\u2014\n   \n   Jim\n   \n  ! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n  \n \n  Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell\u2014to do something\u2014anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n  \n \n  Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n  \n \n  \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split\n   \n   could\n   \n  drop his\ndignity under excitement\u2014his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n  \n \n  We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n  \n \n  \"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  Split touched the number sixteen signal.\n  \n \n  The ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n  \n \n  You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n  \n \n  \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n  \n \n  Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few\u2014the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group\u2014came with him.\n  \n \n  \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n  \n \n  Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n  \n \n  We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n  \n \n  Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n  \n \n  Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth\u2014handsome\u2014attractive.\"\n  \n \n  Then the siren went off.\n  \n \n  The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n  \n \n  I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n  \n \n  \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n  \n \n  Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n  \n \n  We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n  \n \n  Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n  \n \n  By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose\u2014to\nunderstand the Serpent River\u2014would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course\u2014these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n  \n \n  Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n  \n \n  \"Wollo\u2014yeeta\u2014vo\u2014vandartch\u2014vandartch! Grr\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\"\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o,\" one of the others echoed.\n  \n \n  It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\"\nwe were all safe.\n  \n \n  Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"\n   \n   See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n  \n \n  Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n  \n \n  I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n  \n \n  The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n  \n \n  Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na\n   \n   warning\n   \n  ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n  \n \n  I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip\u2014BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened\u2014and those who were able, ran.\n  \n \n  They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n  \n \n  But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n  \n \n  His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it\u2014and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him\u2014apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n  \n \n  I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.\n  \n<doc-sep>Six days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\noutpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\nthe eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\nwater. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\nsky like puffs of cotton.\n  \n \n  We had traveled this far by\n   \n   ganet\n   \n  , the tough little two headed pack\nanimal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\nhad its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\nbelt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to\nboatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\n   \n   jagua\n   \n  canoes.\n  \n \n  It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\nconfidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\n  \n \n  \"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\nEzra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to\nthe lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\nsee, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\nship.\"\n  \n \n  Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\ntossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\nsteadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\njust before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\nthat broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\nisolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\ngiven me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\ncoming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\nrepresentative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\nto find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\n  \n \n  Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\ntent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\nGrannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\nwhich she had skilfully blended into a novel?\n  \n \n  Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\nplace a ringing silence blanketed everything.\n  \n \n  And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\nundulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\nit advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\nIt charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\nThere was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\ntalons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\nmissing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\n  \n \n  From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\nappeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\n  \n \n  \"Stand still!\"\n  \n \n  The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\nagain. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\npurple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\nair. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\nground and shot aloft.\n  \n \n \n \n   Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\n   \n \n \n \n  I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, what was it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\nin the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\ntrained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\nand follows with a relentless purpose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then that would mean...?\"\n  \n \n  \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\ncafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\ntent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\nbeing watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  THE SERPENT RIVER\n  \n \n  By Don Wilcox\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Other Worlds May 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n"

Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n  \n \n  \"Captain\u2014\n   \n   Jim\n   \n  ! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n  \n \n  Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell\u2014to do something\u2014anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n  \n \n  Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n  \n \n  \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split\n   \n   could\n   \n  drop his\ndignity under excitement\u2014his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n  \n \n  We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n  \n \n  \"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  Split touched the number sixteen signal.\n  \n \n  The ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n  \n \n  You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n  \n \n  \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n  \n \n  Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few\u2014the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group\u2014came with him.\n  \n \n  \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n  \n \n  Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n  \n \n  We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n  \n \n  Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n  \n \n  Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth\u2014handsome\u2014attractive.\"\n  \n \n  Then the siren went off.\n  \n \n  The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n  \n \n  I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n  \n \n  \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n  \n \n  Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n  \n \n  We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n  \n \n  Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n  \n \n  By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose\u2014to\nunderstand the Serpent River\u2014would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course\u2014these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n  \n \n  Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n  \n \n  \"Wollo\u2014yeeta\u2014vo\u2014vandartch\u2014vandartch! Grr\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\"\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o,\" one of the others echoed.\n  \n \n  It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\"\nwe were all safe.\n  \n \n  Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"\n   \n   See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n  \n \n  Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n  \n \n  I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n  \n \n  The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n  \n \n  Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na\n   \n   warning\n   \n  ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n  \n \n  I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip\u2014BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened\u2014and those who were able, ran.\n  \n \n  They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n  \n \n  But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n  \n \n  His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it\u2014and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him\u2014apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n  \n \n  I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.\n  \n<doc-sep>Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\nimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know\nwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\nwiggled in anticipation.\n  \n \n  He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\nit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\nsurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\nNever before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\nprotect himself.\n  \n \n  He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\nattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\nhad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\ninto the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n  \n \n  The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\nand at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\nHe picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\nfew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\nto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\ndeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n  \n \n  \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n  \n \n  \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's\nall. Now pick him up.\"\n  \n \n  The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.\nWhat had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\nagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\npower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\nfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\ndirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\nordered the stoppage of time.\n  \n \n  The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\nmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\ntransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\nhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\nto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\nwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\nhe might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\nin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\nend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.\nHe hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\nhissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\nBefore starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\nto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\nexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\nstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\nthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n  \n \n  Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\ntorn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\ncountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\nanimals.\n  \n \n  Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\nwith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\nwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit\ninto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\nlong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\ndidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\nfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\nabused this faculty.\n  \n"

        "Knof Llud, the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  captain, came slowly down the narrow\nstair from the observatory, into the big rotunda that was now the main\nrecreation room, where most of the people gathered. The great chamber,\na full cross-section of the vessel, had been at first a fuel hold. At\nthe voyage's beginning eighty per cent of the fifteen-hundred-foot\ncylinder had been engines and fuel; but as the immense stores were\nspent and the holds became radioactively safe, the crew had spread\nout from its original cramped quarters. Now the interstellar ship was\nlittle more than a hollow shell.\n  \n \n  Eyes lifted from the vision screens to interrogate Knof Llud; he met\nthem with an impassive countenance, and announced quietly, \"We've\nsighted Earth.\"\n  \n \n  A feverish buzz arose; the captain gestured for silence and went on,\n\"It is still only a featureless disk to the telescope. Zost Relyul has\nidentified it\u2014no more.\"\n  \n \n  But this time the clamor was not to be settled. People pressed round\nthe screens, peering into them as if with the naked eye they could\npick out the atom of reflected light that was Earth, home. They wrung\neach other's hands, kissed, shouted, wept. For the present their fears\nwere forgotten and exaltation prevailed.\n  \n \n  Knof Llud smiled wryly. The rest of the little speech he had been about\nto make didn't matter anyway, and it might have spoiled this moment.\n  \n \n  He turned to go, and was halted by the sight of his wife, standing at\nhis elbow. His wry smile took on warmth; he asked, \"How do\n   \n   you\n   \n  feel,\nLesra?\"\n  \n \n  She drew an uncertain breath and released it in a faint sigh. \"I don't\nknow. It's good that Earth's still there.\" She was thinking, he judged\nshrewdly, of Knof Jr. and Delza, who save from pictures could not\nremember sunlit skies or grassy fields or woods in summer....\n  \n \n  He said, with a touch of tolerant amusement, \"What did you think might\nhave happened to Earth? After all, it's only been nine hundred years.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's just it,\" said Lesra shakily. \"Nine hundred years have gone\nby\u2014\n   \n   there\n   \n  \u2014and nothing will be the same. It won't be the same world\nwe left, the world we knew and fitted in....\"\n  \n \n  The captain put an arm round her with comforting pressure. \"Don't\nworry. Things may have changed\u2014but we'll manage.\" But his face had\nhardened against registering the gnawing of that same doubtful fear\nwithin him. He let his arm fall. \"I'd better get up to the bridge.\nThere's a new course to be set now\u2014for Earth.\"\n  \n \n  He left her and began to climb the stairway again. Someone switched\noff the lights, and a charmed whisper ran through the big room as the\npeople saw each other's faces by the pale golden light of Earth's own\nSun, mirrored and multiplied by the screens. In that light Lesra's eyes\ngleamed with unshed tears.\n  \n \n  Captain Llud found Navigator Gwar Den looking as smug as the cat\nthat ate the canary. Gwar Den was finding that the actual observed\npositions of the planets thus far located agreed quite closely with\nhis extrapolations from long unused charts of the Solar System. He had\nalready set up on the calculator a course that would carry them to\nEarth.\n  \n \n  Llud nodded curt approval, remarking, \"Probably we'll be intercepted\nbefore we get that far.\"\n  \n \n  Den was jolted out of his happy abstraction. \"Uh, Captain,\" he said\nhesitantly. \"What kind of a reception do you suppose we'll get?\"\n  \n \n  Llud shook his head slowly. \"Who knows? We don't know whether any\nof the other\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  returned successful, or if they returned at\nall. And we don't know what changes have taken place on Earth. It's\npossible\u2014not likely, though\u2014that something has happened to break\ncivilization's continuity to the point where our expedition has been\nforgotten altogether.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They were there for three days. They were delighted with the place.\nIt was a world with everything, and it seemed to have only two\ninhabitants. They went everywhere except into the big cave.\n  \n \n  \"What is there, Adam?\" asked Captain Stark.\n  \n \n  \"The great serpent lives there. I would not disturb him. He has long\nbeen cranky because plans he had for us did not materialize. But we\nare taught that should ever evil come to us, which it cannot if we\npersevere, it will come by him.\"\n  \n \n  They learned no more of the real nature of the sphere in their time\nthere. Yet all but one of them were convinced of the reality when they\nleft. And they talked of it as they took off.\n  \n \n  \"A crowd would laugh if told of it,\" said Stark, \"but not many would\nlaugh if they had actually seen the place, or them. I am not a gullible\nman, but I am convinced of this: that this is a pristine and pure world\nand that ours and all the others we have visited are fallen worlds.\nHere are the prototypes of our first parents before their fall. They\nare garbed in light and innocence, and they have the happiness that\nwe have been seeking for centuries.

        "class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  \"Split\" Campbell and I brought our ship down to a quiet landing on the\nsummit of a mile-wide naked rock, and I turned to the telescope for a\ncloser view of the strange thing we had come to see.\n  \n \n  It shone, eighteen or twenty miles away, in the light of the late\nafternoon sun. It was a long silvery serpent-like\n   \n   something\n   \n  that\ncrawled slowly over the planet's surface.\n  \n \n  There was no way of guessing how large it was, at this distance. It\nmight have been a rope rolled into shape out of a mountain\u2014or a chain\nof mountains. It might have been a river of bluish-gray dough that had\nshaped itself into a great cable. Its diameter? If it had been a hollow\ntube, cities could have flowed through it upright without bending their\nskyscrapers. It was, to the eye, an endless rope of cloud oozing along\nthe surface of the land. No, not cloud, for it had the compactness of\nsolid substance.\n  \n \n  We could see it at several points among the low foothills. Even from\nthis distance we could guess that it had been moving along its course\nfor centuries. Moving like a sluggish snake. It followed a deep-worn\npath between the nearer hills and the high jagged mountains on the\nhorizon.\n  \n \n \n   What was it?\n   \n \n \n  \"Split\" Campbell and I had been sent here to learn the answers.\nOur sponsor was the well known \"EGGWE\" (the Earth-Galaxy Good\nWill Expeditions.) We were under the EGGWE Code. We were the first\nexpedition to this planet, but we had come equipped with two important\npieces of advance information. The Keynes-Roy roving cameras (unmanned)\nhad brought back to the Earth choice items of fact about various parts\nof the universe. From these photos we knew (1) that man lived on this\nplanet, a humanoid closely resembling the humans of the Earth; and\n(2) that a vast cylindrical \"rope\" crawled the surface of this land,\ncontinuously, endlessly.\n  \n \n  We had intentionally landed at what we guessed would be a safe distance\nfrom the rope. If it were a living thing, like a serpent, we preferred\nnot to disturb it. If it gave off heat or poisonous gases or deadly\nvibrations, we meant to keep our distance. If, on the other hand, it\nproved to be some sort of vegetable\u2014a vine of glacier proportions\u2014or\na river of some silvery, creamy substance\u2014we would move in upon it\ngradually, gathering facts as we progressed. I could depend upon\n\"Split\" to record all observable phenomena with the accuracy of\nsplit-hairs.\n  \n \n  Split was working at the reports like a drudge at this very moment.\n  \n \n  I looked up from the telescope, expecting him to be waiting his turn\neagerly. I misguessed. He didn't even glance up from his books. Rare\nyoung Campbell! Always a man of duty, never a man of impulse!\n  \n \n  \"Here Campbell, take a look at the 'rope'.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before I finish the reports, sir? If I recall our Code, Section Two,\nOrder of Duties upon Landing: A\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Forget the Code. Take a look at the rope while the sun's on it.... See\nit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Can you see it's moving? See the little clouds of dust coming up from\nunder its belly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir. An excellent view, Captain Linden.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you think of it, Split? Ever see a sight like that before?\"\n  \n \n  \"No sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what about it? Any comments?\"\n  \n \n  Split answered me with an enthusiastic, \"By gollies, sir!\" Then, with\nrestraint, \"It's precisely what I expected from the photographs, sir.\nAny orders, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Relax, Split! That's the order. Relax!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks\u2014thanks, Cap!\" That was his effort to sound informal, though\ncoming from him it was strained. His training had given him an\nexaggerated notion of the importance of dignity and discipline.\n  \n \n  He was naturally so conscientious it was painful. And to top it all,\nhis scientific habit of thought made him want to stop and weigh his\nwords even when speaking of casual things such as how much sugar he\nrequired in his coffee.\n  \n \n  Needless to say, I had kidded him unmercifully over these traits.\nAcross the millions of miles of space that we had recently traveled\n(our first voyage together) I had amused myself at his expense. I\nhad sworn that he would find, in time, that he couldn't even trim\nhis fingernails without calipers, or comb his hair without actually\nphysically splitting the hairs that cropped up in the middle of the\npart. That was when I had nicknamed him \"Split\"\u2014and the wide ears that\nstuck out from his stubble-cut blond hair had glowed with the pink of\nselfconsciousness. Plainly, he liked the kidding. But if I thought I\ncould rescue him from the weight of dignity and duty, I was mistaken.\n  \n \n  Now he had turned the telescope for a view far to the right. He paused.\n  \n \n  \"What do you see?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot say definitely. The exact scientific classification of the\nobject I am observing would call for more detailed scrutiny\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're seeing some sort of object?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of object?\"\n  \n \n  \"A living creature, sir\u2014upright, wearing clothes\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   man\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"To all appearances, sir\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You bounder, give me that telescope!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  3.\n  \n \n  They were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends.\nThey charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird\nclubs with a threat of death.\n  \n \n  Wild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we\nwere about to witness a massacre.\n  \n \n  \"Captain\u2014\n   \n   Jim\n   \n  ! You're not going to let this happen!\"\n  \n \n  Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had\nthe same impulse as Campbell\u2014to do something\u2014anything! Yet here we\nsat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty\n\"friends\" in danger.\n  \n \n  Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't\nduck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and\npacked themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall.\n  \n \n  \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split\n   \n   could\n   \n  drop his\ndignity under excitement\u2014his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he\nwanted any sort of split-second order.\n  \n \n  We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and\nweaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They\nwere closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party.\n  \n \n  \"Jim, can we shoot?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\"\n  \n \n  Split touched the number sixteen signal.\n  \n \n  The ship's siren wailed out over the land.\n  \n \n  You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones\nsuddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you\never saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren\nscream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The\nattackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life.\nIt jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept\nright on singing.\n  \n \n  \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got\ninto it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party\nhad behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our\ndirection from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make\nout the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately,\nhe marched over the hilltop toward us.\n  \n \n  Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding\nplaces in the ground. But a few\u2014the brave ones, perhaps, or the\nofficials of his group\u2014came with him.\n  \n \n  \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled.\n  \n \n  Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I\nsaid. Together we descended from the ship.\n  \n \n  We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first.\nWe slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be\none-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively.\nWe didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still\nretreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And\nin case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket\narsenal of special purpose capsule bombs.\n  \n \n  Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the\ncream-and-red cloak.\n  \n \n  Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against\nthe siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces.\nLike the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down\nany main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass.\n\"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\"\n\"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very\nsmooth\u2014handsome\u2014attractive.\"\n  \n \n  Then the siren went off.\n  \n \n  The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be\nwaiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in\nclose.\n  \n \n  I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come\nequipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing\nmedallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a\nlarge silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear,\ndainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\"\n  \n \n  As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own\nneck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was\nnot overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it\nwas, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I\nliked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to\nplace the gift around his neck.\n  \n \n  \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n  \n \n  Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud,\n\"Tomboldo.\"\n  \n \n  We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then,\nas the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each\nbreathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of\nthem. One was Gravgak.\n  \n \n  Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did\nnot know these people's expressions well enough to be sure.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were\npainted with green and black diamond designs.\n  \n \n  By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were\ninvited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we\nwould be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of\nTomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose\u2014to\nunderstand the Serpent River\u2014would be forwarded greatly if we could\nlearn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the\nriver's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and\nto map its course\u2014these facts were only a part of the information we\nsought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this\nplanet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends\nthey may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when\nfuture expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE)\nfor an extension of peaceful trade relationships.\n  \n \n  Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was\nsafe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees\nthat had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we\nknew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent.\nOur ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests\nof Tomboldo.\n  \n \n  Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to\nhear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored\nthe growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with\nagitated jabbering:\n  \n \n  \"Wollo\u2014yeeta\u2014vo\u2014vandartch\u2014vandartch! Grr\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\"\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o,\" one of the others echoed.\n  \n \n  It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The\nenemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a\nwholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\"\nwe were all safe.\n  \n \n  Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment\njacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than\na yowling siren.\n  \n \n  \"See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand.\nThey must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path.\n\"\n   \n   See\u2014o\u2014see\u2014o!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees\ncame rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They\nbounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them.\n  \n \n  Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No\ndeliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies\ngleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the\nnearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed.\nShouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the\nair.\n  \n \n  I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing\nsponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits.\n  \n \n  The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came\nforward, rushing defiantly.\n  \n \n  Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their\nclubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party\nit must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet\nthe gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as\na\n   \n   warning\n   \n  ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these\nstrange devils will throw fire at you.\n  \n \n  I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders,\nthank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip,\nzip\u2014BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the\nrocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four\nwarriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were\nflattened\u2014and those who were able, ran.\n  \n \n  They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to\npick up their clubs.\n  \n \n  But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a serious\ncasualty. The guard Gravgak. He had rushed out too far, and the first\nblast of fire and rock had knocked him down. Now Tomboldo and others of\nthe party hovered over him.\n  \n \n  His eyes opened a little. I thought he was staring at me, drilling me\nwith suspicion. I worked over him with medicines. The crowd around us\nstood back in an attitude of awe as Split and I applied ready bandages,\nand held a stimulant to his nostrils that made him breath back to\nconsciousness.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he came to life. Lying there on his back, with the club still\nat his fingertips, he swung up on one elbow. The swift motion caused\na cry of joy from the crowd. I heard a little of it\u2014and then blacked\nout. For as the muscular Gravgak moved, his fingers closed over the\nhandle of the club. It whizzed upward with him\u2014apparently all by\naccident. The stone that dangled from the end of the club crashed into\nmy head.\n  \n \n  I went into instant darkness. Darkness, and a long, long silence.\n  \n<doc-sep>His friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach\nand pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over\nPurnie as sounds came from the animal.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!\nWhat's happening?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man\u2014I saw it, too. We're either\ncrazy or those damn logs are alive!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not the logs. How about us? How'd we get out of the water? Miles,\nwe're both cracking.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm telling you, man, it's the logs, or rocks or whatever they are.\nI was looking right at them. First they're on top of me, then they're\npiled up over there!\"\n  \n \n  \"Damnit, the logs didn't pick us up out of the ocean, did they? Captain\nBenson!\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you men all right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes sir, but\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Who saw exactly what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid we're not seeing right, Captain. Those logs\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I know, I know. Now get hold of yourselves. We've got to round up the\nothers and get out of here while time is on our side.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what happened, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell, Rhodes, don't you think I'd like to know? Those logs are so old\nthey're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would\ntake super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so\nbusy eating seaweed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can't\nwalk. Where's Forbes?\"\n  \n \n  \"He's sitting down there in the water, Captain, crying like a baby. Or\nlaughing. I can't tell which.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll have to get him. Miles, Schick, come along. Forbes! You all\nright?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ho-ho-ho! Seventeen! Seventeen! Seventeen planets, Benson, and they'll\ndo anything I say! This one's got a mind of its own. Did you see that\nlittle trick with the rocks? Ho-ho!\"\n  \n \n  \"See if you can find his gun, Schick; he'll either kill himself or one\nof us. Tie his hands and take him back to the ship. We'll be along\nshortly.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hah-hah-hah! Seventeen! Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible\nfor this. Hee-hee!\"\n  \n"

        " \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU\n   \n  can alter the course of your life!\n  \n \n  Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages!\n  \n \n  The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth\n  \n \n  POSAT\n  \n \n  an ancient secret society\n  \n \n  Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n"

        " \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU\n   \n  can alter the course of your life!\n  \n \n  Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages!\n  \n \n  The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth\n  \n \n  POSAT\n  \n \n  an ancient secret society\n  \n \n  Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n"

        "Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n  \n \n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n  \n \n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n  \n \n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n  \n \n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n  \n \n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n  \n \n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n  \n \n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n  \n \n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n  \n \n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n  \n \n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n  \n \n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n  \n \n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Don stared at the scene below him.

There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n"

        " \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU\n   \n  can alter the course of your life!\n  \n \n  Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages!\n  \n \n  The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth\n  \n \n  POSAT\n  \n \n  an ancient secret society\n  \n \n  Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room.

She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Don stared at the scene below him. After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection\u2014which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today. POSAT is actually what our advertisements\nclaim\u2014an\n   \n   ancient\n   \n  secret society. Our founder has been dead for over\nfour centuries.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you said that he designed your atomic reactor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations\u2014although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries\u2014developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet\u2014there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n  \n"

        " \n  What is POSAT?\n  \n \n  By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course coming events cast their shadows\n   \n  before, but this shadow was 400 years long!\n  \n \n \n  The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several\nmagazines:\n  \n \n  MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS!\n  \n \n  What is the secret source of those profound\n   \n  principles that can solve the problems of life?\n   \n  Send for our FREE booklet of explanation.\n  \n \n  Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU\n   \n  can alter the course of your life!\n  \n \n  Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages!\n  \n \n  The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth\n  \n \n  POSAT\n  \n \n  an ancient secret society\n  \n \n  Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all,\nsimilar to the many that had appeared through the years under the\nname of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the\nfamiliar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and\nmildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip\nthe attached coupon and send for the booklet\u2014sometime\u2014when a pen or\npencil was nearer at hand.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of\n   \n   Your\nLife and Psychology\n   \n  that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus.\nHe filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil.\n\"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly\nliked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe\nit. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he\nhad, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time.\n  \n \n  Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement\nwas unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine.\nThe radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always\nliked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading\nwould be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what\nthe cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said.\n  \n \n  It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the\n   \n   Antivivisectionist Gazette\n   \n  the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT\nad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having\nfilled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that\nwould take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post\nit as soon as possible.\n  \n \n  Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at\nthe bottom of a column in\n   \n   The Bulletin of Physical Research\n   \n  . He was\nengrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired\nfrom the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research\nworker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT\nad with the disregard accorded to any common object.\n  \n \n  He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that\nsome component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his\nbrain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that\ncouldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page.\n  \n \n  It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his\nattention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small\nblack circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr\natom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the\nprinted matter that accompanied it.\n  \n \n  \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter\nwas conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted\nit in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted\nlines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it.\nHe addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and\npromptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was\nentrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his\nother letters.\n  \n \n  Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in\nresponse to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information\nthan had the original advertisement, but with considerable more\nvolubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the\nkey that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself\u2014if he would\nmerely fill out the enclosed form.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for\nseveral days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had\nmentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he\nhad watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were\nalmost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by\nsomething supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope.\n  \n \n  He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay\nheavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested\ninformation\u2014about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his\nreason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without\nquite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some\nof his desperation and sense of futility.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical\ncomposition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the\ninformation that she wished to give\u2014all about her poor, dear father\nwho had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt\ntoward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were\nreincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a\nreligion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete\nand absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their\nbooklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately.\nFortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial\nsituation.\n  \n \n  To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that\nPOSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in\nhis employment or financial position? It also served to increase his\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty,\nhanding her the booklet and questionnaire.\n  \n \n  \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as\nshe usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's\nthat you won't stop until you find out!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she\nsuggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our\nmoney. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with\ncorrect answers!\"\n  \n \n  \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your\nimagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give\nfor your reasons for asking about POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest\npocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script.\n  \n \n  It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the\ncontents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of\nPOSAT the following week. For this time they differed.\n  \n \n  Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed\ngave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They\nwere couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no\nhelp to him.\n  \n \n  His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he\nhad unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap.\nWhen he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a\nposition had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older\nindustrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place\nto work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was\nhope for the future.\n  \n \n  It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the\nother side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind\nalley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence\nin them.\n  \n \n  Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not\nonly several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that\none of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it\ncontained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and\nblack enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an\nactive member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month;\nplease remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled\ncontentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats.\n  \n \n  After a while she began to read aloud so that her own cats could enjoy\nit, too.\n  \n \n  Don Alford would not have been surprised if his envelope had shown\ncontents similar to the ones that the others received. The folded\nsheets of paper that he pulled forth, however, made him stiffen with\nsharp surprise.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Come here a minute, Betty,\" he called, spreading them out carefully on\nthe dining room table. \"What do you make of these?\"\n  \n \n  She came, dish cloth in hand, and thoughtfully examined them, one by\none. \"Multiple choice questions! It looks like a psychological test of\nsome sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't the kind of thing I expected them to send me,\" worried\nDon. \"Look at the type of thing they ask. 'If you had discovered\na new and virulent poison that could be compounded from common\nhousehold ingredients, would you (1) publish the information in a\ndaily newspaper, (2) manufacture it secretly and sell it as rodent\nexterminator, (3) give the information to the armed forces for use\nas a secret weapon, or (4) withhold the information entirely as too\ndangerous to be passed on?'\"\n  \n \n  \"Could they be a spy ring?\" asked Betty. \"Subversive agents? Anxious to\nfind out your scientific secrets like that classified stuff that you're\nso careful of when you bring it home from the lab?\"\n  \n \n  Don scanned the papers quickly. \"There's nothing here that looks like\nan attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them nothing about\nmy work except that I do research in physics. They don't even know\nwhat company I work for. If this is a psychological test, it measures\nattitudes, nothing else. Why should they want to know my attitudes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose that POSAT is really what it claims to be\u2014a secret\nsociety\u2014and that they actually screen their applicants?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled wryly. \"Wouldn't it be interesting if I didn't make the grade\nafter starting out to expose their racket?\"\n  \n \n  He pulled out his pen and sat down to the task of resolving the\ndilemmas before him.\n  \n \n  His next communication from POSAT came to his business address and,\nparadoxically, was more personal than its forerunners.\n  \n \n  Dear Doctor Alford:\n  \n \n  We have examined with interest the information that you have sent to\nus. We are happy to inform you that, thus far, you have satisfied the\nrequirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After\nTruth. Before accepting new members into this ancient and honorable\nsecret society, we find it desirable that they have a personal\ninterview with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand\nChairman on Tuesday, July 10, at 2:30 P.M. Please let us know if this\narrangement is acceptable to you. If not, we will attempt to make\nanother appointment for you.\n  \n \n  The time specified for the appointment was hardly a convenient one\nfor Don. At 2:30 P.M. on most Tuesdays, he would be at work in the\nlaboratory. And while his employers made no complaint if he took his\nresearch problems home with him and worried over them half the night,\nthey were not equally enthusiastic when he used working hours for\npursuing unrelated interests. Moreover, the headquarters of POSAT was\nin a town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a\nwhole day off for chasing will-o-wisps?\n  \n \n  It hardly seemed worth the trouble. He wondered if Betty would be\ndisappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the letter had been\nsent to the laboratory instead of his home, he couldn't consult her\nabout it without telephoning.\n  \n \n \n   Since the letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home!\n   \n  But it was impossible!\n  \n \n  He searched feverishly through his pile of daily mail for the\nenvelope in which the letter had come. The address stared up at him,\nunmistakably and fearfully legible. The name of his company. The number\nof the room he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given\nthem!\n  \n \n  \"Get hold of yourself,\" he commanded his frightened mind. \"There's some\nperfectly logical, easy explanation for this. They looked it up in the\ndirectory of the Institute of Physics. Or in the alumni directory of\nthe university. Or\u2014or\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But the more he thought about it, the more sinister it seemed. His\nlaboratory address was available, but why should POSAT take the trouble\nof looking it up? Some prudent impulse had led him to withhold that\nparticular bit of information, yet now, for some reason of their own,\nPOSAT had unearthed the information.\n  \n \n  His wife's words echoed in his mind, \"Could they be a spy ring?\nSubversive agents?\"\n  \n \n  Don shook his head as though to clear away the confusion. His\nconservative habit of thought made him reject that explanation as too\nmelodramatic.\n  \n \n  At least one decision was easier to reach because of his doubts. Now he\nknew he had to keep his appointment with the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He scribbled a memo to the department office stating that he would not\nbe at work on Tuesday.\n  \n<doc-sep>Don's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm\nof possibility.\n  \n \n  But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements spread\nbefore him.\n  \n \n  \"Four hundred years!\" he murmured with awe. \"You've had four hundred\nyears head-start on the rest of the world! What wonders you must have\nuncovered in that time!\"\n  \n \n  \"Our technical achievements may disappoint you,\" warned Crandon.\n\"Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've\nundoubtedly noticed the shielding material on the reactor. That's a\nfairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are\nother things in the laboratory that I can't even explain to you until\nyou have caught up on the technical basis for understanding them.\n  \n \n  \"Our emphasis has not been on physical sciences, however, except as\nthey contribute to our central project. We want to change civilization\nso that it can use physical science without disaster.\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Don had been fired with enthusiasm. But at these words his\nheart sank.\n  \n \n  \"Then you've failed,\" he said bitterly. \"In spite of centuries of\nadvance warning, you've failed to change the rest of us enough to\nprevent us from trying to blow ourselves off the Earth. Here we are,\nstill snarling and snapping at our neighbors' throats\u2014and we've caught\nup with you. We have the atomic bomb. What's POSAT been doing all that\ntime? Or have you found that human nature really can't be changed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me,\" said Crandon.\n  \n \n  He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, then down a\nsteep flight of stairs. He opened a door at the bottom, and Don saw\nwhat must have been the world's largest computing machine.\n  \n \n  \"This is our answer,\" said Crandon. \"Oh, rather, it's the tool by which\nwe find our answer. For two centuries we have been working on the\nnewest of the sciences\u2014that of human motivation. Soon we will be ready\nto put some of our new knowledge to work. But you are right in one\nrespect, we are working now against time. We must hurry if we are to\nsave our civilization. That's why you are here. We have work for you to\ndo. Will you join us, Don?\"\n  \n \n  \"But why the hocus-pocus?\" asked Don. \"Why do you hide behind such a\nweird front as POSAT? Why do you advertise in magazines and invite just\nanyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have work\nfor me to do? And if you really have the answers to our problems, why\nhaven't you gathered together all the scientists in the world to work\non this project\u2014before it's too late?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon took a sighing breath. \"How I wish that we could do just that!\nBut you forget that one of the prime purposes of our organization is\nto maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they can be safely\ndisclosed. We must be absolutely certain that anyone who enters this\nbuilding will have joined POSAT before he leaves. What if we approached\nthe wrong scientist? Centuries of accomplishment might be wasted if\nthey attempted either to reveal it or to exploit it!\n  \n \n  \"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before you were\ninvited here? We fed the answers to this machine and, as a result, we\nknow more about how you will react in any given situation than you do\nyourself. Even if you should fail to join us, our secrets would be\nsafe with you. Of course, we miss a few of the scientists who might\nbe perfect material for our organization. You'd be surprised, though,\nat how clever our advertisements are at attracting exactly the men we\nwant. With the help of our new science, we have baited our ads well,\nand we know how to maintain interest. Curiosity is, to the men we want,\na powerful motivator.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what about the others?\" asked Don. \"There must be hundreds of\napplicants who would be of no use to you at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes,\" replied Crandon. \"There are the mild religious fanatics. We\nenroll them as members and keep them interested by sending pamphlets in\nline with their interests. We even let them contribute to our upkeep,\nif they seem to want to. They never get beyond the reception room if\nthey come to call on us. But they are additional people through whom we\ncan act when the time finally comes.\n  \n \n  \"There are also the desperate people who try POSAT as a last\nresort\u2014lost ones who can't find their direction in life. For them we\nput into practice some of our newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate\nthem\u2014anonymously, of course. Even find jobs or patch up homes. It's\ngood practice for us.\n  \n \n  \"I think I've answered most of your questions, Don. But you haven't\nanswered mine. Will you join us?\"\n  \n \n  Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer before him.\nHe had one more question.\n  \n \n  \"Will it really work? Can it actually tell you how to motivate the\nstubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this Earth?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon smiled. \"You're here, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, his tense features relaxing.\n  \n \n  \"Enroll me as a member,\" he said.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n"

Would I start out this very morning and take the risk,\nthe terrible risk?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n  \n \n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n  \n \n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n  \n \n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n  \n \n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n  \n \n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n  \n \n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n  \n \n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n  \n \n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n  \n \n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n  \n \n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n  \n \n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n  \n \n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n  \n \n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n  \n \n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n  \n \n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n  \n \n  \"So far.

They had names:\nPietro, Marlene, Helene.\n  \n \n  Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to\nhim all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could\nalso talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense.\nConsistently, they made sense.\n  \n \n  The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green\nvalleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing\ntheir branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there\nwere pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them\nthat were alive and intelligent and soft and warm and wonderful to know.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   ... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting,\nshadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the\ndelirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love\u2014and all our\nown!\u2014than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known....\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the\ndreams.\n  \n \n  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would\nlook out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing\nbut seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.\n  \n \n  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again.\nThe dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"\n  \n \n  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he\ncouldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would\ndie. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into\nhimself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one\ncompensation\u2014he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them\nwho had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way\nacross the Cosmos.\n  \n \n  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him\nmuch more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He\ncould switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure\nto be five hundred thousand feet! It\n   \n   is\n   \n  impossible. We keep climbing\nand now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is\ngoing up and up\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the\nmatter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps\nlaughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it.\nWomen don't have real guts.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled\nsoftly at the door.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember\nhow you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I\nnever thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't\nmatter....\"\n  \n \n  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper.\n\"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and\nhysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish\nI were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that?\nI really love you, after all. After all....\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest\nmountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and\nwarm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What\nare you doing\u2014reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was\nthat, Bruce\u2014that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last\nnight before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n"

Quite ordinary faces. None of them\npaid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats,\njiggling with the motion of the bus.\n  \n \n  The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the\nsports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A\nbusinessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family.\n  \n \n  Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a\npackage on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white angora sweater.\nGazing absently ahead of her.\n  \n \n  A high school boy in jeans and black jacket.\n  \n \n  A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with\npackages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness.\n  \n \n  Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to\ntheir families. To dinner.\n  \n \n  Going home\u2014with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask\nof an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their\ntown, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in\nhis cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked.\nThey had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof.\n  \n \n  Maybe there were others.\n  \n \n  Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a\nmistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had\npassed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down.\nApparently their power-zone was limited.\n  \n \n  A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his\nchain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache.\nWell-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small\nhands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly\naway.\n  \n \n  Loyce tensed. One of\n   \n   them\n   \n  ? Or\u2014another they had missed?\n  \n \n  The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever.\nShrewd. A man too shrewd for them\u2014or one of the things itself, an alien\ninsect from beyond.\n  \n \n  The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into\nthe box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce.\n  \n \n  The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second\nsomething passed between them.\n  \n \n  A look rich with meaning.\n  \n \n  Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step\ndown into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber\ndoor swung open.\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. \"What the hell\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A\nresidential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him,\nthe bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet.\nThey were coming after him.\n  \n \n  Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against\nthe curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness.\nDesperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid\ndown again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off.\n  \n \n  Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in\nthe gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed\nbefore him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book.\n  \n \n  Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The\nman screamed and tried to roll away. \"\n   \n   Stop!\n   \n  For God's sake listen\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and\ndissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others\nwere there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk,\nup a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were\nbending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed\nman who had come after him.\n  \n \n  Had he made a mistake?\n  \n \n  But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out\u2014away from\nthem. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between\ntheir world and his.\n  \n"

        "  Raiders of the Second Moon\n  \n \n  By GENE ELLERMAN\n  \n \n  A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world\u2014to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason.

He stared after the other man\nwonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks,\nshaking his head and muttering.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now\u2014\n  \n \n  And now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\n  \n \n  \"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\n  \n \n  What happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\n  \n \n  The misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's\u2014and across both their\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\n  \n \n  In the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\none of the women bleated fearfully.\n  \n \n  Then Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\nin the illumined\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  , how near to swift death that moment of\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\nlightning speed.\n  \n<doc-sep>Gregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly\nthrough the labyrinthine corridors that were the entrails of the\nspace yacht\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  . He paused once to peer through a\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  set into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his\ngaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming\nsplotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading\ntheir ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's\ntiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet\nthat the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of\nspace-atmospherics through which the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  was now being twisted,\ntopsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal.\n  \n \n  He moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation\nrotunda which was the dining dome of the ship.\n  \n \n  His footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As\nhe hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass\nmirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they\nwere as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly.\n  \n \n  J. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand\nor more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation,\ndominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little\nNapoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and\nelaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the\nnearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid.\n  \n \n  On Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a\nmud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because\nof her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with\nsuppressed humor at\u2014guessed Greg\u2014the amusing foibles and frailties of\nthose about her.\n  \n \n  She gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and\nshapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics,\npausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a\nwatery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet\npoodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\"\n  \n \n  On J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused\nGregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as\nhe glimpsed her reflected vision\u2014all gold and crimson and cream\u2014in\nthe glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her\nloveliness.\n  \n \n  But\u2014Greg shook his head\u2014but she was not for him. She was already\npledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned\nto murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and\ndisliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich\nbrownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes.\n  \n \n  The sound of his own name startled Greg.\n  \n \n  \"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where\nin blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone\nin general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\n  \n \n  \"It's the very\n   \n   best\n   \n  Martian honey,\" said his wife.\n  \n \n  \"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\n  \n \n  \"It's still bitter,\" said J. Foster petulantly.\n  \n \n  His sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\"\n  \n \n  \"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice\nagain. \"\n   \n   Malcolm!\n   \n  Where\n   \n   are\n   \n  you?\"\n  \n \n  \"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded\npolitely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss\nAndrews ... Mr. Breadon....\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\nanyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio\nturret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\"\n  \n \n  Malcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words\nregistered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that?\nDon't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly.\n  \n \n  \"No trans\u2014nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million\ncredits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment\nthroughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right\nup there and\u2014\"\n  \n"

He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\n  \n \n  He saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things\u2014\n  \n \n  He nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\ndisaster.\n  \n \n  \"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\ndismay.\n  \n \n  \"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no\u2014\" He stopped\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey\u2014this place is\n   \n   dangerous\n   \n  ! There are\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Ralph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\n  \n \n  And J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\nman. We want action!\"\n  \n \n  Sparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Hannigan groaned and followed him.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Breadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\ncruiser.\"\n  \n \n  Hannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I said.\"\n  \n \n  \"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\n  \n \n  Breadon flushed darkly.\n  \n \n  \"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\nyou are a radio operator?\"\n  \n \n  \"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\n\"Put a million credits into the\n   \n   Carefree\n   \n  . Best equipment throughout.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\nboth right. I\n   \n   am\n   \n  a radio operator, and there\n   \n   was\n   \n  a radio. But we\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\nmaster switch\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\ndon't bounce so good.\"\n  \n \n  Greg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\nknow till I get going on it.\"\n  \n \n  Breadon frowned.\n  \n \n  \"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\n  \n \n  Breadon glared at him wrathfully.\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\nsee that!\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol?\n   \n   SOS.\nStranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan,\nmaybe.\n   \n  They'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our\nknees.\"\n  \n \n  Breadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I\u2014I don't\nknow. We have a compass\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He\nhad been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the\nskiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his\nright forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He\nsaid, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search\nin half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\"\n  \n \n  Maud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first\ntime in her life.\n  \n \n  \"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\"\n  \n"

This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ...

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Again they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\n  \n \n  The pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\n  \n \n  The President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n  \n \n  \"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  heroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\n  \n \n  He paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Proceed.\"\n  \n \n  Michael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\n  \n \n  The President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n  \n \n  \"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n  \n \n  \"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\n   \n   born\n   \n  and haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\n  \n \n  The President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\n  \n \n  Now they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\n  \n \n  Michael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n  \n \n  \"Stop!\" he said quietly.\n  \n \n  They halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n  \n \n  \"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  The faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n  \n \n  \"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n  \n \n  \"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\n  \n \n  The President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\n  \n \n  Michael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\n  \n \n  The half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\n   \n   Let\n   \n  them be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\n  \n \n  There was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\n  \n \n  Haltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\n   \n   will\n   \n  die. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n  \n \n  \"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n  \n \n  \"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n  \n \n  \"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now.

        "When he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\n  \n \n  The gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\n  \n \n  The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\n  \n \n  It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n  \n \n  \"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\n  \n \n  He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n  \n \n  \"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\n  \n \n  A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\n  \n \n  I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\n  \n \n  And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\n  \n \n  He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\n  \n \n \n   The clock was warm.\n   \n \n \n  He felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\n  \n \n  He touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\n  \n \n  Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\n  \n \n  He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\n  \n<doc-sep>  Wanderers of the Wolf Moon\n  \n \n  By NELSON S.

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n  \n"

Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes.

He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n  \n<doc-sep>The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do\nbut stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing\nwall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until\nthere was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights\nand the snow.\n  \n \n  By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to\ntry to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still\ndidn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window\nthrough the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which\nwere beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still\ndrunk\u2014maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan\nheld no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind\nof guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be\nwaiting....\n  \n \n  A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the\nshack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like\nto know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but\nhe said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at\nthe same time, because now they were coming to him.\n  \n \n  He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it\nwas bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they\nwouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their\nship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put\na call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only\nanswer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and\nhe wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you\ncould not blame him.\n  \n \n  Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man\u2014who turned out to\nbe Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically\ncleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.\n  \n \n  \"Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might\nget the rest of the folks out on that.\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shrugged. \"Don't count on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"But they have a contract!\"\n  \n \n  The soldier grinned.\n  \n \n  The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:\n\"Who cut that wire, Cap?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>She was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without\nstopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is\nimpossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken\noff a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently\nneeded elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years\npass before he learns it's never coming.\n  \n \n  \"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't\nvanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend\non ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time,\ncredit established, lost identification replaced\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any\ntrouble.\"\n  \n \n  She seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was\nmore congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited\nnumber of ships and using statistical probability as a guide\u2014why, no\nman would arrive at his predetermined destination.\n  \n \n  But that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare\ngalactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a\ngiant room. Or could you?\n  \n \n  For the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship,\nwas the comparison too apt? It might be.\n  \n \n  \"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to\nbe settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused.\n\"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third\nring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They\ndon't encourage immigration.\"\n  \n \n  In effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a\npassenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of\nhaving a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when\nhis money was gone.\n  \n \n  Cassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring.\n  \n \n  \"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't,\" he promised grimly.\n  \n"

According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n  \n<doc-sep>Hesitantly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a\npoint\u2014but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat.\nBlote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. \"Kindly direct\nme, Dan,\" Blote demanded. \"Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know the town very well,\" Dan said, \"but Maple's over that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky.\nFaint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan\nlooked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.\n  \n \n  \"Over there,\" he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped\nsmoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.\n  \n \n  \"Better let me take over now,\" Dan suggested. \"I want to be sure to\nget us to the right place.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well, Dan.\"\n  \n \n  Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly\nseen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage\ngrew even fainter. \"Best we remain unnoticed,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying\nlandmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely\nvisible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers\nalong both sides of the passage at once.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines\nemploy a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where\nthey do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered\nleft, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous\nfigures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed\nwrong\u2014\n  \n \n  The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus.\nBlote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete\nwalls, the barred door and\u2014\n  \n \n  \"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed.\n  \n \n  \"Grab him!\" someone yelled.\n  \n \n  Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt\nto regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a\nlever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures\nas the carrier shot away through the cell wall.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the\nclear, he would have to decide on his next move\u2014fast. There was no\ntelling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide\nthe carrier, then\u2014\n  \n \n  A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume.\nDan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.\n  \n \n  The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of\nmechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous\nlandscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the\ndeafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once.\nIf the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked\nthe controls, dropping toward the distant earth.\n  \n \n  The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought\nthe carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few\ninches and cut the switch.\n  \n \n  As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.\n  \n \n  Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise\nwas, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians\nin the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why\nhadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no\nsound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a\nsecluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in,\nreached for the controls\u2014\n  \n \n  There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials\nbefore him frosted over. There was a loud\n   \n   pop!\n   \n  like a flashbulb\nexploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle\nwhich hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded\nto blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a\ntight-fitting white uniform stepped through.\n  \n \n  Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face,\nthe long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly\nred-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat\npillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set\nyellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in\na smile which showed square yellowish teeth.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Alors, monsieur\n   \n  ,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in\na quick bow. \"\n   \n   Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\"\n  \n \n  \"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me.\nPermit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Class\nfive, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"That siren,\" Dan said. \"Was that you?\"\n  \n \n  Dzhackoon nodded. \"For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined to\nstop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  \"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked.\n  \n \n  \"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our\nlanguage coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you want with me?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself.\nHe was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched\nto his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had.

Within the next five years\u2014maybe.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>She glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth.\nDestination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales\nengineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.\n  \n \n  \"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of\ncustomer relations.\"\n  \n \n  \"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows\narched.\n  \n \n  \"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"\n  \n \n  He could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.\n  \n \n  \"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can\nguess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study\nunder them.\"\n  \n \n  Close\u2014but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not\nnecessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could\nbuild Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even\nless likely.\n  \n \n  There was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21\nthat Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies\nthat had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he\ncould help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that\ncould build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag\ncould set its own price, which could be control of all communications,\ntransport, trade\u2014a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of\nall that.\n  \n \n  His part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher\nto come to Earth,\n   \n   if he could\n   \n  . Literally, he had to guess the\nTunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew it. In addition,\nthe reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their\narrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working\nfor ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as\nDimanche was a key factor.\n  \n \n  Her voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"\n  \n \n  \"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've\nbeen here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney\n21.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the\nscreen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"\n   \n   Rickrock C\n   \n  arrived\nyesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will\nthe next ship arrive?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  He didn't answer.\n  \n"

        "\"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the\nfirst counselor had named.\n  \n \n  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle,\nattached his name, and dropped it into the chute.\n  \n \n  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a Huntner?\"\n  \n \n  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing\nabout her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other information?\"\n  \n \n  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached\nher. I got out as fast as I could.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless,\nit sounded depressing.\n  \n \n  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as\nelectronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"\n  \n \n  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly\ninquisitive at times.\n  \n \n  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on\nthe other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man\nwas staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed\nevery sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was\nremoving the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him.\nHe turned and peered.\n  \n \n  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.\n  \n \n  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting\nfor my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions.\n\"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency.\nWhy did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency\nwere new.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor\nresigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one\ndidn't like the name of the agency, so she ordered it changed.\"\n  \n \n  She would do just that, thought Cassal. \"What about this Murra Foray?\"\n  \n \n  The old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and then seemed\novercome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled away.\n  \n \n  Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for his job,\nafraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal didn't know. He\nshrugged and went on. The agency was now in motion in his behalf, but\nhe didn't intend to depend on that alone.\n  \n<doc-sep>The woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his\nestimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he.\nNothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that\nhe was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first\ncounselor.\n  \n \n  \"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is\nspecial, though\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"\n  \n \n  She nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that\nyou'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum\nthat would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any\nappreciable time.\n  \n \n  He stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always\nwork, if I have to.\"\n  \n \n  \"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do\nbusiness with Godolphians.\"\n  \n \n  Irony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.\n  \n \n  \"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special\nknowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The\ninstrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large.\nFrom the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that\ninformation at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he\ncould get. Dimanche was his special advantage.\n  \n \n  \"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can\nalways find something in that line.\"\n  \n \n  \"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the\nMilky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't\nyet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better\nas a salesman.\"\n  \n \n  He got up, glowering. \"If that's all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot\nprovided for that purpose as you leave.\"\n  \n \n  A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle,\nswung open. The agency was efficient.\n  \n \n  \"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is\nhard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was\nalso eminently practical.\n  \n \n  The exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable\ncontribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the\nbureau.\n  \n<doc-sep>All at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots\u2014cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm\u2014that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  \u2014but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\n  \n"

But the horror\n    \n   is the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n   \n \n \n \n  \"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n  \n \n  \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\n  \n \n  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\n  \n \n  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\n   \n   could\n   \n  walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\n  \n \n  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n  \n \n  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n  \n \n  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted\u2014for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n  \n \n  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n  \n \n  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\n  \n \n  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n  \n<doc-sep>The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the\nantiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to\nthe manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly\ndisorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high\noverhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance\nof their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool\nof illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they\nreached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck\nloading door he had seen from outside.\n  \n \n  Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving\nwith raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set\nof automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door\nexactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these\nmaterials handling machines.\"\n  \n \n  Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening\nmachines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in\nformation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n  \n \n  They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with\ntwo arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms,\nfashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a\nrelaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n  \n \n  Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really,\nthese machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole\nplant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really\na single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about\nthe toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously\nuseful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n  \n \n  Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one\nof the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily\ntugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second,\nand before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away\nto attend to mysterious duties of their own.\n  \n \n \n \n  Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of\nfrustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be\nreplaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to\na large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and\nother materials were stored.\n  \n \n  \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any\nshortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the\ntrace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received,\nit's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the\nplant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary\nmaterials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and\npackage the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is\nsent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is\nsent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if\nthe withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the\npurchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take\nyou through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but\nthey're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Casper Craig was still dictating the gram:\n  \n \n  \"Amazing quality of longevity seemingly inherent in the locale. Climate\nideal. Daylight or half-light. All twenty-one hours from Planet\nDelphina and from Sol. Pure water for all industrial purposes. Scenic\nand storied. Zoning and pre-settlement restrictions to insure congenial\nneighbors. A completely planned globular settlement in a near arm of\nour own galaxy. Low taxes and liberal credit. Financing our specialty\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And you had better have an armed escort when you return,\" said Father\nBriton.\n  \n \n  \"Why in cosmos would we want an armed escort?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's as phony as a seven-credit note!\"\n  \n \n  \"You, a man of the cloth doubt it?

Without comment, they pointed a cosmic finger at\nthe tarnished brass plaque commemorating the martyrdom of the Three\nPhysicists after the dropping of the Hell Bomb.

BADE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by L. WOROMAY\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  To the men of the future, the scientific\n   \n  goals of today were as incomprehensible\n   \n  as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!\n  \n \n \n  There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?\n  \n"

        "The President's Secretary, a paunchy veteran of party caucuses, was\nalso glad that it was the Thinkers who had created the machine, though\nhe trembled at the power that it gave them over the Administration.\nStill, you could do business with the Thinkers. And nobody (not even\nthe Thinkers) could do business (that sort of business) with Maizie!\n  \n \n  Before that great square face with its thousands of tiny metal\nfeatures, only Jorj Helmuth seemed at ease, busily entering on the\ntape the complex Questions of the Day that the high officials had\nhanded him: logistics for the Endless War in Pakistan, optimum size for\nnext year's sugar-corn crop, current thought trends in average Soviet\nminds\u2014profound questions, yet many of them phrased with surprising\nsimplicity. For figures, technical jargon, and layman's language were\nalike to Maizie; there was no need to translate into mathematical\nshorthand, as with the lesser brain-machines.\n  \n \n  The click of the taper went on until the Secretary of State had twice\nnervously fired a cigaret with his ultrasonic lighter and twice quickly\nput it away. No one spoke.\n  \n \n  Jorj looked up at the Secretary of Space. \"Section Five, Question\nFour\u2014whom would that come from?\"\n  \n \n  The burly man frowned. \"That would be the physics boys, Opperly's\ngroup. Is anything wrong?\"\n  \n \n  Jorj did not answer. A bit later he quit taping and began to adjust\ncontrols, going up on the boom-chair to reach some of them. Eventually\nhe came down and touched a few more, then stood waiting.\n  \n \n  From the great cube came a profound, steady purring. Involuntarily the\nsix officials backed off a bit. Somehow it was impossible for a man to\nget used to the sound of Maizie starting to think.\n  \n<doc-sep>The grizzled general\u2014there was also one who was gray\u2014was thinking\nthat this was a very odd link in the chain of command. Some shadowy and\nusually well-controlled memories from World War II faintly stirred his\nire. Here he was giving orders to a being immeasurably more intelligent\nthan himself. And always orders of the \"Tell me how to kill that man\"\nrather than the \"Kill that man\" sort. The distinction bothered him\nobscurely. It relieved him to know that Maizie had built-in controls\nwhich made her always the servant of humanity, or of humanity's\nright-minded leaders\u2014even the Thinkers weren't certain which.\n  \n \n  The gray general was thinking uneasily, and, like the President, at a\nmore turbid level, of the resemblance between Papal infallibility and\nthe dictates of the machine. Suddenly his bony wrists began to tremble.\nHe asked himself: Was this the Second Coming? Mightn't an incarnation\nbe in metal rather than flesh?\n  \n \n  The austere Secretary of State was remembering what he'd taken such\npains to make everyone forget: his youthful flirtation at Lake Success\nwith Buddhism. Sitting before his\n   \n   guru\n   \n  , his teacher, feeling the\nOccidental's awe at the wisdom of the East, or its pretense, he had\nfelt a little like this.\n  \n \n  The burly Secretary of Space, who had come up through United Rockets,\nwas thanking his stars that at any rate the professional scientists\nweren't responsible for this job. Like the grizzled general, he'd\nalways felt suspicious of men who kept telling you how to do things,\nrather than doing them themselves. In World War III he'd had his fill\nof the professional physicists, with their eternal taint of a misty\nsort of radicalism and free-thinking. The Thinkers were better\u2014more\ndisciplined, more human. They'd called their brain-machine Maizie,\nwhich helped take the curse off her. Somewhat.\n  \n<doc-sep>Meanwhile the question tape, like a New Year's streamer tossed out\na high window into the night, sped on its dark way along spinning\nrollers. Curling with an intricate aimlessness curiously like that\nof such a streamer, it tantalized the silvery fingers of a thousand\nrelays, saucily evaded the glances of ten thousand electric eyes,\nimpishly darted down a narrow black alleyway of memory banks, and,\nreaching the center of the cube, suddenly emerged into a small room\nwhere a suave fat man in shorts sat drinking beer.\n  \n \n  He flipped the tape over to him with practiced finger, eyeing it as\na stockbroker might have studied a ticker tape. He read the first\nquestion, closed his eyes and frowned for five seconds. Then with the\nstaccato self-confidence of a hack writer, he began to tape out the\nanswer.\n  \n \n  For many minutes the only sounds were the rustle of the paper ribbon\nand the click of the taper, except for the seconds the fat man took to\nclose his eyes, or to drink or pour beer. Once, too, he lifted a phone,\nasked a concise question, waited half a minute, listened to an answer,\nthen went back to the grind.\n  \n \n  Until he came to Section Five, Question Four. That time he did his\nthinking with his eyes open.\n  \n \n  The question was: \"Does Maizie stand for Maelzel?\"\n  \n \n  He sat for a while slowly scratching his thigh. His loose, persuasive\nlips tightened, without closing, into the shape of a snarl.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he began to tape again.\n  \n \n  \"Maizie does not stand for Maelzel. Maizie stands for amazing,\nhumorously given the form of a girl's name. Section Six, Answer One:\nThe mid-term election viewcasts should be spaced as follows....\"\n  \n \n  But his lips didn't lose the shape of a snarl.\n  \n"

Still, he grumbled silently, Caddy might have\nhad enough consideration to clear out before he awoke. He wondered\nif he shouldn't have used his hypnotic control of the girl to smooth\ntheir relationship last night, and for a moment the word that would\nsend her into deep trance trembled on the tip of his tongue. But no,\nthat special power of his over her was reserved for far more important\npurposes.\n  \n \n  Pumping dynamic tension into his 20-year-old muscles and confidence\ninto his 60-year-old mind, the 40-year-old Thinker rose from bed.\nNo covers had to be thrown off; the nuclear heating unit made them\nunnecessary. He stepped into his clothing\u2014the severe tunic, tights and\nsockassins of the modern business man. Next he glanced at the message\ntape beside his phone, washed down with ginger ale a vita-amino-enzyme\ntablet, and walked to the window. There, gazing along the rows of newly\nplanted mutant oaks lining Decontamination Avenue, his smooth face\nbroke into a smile.\n  \n \n  It had come to him, the next big move in the intricate game making\nup his life\u2014and mankind's. Come to him during sleep, as so many of\nhis best decisions did, because he regularly employed the time-saving\ntechnique of somno-thought, which could function at the same time as\nsomno-learning.\n  \n \n  He set his who?-where? robot for \"Rocket Physicist\" and \"Genius Class.\"\nWhile it worked, he dictated to his steno-robot the following brief\nmessage:\n  \n \n  Dear Fellow Scientist:\n  \n \n  A project is contemplated that will have a crucial bearing on man's\nfuture in deep space.

Few remember that\nhe spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the\nphilosopher's stone. Which Newton did the world need then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you are justifying the Thinkers!\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I leave that to history.\"\n  \n \n  \"And history consists of the actions of men,\" Farquar concluded. \"I\nintend to act. The Thinkers are vulnerable, their power fantastically\nprecarious. What's it based on? A few lucky guesses. Faith-healing.\nSome science hocus-pocus, on the level of those juke-box burlesque acts\nbetween the strips. Dubious mental comfort given to a few nerve-torn\nneurotics in the Inner Cabinet\u2014and their wives. The fact that the\nThinkers' clever stage-managing won the President a doubtful election.\nThe erroneous belief that the Soviets pulled out of Iraq and Iran\nbecause of the Thinkers' Mind Bomb threat. A brain-machine that's just\na cover for Jan Tregarron's guesswork. Oh, yes, and that hogwash of\n'Martian wisdom.' All of it mere bluff! A few pushes at the right times\nand points are all that are needed\u2014and the Thinkers know it! I'll bet\nthey're terrified already, and will be more so when they find that\nwe're gunning for them. Eventually they'll be making overtures to us,\nturning to us for help. You wait and see.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am thinking again of Hitler,\" Opperly interposed quietly. \"On his\nfirst half dozen big steps, he had nothing but bluff. His generals\nwere against him. They knew they were in a cardboard fort. Yet he won\nevery battle, until the last. Moreover,\" he pressed on, cutting Farquar\nshort, \"the power of the Thinkers isn't based on what they've got, but\non what the world hasn't got\u2014peace, honor, a good conscience....\"\n  \n \n  The front-door knocker clanked. Farquar answered it. A skinny old man\nwith a radiation scar twisting across his temple handed him a tiny\ncylinder. \"Radiogram for you, Willard.\" He grinned across the hall at\nOpperly. \"When are you going to get a phone put in, Mr. Opperly?\"\n  \n \n  The physicist waved to him. \"Next year, perhaps, Mr. Berry.\"\n  \n \n  The old man snorted with good-humored incredulity and trudged off.\n  \n \n  \"What did I tell you about the Thinkers making overtures?\" Farquar\nchortled suddenly. \"It's come sooner than I expected. Look at this.\"\n  \n \n  He held out the radiogram, but the older man didn't take it. Instead he\nasked, \"Who's it from? Tregarron?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, from Helmuth. There's a lot of sugar corn about man's future in\ndeep space, but the real reason is clear. They know that they're going\nto have to produce an actual nuclear rocket pretty soon, and for that\nthey'll need our help.\"\n  \n \n  \"An invitation?\"\n  \n \n  Farquar nodded. \"For this afternoon.\" He noticed Opperly's anxious\nthough distant frown. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. \"Are you bothered\nabout my going? Are you thinking it might be a trap\u2014that after the\nMaelzel question they may figure I'm better rubbed out?\"\n  \n \n  The older man shook his head. \"I'm not afraid for your life, Willard.\nThat's yours to risk as you choose. No, I'm worried about other things\nthey might do to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Farquar asked.\n  \n<doc-sep>Sunlight striking through French windows spotlighted a ballet of dust\nmotes untroubled by air-conditioning. Morton Opperly's living room was\nwell-kept but worn and quite behind the times. Instead of reading tapes\nthere were books; instead of steno-robots, pen and ink; while in place\nof a four by six TV screen, a Picasso hung on the wall. Only Opperly\nknew that the painting was still faintly radioactive, that it had been\nriskily so when he'd smuggled it out of his bomb-singed apartment in\nNew York City.\n  \n \n  The two physicists fronted each other across a coffee table. The face\nof the elder was cadaverous, large-eyed, and tender\u2014fined down by\na long life of abstract thought. That of the younger was forceful,\nsensuous, bulky as his body, and exceptionally ugly. He looked rather\nlike a bear.\n  \n \n  Opperly was saying, \"So when he asked who was responsible for the\nMaelzel question, I said I didn't remember.\" He smiled. \"They still\nallow me my absent-mindedness, since it nourishes their contempt.\nAlmost my sole remaining privilege.\" The smile faded. \"Why do you keep\non teasing the zoo animals, Willard?\" he asked without rancor. \"I've\nmaintained many times that we shouldn't truckle to them by yielding\nto their demand that we ask Maizie questions. You and the rest have\noverruled me. But then to use those questions to convey veiled insults\nisn't reasonable. Apparently the Secretary of Space was bothered enough\nabout this last one to pay me a 'copter call within twenty minutes of\nthis morning's meeting at the Foundation. Why do you do it, Willard?\"\n  \n \n  The features of the other convulsed unpleasantly. \"Because the\nThinkers are charlatans who must be exposed,\" he rapped out. \"We know\ntheir Maizie is no more than a tealeaf-reading fake. We've traced their\nMars rockets and found they go nowhere. We know their Martian mental\nscience is bunk.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we've already exposed the Thinkers very thoroughly,\" Opperly\ninterposed quietly. \"You know the good it did.\"\n  \n \n  Farquar hunched his Japanese-wrestler shoulders. \"Then it's got to be\ndone until it takes.\"\n  \n \n  Opperly studied the bowl of mutated flowers by the coffee pot. \"I think\nyou just want to tease the animals, for some personal reason of which\nyou probably aren't aware.\"\n  \n \n  Farquar scowled. \"We're the ones in the cages.\"\n  \n"

WOROMAY\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  To the men of the future, the scientific\n   \n  goals of today were as incomprehensible\n   \n  as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!\n  \n \n \n  There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?\n  \n<doc-sep>  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n This etext was produced from Analog March 1962. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\n  \n  ILLUSTRATED\n   \n  BY\n   \n  KRENKEL\n   \n \n \n \n  HIS MASTER'S VOICE\n   \n  ANALOG SCIENCE FACT \u00b7 SCIENCE FICTION\n   \n \n \n  Spaceship McGuire had lots of knowledge\u2014but no wisdom. He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  The Winning of the Moon\n  \n \n  BY KRIS NEVILLE\n  \n \n  The enemy was friendly enough.\n   \n  Trouble was\u2014their friendship\n   \n  was as dangerous as their hate!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  General Finogenov notified Major Winship that the underground blast was\nscheduled for the following morning.\n  \n \n  Major Winship, after receiving the message, discussed precautions with\nthe three other Americans.\n  \n \n  Next morning, before the sunlight exploded, the four of them donned\ntheir space suits and went and sat outside the dome, waiting. The sun\nrose with its bright, silent clap of radiance. Black pools of shadows\nlay in harsh contrast, their edges drawn with geometric precision.\n  \n \n  Major Winship attempted unsuccessfully to communicate with Base\nGagarin. \"Will you please request the general to keep us informed on\nthe progress of the countdown?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply. \"Help?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Nyet\n   \n  ,\" said Major Winship, exhausting his Russian. \"Count down.\nProgress. When\u2014boom?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is Pinov,\" came the reply.\n  \n \n  \"Boom! Boom!\" said Major Winship in exasperation.\n  \n \n  \"Boom!\" said Pinov happily.\n  \n \n  \"When?\"\n  \n \n  \"Boom\u2014boom!\" said Pinov.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, nuts.\" Major Winship cut out the circuit. \"They've got Pinov on\nemergency watch this morning,\" he explained to the other Americans.\n\"The one that doesn't speak English.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's done it deliberately,\" said Capt. Wilkins, the eldest of the four\nAmericans. \"How are we going to know when it's over?\"\n  \n \n  No one bothered to respond. They sat for a while in silence while the\nshadows evaporated. One by one they clicked on their cooling systems.\n  \n \n  Ultimately, Lt. Chandler said, \"This is a little ridiculous. I'm going\nto switch over to their channel. Rap if you want me.\" He sat transfixed\nfor several minutes. \"Ah, it's all Russian. Jabbering away. I can't\ntell a thing that's going on.\"\n  \n \n  In the airless void of the moon, the blast itself would be silent. A\nmoth's wing of dust would, perhaps, rise and settle beyond the horizon:\nno more.\n  \n \n  \"Static?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll get static on these things.\"\n  \n \n  A small infinity seemed to pass very slowly.\n  \n \n  Major Winship shifted restlessly. \"My reefer's gone on the fritz.\"\nPerspiration was trickling down his face.\n  \n \n  \"Let's all go in,\" said the fourth American, Capt. Lawler. \"It's\nprobably over by now.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try again,\" Major Winship said and switched to the emergency\nchannel. \"Base Gagarin? Base Gagarin?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is Pinov. Help?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Nyet.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Pinov's still there,\" Major Winship said.\n  \n \n  \"Tell him, 'Help',\" said Capt. Wilkins, \"so he'll get somebody we can\ntalk to.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see them all in hell, first,\" Major Winship said.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later, the perspiration was rivers across his face. \"This\nis it,\" he said. \"I'm going in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I've got to cool off.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hell, Charlie, I feel stupid sitting out here,\" Capt. Lawler said.\n\"The shot probably went off an hour ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"The static level hasn't gone up much, if at all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" Lt. Chandler said, \"it's buried too deep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe so,\" Major Winship said. \"But we can't have the dome fall down\naround all our ears.\" He stood. \"Whew! You guys stay put.\"\n  \n"

        "Ten minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\n  \n \n  For obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\n  \n \n  They can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\n   \n   average\n   \n  velocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\n  \n \n  I got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\n  \n \n  Testing spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\n   \n   DANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n   \n  ; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n  \n \n  Every schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\n  \n \n  And every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\n  \n \n  The Political Survey Division\n   \n   does\n   \n  evaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\n  \n \n  The PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\n  \n \n  McGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\n   \n   was\n   \n  the spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\n  \n \n  Unforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\n  \n \n  But with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\n   \n   fast\n   \n  ! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\n  \n \n  That meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\n  \n \n  And that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\n  \n<doc-sep>Hesitantly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a\npoint\u2014but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat.\nBlote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. \"Kindly direct\nme, Dan,\" Blote demanded. \"Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know the town very well,\" Dan said, \"but Maple's over that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky.\nFaint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan\nlooked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.\n  \n \n  \"Over there,\" he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped\nsmoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.\n  \n \n  \"Better let me take over now,\" Dan suggested. \"I want to be sure to\nget us to the right place.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well, Dan.\"\n  \n \n  Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly\nseen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage\ngrew even fainter. \"Best we remain unnoticed,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying\nlandmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely\nvisible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers\nalong both sides of the passage at once.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines\nemploy a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where\nthey do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered\nleft, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous\nfigures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed\nwrong\u2014\n  \n \n  The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus.\nBlote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete\nwalls, the barred door and\u2014\n  \n \n  \"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed.\n  \n \n  \"Grab him!\" someone yelled.\n  \n \n  Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt\nto regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a\nlever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures\nas the carrier shot away through the cell wall.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the\nclear, he would have to decide on his next move\u2014fast. There was no\ntelling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide\nthe carrier, then\u2014\n  \n \n  A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume.\nDan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.\n  \n \n  The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of\nmechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous\nlandscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the\ndeafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once.\nIf the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked\nthe controls, dropping toward the distant earth.\n  \n \n  The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought\nthe carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few\ninches and cut the switch.\n  \n \n  As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.\n  \n \n  Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise\nwas, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians\nin the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why\nhadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no\nsound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a\nsecluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in,\nreached for the controls\u2014\n  \n \n  There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials\nbefore him frosted over. There was a loud\n   \n   pop!\n   \n  like a flashbulb\nexploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle\nwhich hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded\nto blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a\ntight-fitting white uniform stepped through.\n  \n \n  Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face,\nthe long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly\nred-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat\npillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set\nyellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in\na smile which showed square yellowish teeth.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Alors, monsieur\n   \n  ,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in\na quick bow. \"\n   \n   Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\"\n  \n \n  \"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me.\nPermit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Class\nfive, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"That siren,\" Dan said. \"Was that you?\"\n  \n \n  Dzhackoon nodded. \"For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined to\nstop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  \"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked.\n  \n \n  \"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our\nlanguage coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you want with me?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had\nfinished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet.\nHe stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his\ncigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.\n  \n \n  \"You don't believe me,\" Loyce said.\n  \n \n  The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently\naway. \"Suit yourself.\" The Commissioner moved over to the window and\nstood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. \"I believe you,\"\nhe said abruptly.\n  \n \n  Loyce sagged. \"Thank God.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you got away.\" The Commissioner shook his head. \"You were down in\nyour cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. \"I have a\ntheory,\" he murmured.\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting\nat the top\u2014the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a\nwidening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next\ntown. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on\nfor a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"A long time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Thousands of years. I don't think it's new.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why do you say that?\"\n  \n \n  \"When I was a kid.... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A\nreligious picture\u2014an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah.\nMoloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were all represented by figures.\" Loyce looked up at the\nCommissioner. \"Beelzebub was represented as\u2014a giant fly.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner grunted. \"An old struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They\nmake gains\u2014but finally they're defeated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why defeated?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the\nHebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The\nrealization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they\nunderstood. Had escaped, like I did.\" He clenched his fists. \"I killed\none of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n  \n \n  The Commissioner nodded. \"Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did.\nFreak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.\" He\nturned from the window. \"Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured\neverything out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the\nlamppost. I don't understand that.\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  Why did they deliberately hang\nhim there?\"\n  \n \n  \"That would seem simple.\" The Commissioner smiled faintly. \"\n   \n   Bait.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. \"Bait? What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was\nunder control\u2014and who had escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce recoiled with horror. \"Then they\n   \n   expected\n   \n  failures! They\nanticipated\u2014\" He broke off. \"They were ready with a trap.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.\" The\nCommissioner abruptly moved toward the door. \"Come along, Loyce. There's\na lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. \"And the man.\n   \n   Who was the\nman?\n   \n  I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger.\nAll muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.\n\"Maybe,\" he said softly, \"you'll understand that, too. Come along with\nme, Mr. Loyce.\" He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a\nglimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a\nplatform of some sort. A telephone pole\u2014and a rope! \"Right this way,\"\nthe Commissioner said, smiling coldly.\n  \n"

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n  \n<doc-sep>My sarcasm didn't faze him in the least. \"Rhetorical. It follows that\nyou are the only man whose orders McGuire will obey.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your robotocists can change that,\" I said. This time, I was giving him\nmy version of \"genuine\" innocence.\n  [7]\n  A man has to be a good actor to be\na competent double agent, and I didn't want Ravenhurst to know that I\nknew a great deal more about the problem than he did.\n  \n \n  He shook his head, making his jowls wobble. \"No, they cannot. They\nrealize now that there should be some way of making that change, but\nthey failed to see that it would be necessary. Only by completely\ndraining McGuire's memory banks and refilling them with new data can\nthis bias be eliminated.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then why don't they do that?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are two very good reasons,\" he said. And there was a shade of\nanger in his tone. \"In the first place, that sort of operation takes\ntime, and it costs money. If we do that, we might as well go ahead and\nmake the slight changes in structure necessary to incorporate some of\nthe improvements that the robotocists now feel are necessary. In other\nwords, they might as well go ahead and build the MGYR-8, which is\nprecisely the thing I hired you to prevent.\"\n  \n \n  \"It seems you have a point there, Mr. Ravenhurst.\" He'd hired me\nbecause things were shaky at Viking. If he lost too much more money on\nthe McGuire experiment, he stood a good chance of losing his position\nas manager. If that happened some of his other managerial contracts\nmight be canceled, too. Things like that can begin to snowball, and\nRavenhurst might find himself out of the managerial business entirely.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I went on, \"hasn't the additional wasted time already cost you\n  [8]\n  money?\"\n  \n \n  \"It has. I was reluctant to call you in again\u2014understandably enough, I\nthink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Perfectly. It's mutual.\"\n  \n \n  He ignored me. \"I even considered going through with the rebuilding\nwork, now that we have traced down the source of failure of the first\nsix models. Unfortunately, that isn't feasible, either.\" He scowled at\nme.\n  \n \n  \"It seems,\" he went on, \"that McGuire refuses to allow his brain to\nbe tampered with. The self-preservation 'instinct' has come to the\nfore. He has refused to let the technicians and robotocists enter his\nhull, and he has threatened to take off and leave Ceres if any further\nattempts are made to ... ah ... disrupt his thinking processes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't say that I blame him,\" I said. \"What do you want me to do? Go\nto Ceres and tell him to submit like a good boy?\"\n  \n \n  \"It is too late for that, Mr. Oak. Viking cannot stand any more of\nthat kind of drain on its financial resources. I have been banking on\nthe McGuire-type ships to put Viking Spacecraft ahead of every other\nspacecraft company in the System.\" He looked suddenly very grim and\nvery determined. \"Mr. Oak, I am\n   \n   certain\n   \n  that the robot ship is the\nanswer to the transportation problems in the Solar System. For the sake\nof every human being in the Solar System, we must get the bugs out of\nMcGuire!\"\n  \n \n \n   What's good for General Bull-moose is good for everybody\n   \n  , I quoted\nto myself. I'd have said it out loud,\n  [9]\n  but I was fairly certain that\nShalimar Ravenhurst was not a student of the classics.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, I would like you to go to Ceres and co-operate with the\nrobotocists at Viking. When the MGYR-8 is finally built, I want it to\nbe the prototype for a fast, safe, functional robot spaceship that can\nbe turned out commercially. You can be of great service, Mr. Oak.\"\n  \n \n  \"In other words, I've got you over a barrel.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't deny it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You know what my fees are, Mr. Ravenhurst. That's what you'll be\ncharged. I'll expect to be paid weekly; if Viking goes broke, I don't\nwant to lose more than a week's pay. On the other hand, if the MGYR-8\nis successful, I will expect a substantial bonus.\"\n  \n \n  \"How much?\"\n  \n \n  \"Exactly half of the cost of rebuilding. Half what it would take to\nbuild a Model 8 right now, and taking a chance on there being no bugs\nin it.\"\n  \n \n  He considered that, looking grimmer than ever. Then he said: \"I will\ndo it on the condition that the bonus be paid off in installments, one\neach six months for three years after the first successful commercial\nship is built by Viking.\"\n  \n \n  \"My lawyer will nail you down on that wording,\" I said, \"but it's a\ndeal. Is there anything else?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I think I'll leave for Ceres before you break a blood vessel.\"\n  \n \n  \"You continue to amaze me, Mr. Oak,\" he said. And the soft oiliness\n  [10]\n  of\nhis voice was the oil of vitriol. \"Your compassion for your fellowman\nis a facet of your personality that I had not seen before. I shall\nwelcome the opportunity to relax and allow my blood pressure to\nsubside.\"\n  \n \n  I could almost see Shalimar Ravenhurst suddenly exploding and adding\nhis own touch of color to the room.\n  \n \n  And, on that gladsome thought, I left. I let him have his small verbal\ntriumph; if he'd known that I'd have taken on the job for almost\nnothing, he'd really have blown up.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  AMBITION\n  \n \n  By WILLIAM L.

Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit. How?\n  \n"

        "Ten minutes later, I was in my vacuum suit, walking across the glaring,\nrough-polished rectangle of metal that was the landing field of\nRaven's Rest. The sun was near the zenith in the black, diamond-dusted\nsky, and the shadow of my flitterboat stood out like an inkblot on\na bridal gown. I climbed in, started the engine, and released the\nmagnetic anchor that held the little boat to the surface of the\nnickel-iron planetoid. I lifted her gently, worked her around until I\nwas stationary in relation to the spinning planetoid, oriented myself\nagainst the stellar background, and headed toward the first blinker\nbeacon on my way to Ceres.\n  \n \n  For obvious economical reasons, it it impracticable to use full-sized\nspaceships in the Belt. A flitterboat, with a single gravitoinertial\nengine and the few necessities of life\u2014air, some water, and a very\nlittle food\u2014still costs more than a Rolls-Royce\n  [11]\n  automobile does on\nEarth, but there has to be some sort of individual transportation in\nthe Belt.\n  \n \n  They can't be used for any great distances because a man can't stay\nin a vac suit very long without getting uncomfortable. You have to\nhop from beacon to beacon, which means that your\n   \n   average\n   \n  velocity\ndoesn't amount to much, since you spend too much time accelerating\nand decelerating. But a flitterboat is enough to get around the\nneighborhood in, and that's all that's needed.\n  \n \n  I got the GM-187 blinker in my sights, eased the acceleration up to one\ngee, relaxed to watch the radar screen while I thought over my coming\nordeal with McGuire.\n  \n \n  Testing spaceships, robotic or any other kind, is strictly not my\nbusiness. The sign on the door of my office in New York says:\n   \n   DANIEL\nOAK, Confidential Expediter\n   \n  ; I'm hired to help other people Get Things\nDone. Usually, if someone came to me with the problem of getting a\nspaceship test-piloted, I'd simply dig up the best test pilot in the\nbusiness, hire him for my client, and forget about everything but\ncollecting my fee. But I couldn't have refused this case if I'd wanted\nto. I'd already been assigned to it by someone a lot more important\nthan Shalimar Ravenhurst.\n  \n \n  Every schoolchild who has taken a course in Government Organization and\nFunction can tell you that the Political Survey Division is a branch of\nthe System Census Bureau of the UN Government, and that its job is to\nevaluate the political activities of\n  [12]\n  various sub-governments all over\nthe System.\n  \n \n  And every one of those poor tykes would be dead wrong.\n  \n \n  The Political Survey Division\n   \n   does\n   \n  evaluate political activity, all\nright, but it is the Secret Service of the UN Government. The vast\nmajority of\n  [13]\n  the System's citizens don't even know the Government has\na Secret Service. I happen to know only because I'm an agent of the\nPolitical Survey Division.\n  \n \n  The PSD was vitally interested in the whole McGuire project. Robots of\nMcGuire's complexity had been built before; the robot that runs the\ntraffic patterns of the American Eastern Seaboard is just as capable\nas McGuire when it comes to handling a tremendous number of variables\nand making decisions on them. But that robot didn't have to be given\norders except in extreme emergencies. Keeping a few million cars moving\nand safe at the same time is actually pretty routine stuff for a robot.\nAnd a traffic robot isn't given orders verbally; it is given any orders\nthat may be necessary via teletype by a trained programming technician.\nThose orders are usually in reference to a change of routing due to\nrepair work on the highways or the like. The robot itself can take care\nof such emergencies as bad weather or even an accident caused by the\nmalfunctioning of an individual automobile.\n  \n \n  McGuire was different. In the first place, he was mobile. He was in\ncommand of a spacecraft. In a sense, he\n   \n   was\n   \n  the spacecraft, since it\nserved him in a way that was analogous to the way a human body serves\nthe human mind. And he wasn't in charge of millions of objects with a\ntop velocity of a hundred and fifty miles an hour; he was in charge\nof a single object that moved at velocities of thousands of miles per\nsecond. Nor\n  [14]\n  did he have a set, unmoving highway as his path; his paths\nwere variable and led through the emptiness of space.\n  \n \n  Unforeseen emergencies can happen at any time in space, most of them\nhaving to do with the lives of passengers. A cargo ship would be\nsomewhat less susceptible to such emergencies if there were no humans\naboard; it doesn't matter much to a robot if he has no air in his hull.\n  \n \n  But with passengers aboard, there may be times when it would be\nnecessary to give orders\u2014\n   \n   fast\n   \n  ! And that means verbal orders, orders\nthat can be given anywhere in the ship and relayed immediately by\nmicrophone to the robot's brain. A man doesn't have time to run to a\nteletyper and type out orders when there's an emergency in space.\n  \n \n  That meant that McGuire had to understand English, and, since there has\nto be feedback in communication, he had to be able to speak it as well.\n  \n \n  And that made McGuire more than somewhat difficult to deal with.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  The Gravity Business\n  \n \n  By JAMES E. GUNN\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ASHMAN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy January 1956.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   This little alien beggar could dictate his own terms, but how could\nhe\u2014and how could anyone find out what those terms might be?\n   \n \n \n \n  The flivver descended vertically toward the green planet circling the\nold, orange sun.\n  \n \n  It was a spaceship, but not the kind men had once dreamed about. The\nflivver was shaped like a crude bullet, blunt at one end of a fat\ncylinder and tapering abruptly to a point at the other. It had been\nslapped together out of sheet metal and insulation board, and it sold,\nfully equipped, for $15,730. It didn't behave like a spaceship, either.\n  \n \n  As it hurtled down, its speed increased with dramatic swiftness. Then,\nat the last instant before impact, it stopped. Just like that.\n  \n \n  A moment later, it thumped a last few inches into the ankle-deep grass\nand knee-high white flowers of the meadow. It was a shock of a jar that\nmade the sheet-metal walls boom like thunder machines. The flivver\nrocked unsteadily on its flat stern before it decided to stay upright.\n  \n \n  Then all was quiet\u2014outside.\n  \n \n  Inside the big, central cabin, Grampa waved his pircuit irately in the\nair. \"Now look what you made me do! Just when I had the blamed thing\npractically whipped, too!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They watched the parabola it made in its trajectory as it flashed into\nspace and then fell into orbit there beyond the planetary attraction of\nVenus. On the three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncannily real.\n  \n \n  A flight that had taken many hours to accomplish, was shortened on\nthe viso-screen to a matter of minutes. They saw the great, proud\ninterplanetary transport speeding majestically through the starry void,\nand suddenly, they saw her swerve in a great arc; again she swerved\nas if avoiding something deadly in space, and point upwards gaining\naltitude. It was zig-zagging now, desperately maneuvering in an erratic\ncourse, and as if by magic, a tiny spot appeared on the transport's\nside.\n  \n \n  Tiny on the viso-screen, the fatal spots must have been huge in\nactuality. To the Commander of the I.S.P., and to Captain Brooke, it\nwas an old story. Atom-blasts were pitting the spacer's hull with\ndeadly Genton shells. The great transport trembled under the impact of\nthe barrage, and suddenly, the screen went blank.\n  \n \n  Commander Bertram turned slowly to face the young I.S.P. captain, whose\nfeatures were a mask devoid of all expression now, save for the pallor\nand the burning fire in his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"And that's the sixth one in a month. Sometimes the survivors reach\nTerra in emergency spacers, or are picked up in space by other\ntransports ... and sometimes son ... well, as you know, sometimes\nthey're never seen again.\"\n  \n \n  \"When do I leave, Commander!\" Dennis Brooke's voice was like a javelin\nof ice.\n  \n \n  \"Right now, if you wish. We have a new cruiser armored in beryloid with\ndouble hull\u2014a new design against Genton shells, but it's the speed\nof the thing that you'll want to know about. It just about surpasses\nanything ever invented. Get the figures and data from the coordination\nroom, son; it's serviced and fueled and the crew's aboard.\" He\nextended his hand. \"You're the best spacer we have\u2014aside from your\nrecklessness\u2014and on your success depends far more than the capture of\nan outlaw.\" Bertram smiled thinly. \"Happy landing!\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Their nerves were ragged. Days and days of fruitless search for a\nphantom ship that seemed to have vanished from space, and an equally\nelusive pirate whose whereabouts were hidden in the depths of\nfathomless space.\n  \n \n  To all but Captain Brooke, this was a new adventure, their first\nassignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the\ninner planets, where men spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance\nagainst stray asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless vandal ships. Even\ntheir cruiser was a new experience, the long, tapering fighter lacked\nthe luxurious offices and appointments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol\nspacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was\nhoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was a\nthing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty instinct with power, not the\ncomfortable luxury that they knew.\n  \n \n  Day after day they went through their drills, donning space suits,\nmanning battle stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at empty space, and\neternally scanning the vast empty reaches by means of the telecast.\n  \n \n  And suddenly, out of the void, as they had all but given up the search\nas a wild goose chase, a speck was limned in the lighted surface of the\nviso-screen in the control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser came to\nlife. In a burst of magnificent speed, the cruiser literally devoured\nthe space leagues, until the spacer became a flashing streak. On the\nviso-screen, the speck grew larger, took on contours, growing and\nbecoming slowly the drifting shell of what had been a transport.\n  \n \n  Presently they were within reaching distance, and Captain Brooke\ncommanded through the teleradio from the control room:\n  \n \n  \"Prepare to board!\"\n  \n \n  Every member of the crew wanted to be among the boarding party, for\nall but George Randall, the junior member of the crew had served his\napprenticeship among the inner planets, Mars, Venus and Terra. He felt\nnauseated at the very thought of going out there in that vast abyss of\nspace. His young, beardless face, with the candid blue eyes went pale\nwhen the order was given. But presently, Captain Brooke named those who\nwere to go beside himself:\n  \n \n  \"You, Tom and Scotty, take one emergency plane, and Dallas!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Captain!\" Dallas Bernan, the immense third lieutenant boomed in\nhis basso-profundo voice.\n  \n \n  \"You and I'll take a second emergency!\" There was a pause in the voice\nof the Captain from the control room, then: \"Test space suits. Test\noxygen helmets! Atom-blasts only, ready in five minutes!\"\n  \n \n  George Randall breathed a sigh of relief. He watched them bridge the\nspace to the drifting wreck, then saw them enter what had once been a\nproud interplanetary liner, now soon to be but drifting dust, and he\nturned away with a look of shame.\n  \n \n  Inside the liner, Captain Dennis Brooke had finished making a detailed\nsurvey.\n  \n \n  \"No doubt about it,\" he spoke through the radio in his helmet. \"Cargo\nmissing. No survivors. No indication that the repulsion fields were\nout of order. And finally, those Genton shells could only have been\nfired by Koerber!\" He tried to maintain a calm exterior, but inwardly\nhe seethed in a cold fury more deadly than any he had ever experienced.\nSomehow he had expected to find at least one compartment unharmed,\nwhere life might have endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only a great\nresolve to deal with Koerber once and for all remained to him.\n  \n \n  Dennis tried not to think of Marla, too great an ache was involved in\nthinking of her and all he had lost. When he finally spoke, his voice\nwas harsh, laconic:\n  \n \n  \"Prepare to return!\"\n  \n \n  Scotty Byrnes, the cruiser's nurse, who could take his motors through a\nmajor battle, or hell and high water and back again, for that matter,\nshifted the Venusian weed that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek and\ngazed curiously at Captain Brooke. They all knew the story in various\nversions, and with special additions. But they were spacemen, implicit\nin their loyalty, and with Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe.\n  \n \n  Tom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-faced Navigator, whose slow,\neasygoing movements belied the feral persistence of a tiger, and the\nswiftness of a striking cobra in a fight, led the small procession of\nmen toward the emergency planes. Behind him came Dallas Bernan, third\nlieutenant, looming like a young asteroid in his space suit, followed\nby Scotty, and finally Captain Brooke himself. All left in silence, as\nif the tragedy that had occurred aboard the wrecked liner, had touched\nthem intimately.\n  \n"

He was\nsmart\u2014but incredibly foolish. And, as a natural consequence, tended to\nask questions too profound for any philosopher\u2014questions like \"Who are\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  By RANDALL GARRETT\n  \n \n \n  I'd been in Ravenhurst's office on the mountain-sized planetoid called\nRaven's Rest only twice before. The third time was no better; Shalimar\nRavenhurst was one of the smartest operators in the Belt, but when it\ncame to personal relationships, he was utterly incompetent. He could\nmake anyone dislike him without trying.\n  \n \n  When I entered the office, he was\n  [3]\n  sitting behind his mahogany desk,\nhis eyes focused on the operation he was going through with a wineglass\nand a decanter. He didn't look up at me as he said:\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Mr. Oak. Will you have some Madeira?\"\n  \n \n  I decided I might as well observe the pleasantries. There was no point\nin my getting nasty until he did. \"Thank you, Mr. Ravenhurst, I will.\"\n  \n \n  He kept his eyes focused on his work: It isn't easy to pour wine on a\nplanetoid where the gee-pull is measured in fractions of a centimeter\nper second squared. It moves slowly, like ropy molasses, but you have\nto be careful not to be fooled by that. The viscosity is just as low\nas ever, and if you pour it from any great height, it will go scooting\nright out of the glass\n  [4]\n  again. The momentum it builds up is enough to\nmake it splash right out again in a slow-motion gush which gets it all\nover the place.\n  \n \n  Besides which, even if it didn't splash, it would take it so long to\nfall a few inches that you'd die of thirst waiting for it.\n  \n \n  Ravenhurst had evolved a technique from long years of practice.\nHe tilted the glass and the bottle toward each other, their edges\ntouching, like you do when you're trying to pour beer without putting a\nhead on it. As soon as the wine wet the glass, the adhesive forces at\nwork would pull more wine into the wine glass. To get capillary action\non a low-gee asteroid, you don't need a capillary, by any means. The\nnegative meniscus on the wine was something to see; the first time\nyou see it, you get the eerie feeling that the glass is spinning and\nthrowing the wine up against the walls by centrifugal force.\n  \n \n  I took the glass he offered me (Careful! Don't slosh!) and sipped at\nit. Using squirt tubes would have been a hell of a lot easier and\nneater, but Ravenhurst liked to do things his way.\n  \n \n  He put the stopper back in the decanter, picked up his own glass and\nsipped appreciatively. Not until he put it back down on the desk again\ndid he raise his eyes and look at me for the first time since I'd come\nin.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak, you have caused me considerable trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought we'd hashed all that out, Mr. Ravenhurst,\" I said, keeping\nmy voice level.\n  \n \n  [5]\n  \n \n  \"So had I. But it appears that there were more ramifications to your\naction than we had at first supposed.\" His voice had the texture of\nheavy linseed oil.\n  \n \n  He waited, as if he expected me to make some reply to that. When\nI didn't, he sighed slightly and went on. \"I fear that you have\ninadvertently sabotaged McGuire. You were commissioned to prevent\nsabotage, Mr. Oak, and I'm afraid that you abrogated your contract.\"\n  \n \n  I just continued to keep my voice calm. \"If you are trying to get back\nthe fee you gave me, we can always take it to court. I don't think\nyou'd win.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Oak,\" he said heavily, \"I am not a fool, regardless of what your\nown impression may be. If I were trying to get back that fee, I would\nhardly offer to pay you another one.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't think he was a fool. You don't get into the managerial\nbusiness and climb to the top and stay there unless you have brains.\nRavenhurst was smart, all right; it was just that, when it came to\npersonal relationships, he wasn't very wise.\n  \n \n  \"Then stop all this yak about an abrogated contract and get to the\npoint,\" I told him.\n  \n \n  \"I shall. I was merely trying to point out to you that it is through\nyour own actions that I find myself in a very trying position, and that\nyour sense of honor and ethics should induce you to rectify the damage.\"\n  \n \n  \"My honor and ethics are in fine shape,\" I said, \"but my interpretation\nof the concepts might not be quite\n  [6]\n  the same as yours. Get to the\npoint.\"\n  \n \n  He took another sip of Madeira. \"The robotocists at Viking tell\nme that, in order to prevent any further ... ah ... sabotage by\nunauthorized persons, the MGYR-7 was constructed so that, after\nactivation, the first man who addressed orders to it would thenceforth\nbe considered its ... ah ... master.\n  \n \n  \"As I understand it, the problem of defining the term 'human being'\nunambiguously to a robot is still unsolved. The robotocists felt that\nit would be much easier to define a single individual. That would\nprevent the issuing of conflicting orders to a robot, provided the\nsingle individual were careful in giving orders himself.\n  \n \n  \"Now, it appears that\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Mr. Oak, were the first man to speak to\nMcGuire after he had been activated. Is that correct?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that question purely rhetorical,\" I asked him, putting on my best\nexpression of innocent interest. \"Or are you losing your memory?\" I had\nexplained all that to him two weeks before, when I'd brought McGuire\nand the girl here, so that Ravenhurst would have a chance to cover up\nwhat had really happened.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  AMBITION\n  \n \n  By WILLIAM L.

Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit.

He could not quite explain the\nfeelings within him; they were so alien, so unnatural. But ever since\nthe engines somewhere in the rear of the world had changed their tone,\nfrom the steady whining Rikud had heard all twenty-five years of his\nlife, to the sullen roar that came to his ears now, the feelings had\ngrown.\n  \n \n  If anyone else had noticed the change, he failed to mention it. This\ndisturbed Rikud, although he could not tell why. And, because he had\nrealized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside\nhim.\n  \n \n  Today, space looked somehow different. The stars\u2014it was a meaningless\nconcept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright\npinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport\u2014were not\napparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead,\nthere was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart\nby itself in the middle of the viewport.\n  \n \n  If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was\nodd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was\u2014it was\u2014what\nwas it?\n  \n \n  Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and\ngreeted gray-haired old Chuls.\n  \n \n  \"In five more years,\" the older man chided, \"you'll be ready to sire\nchildren. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.\"\n  \n \n  Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the\nhealth-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it;\nhe just didn't, without comprehending.\n  \n \n  Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the\ntime he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select\nas his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud\nignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling\nhe could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man\nhad? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always\nembroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a\nheadache?\n  \n \n  Chuls said, \"It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here\nand knew it was your time, too....\"\n  \n \n  His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not\nexplain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it had\ndeparted almost before Chuls knew of its existence.\n  \n \n  \"I'll go with you,\" Rikud told him.\n  \n"

        "  DEATH STAR\n  \n \n  By TOM PACE\n  \n \n  Trapped by the most feared of space pirates\n   \n  Devil Garrett, Starrett Blade was fighting for\n   \n  his life. Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\n   \n  pinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Starrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\n  \n \n  Ten minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\n  \n \n  For eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\n  \n \n  That Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\n  \n \n  However, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\n  \n \n  It wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\n  \n \n  His fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\n  \n \n  The man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\n  \n \n  Star landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\n  \n \n  The stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\n  \n \n  Star tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\n  \n \n  He got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\n  \n \n  While a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\n  \n \n  If his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\n  \n \n  Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\n   \n   pirate\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\n  \n \n  The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\n  \n \n  Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\n  \n \n  Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\n  \n \n  An eternity seemed to pass.\n  \n \n  Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\n  \n \n  Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\n  \n \n  The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\n  \n \n  He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile. He said,\n\"Ah, Mr. Garrett.\"\n  \n \n  Star's jaw dropped. \"Garrett? What do you\u2014\" he broke off. A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity. There is no need to attempt to fool\nus.... I've known it was you ever since I flashed that beam at your\nship. And you needn't flatter yourself that the Devil's luck is going\nto hold out as far as you are concerned. For in a very short while,\nI'm going to have you executed ... before a stellar vision screen,\nconnected with Section Void Headquarters! I wish the authorities to see\nDevil Garrett die, so that I might collect the reward that is offered\non you!\"\n  \n \n  Star stood quiet, and looked straight into Garrett's eyes. After a\nminute of silence, Garrett's lips twisted into a smile, and he said\nmockingly, \"Well, pirate? What are you thinking of?\"\n  \n \n  Star said, in a low, cold voice, \"I'm thinking of putting an electron\nfire-blade into your face, Devil Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Garrett laughed ... huge, rather evil, bluff laughter. The mirth of a\nperson who is both powerful and dangerous. And then the girl leaped\nforward, shaking with rage.\n  \n \n  \"You beast! Murderer! To accuse this man ... you fool, you might have\nbeen able to complete any scheme of escape you had, if you hadn't\ncalled yourself Starrett Blade! Mr. Blade....\" She gestured toward\nGarrett, who made a mocking, sardonic bow. \"... has given me ample\nproof that he is who he says! And this long before you came. He's shown\nme papers giving a description and showing a tri-dimension picture of\nyou....\"\n  \n \n  Fire leaped in Star's eyes. \"Listen ...\" he snapped furiously, as he\nstarted to step forward. Then Garrett made a signal with his hand, and\nsomeone drove a fist against the base of Star's skull.\n  \n"

        "  DEATH STAR\n  \n \n  By TOM PACE\n  \n \n  Trapped by the most feared of space pirates\n   \n  Devil Garrett, Starrett Blade was fighting for\n   \n  his life. Weaponless, his ship gone, he was\n   \n  pinning his hopes on a girl\u2014who wanted him dead.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Starrett Blade crouched in the rocks by the tiny Centaurian lake. It\nwas only about two or three hundred feet across, but probably thousands\nof feet deep. This lake, and hundreds of others like it, were the\nonly things to break the monotony of the flat, rocky surface of Alpha\nCentauri III\u2014called the most barren planet in space.\n  \n \n  Ten minutes ago, Star Blade's ship had spun into the stagnant waters\nbefore him. An emergency release had flung the air-lock doors open, and\nthe air pressure had flung Star out. And now he was waiting for Devil\nGarrett to come down to the water's edge to search for him.\n  \n \n  For eight years, Devil Garrett had been the top space pirate in the\nvoid. For a year, Star himself had personally been hunting him. And on\na tour over Alpha III, a Barden energy-beam had stabbed up at Blade's\nship, and Star Blade had crashed into the lake.\n  \n \n  That Barden Beam had Star worried and puzzled. It took a million volts\nof power for a split-second flash of the beam. Garrett didn't have an\natomics plant on Alpha III\u2014if he had, escaping rays would point it\nout, no matter how well it was camouflaged. There was no water power,\nfor there was no running water. There were only the lakes ... and tidal\npower was out, for Alpha III had no moon.\n  \n \n  However, that could wait. Star slid the electron knife from his\nwater-proof sheath, gripped it firmly. He could hear quick footsteps as\na man came down the trail that led directly past his hiding place.\n  \n \n  It wasn't Garrett, which was disappointing. But it was one of his men,\nand he was heavily armed. That didn't worry Star.\n  \n \n  His fighting had earned Starrett Blade the nickname of \"Death Star.\"\n  \n \n  The man walked to the water's edge, and peered out over the pool. He\nsaw the bubbles that were coming up from the sinking ship, and he\nnodded, grunted in satisfaction, and started to turn back.\n  \n \n  Star landed on him, knocking him sprawling on the rock. The pirate\njerked up an arm, holding the jet-gun.\n  \n \n  The stabbing lance of blue fire cracked from the electron knife, dug\ninto the man's heart.\n  \n \n  Star tossed the dead pirate's cloak over his shoulders, and thrust both\nelectron blade and jet-gun into his belt. He straightened, and saw the\nleveled gun from the corner of his eye.\n  \n \n  He got the jet in his right hand, the knife in his left, and went into\na dive that flipped him behind a rock. The three actions took only a\nsplit-second, and the blast from the jet-gun flaked rock where he had\nbeen standing.\n  \n \n  While a jet-gun is the most deadly weapon known, you have to press a\nloading stud to slide another blast-capsule into place. Death Star knew\nthis very well. So he knew he was safe in coming up from behind the\nspur of stone to fire his own gun.\n  \n \n  If his reflexes hadn't been as quick as they were, he would have\nblasted the girl.\n  \n<doc-sep>When Star came to, he was in a cell of sorts. A man standing by the\ndoor told him that he was to be executed, \"... after Mr. Blade and the\nlady have eaten.\" Starrett swore at him, and the man went out, with a\nmocking \"Goodbye, Mr. Garrett!\"\n  \n \n  Star got up. His head spun, and he almost fell at first, but the daze\nleft in his head from the two blows quickly cleared away. He felt for\nvarious weapons which he had hidden about him ... and found them gone.\nGarrett's men had searched carefully.\n  \n \n  Star sat down, his head spinning more now from mystery than from\nphysical pain. He had to keep himself in a whole skin, of course. That\nwas most important right now. But other things were bothering him,\ntugging at his mind like waves slapping around a swamped ship, each\ntrying to shove it in a different direction.\n  \n \n  There was the girl. Star wondered why she always leaped into his mind\nfirst. And there was the way Garrett was trying to leave the impression\nthat he was Blade, so that he could kill Blade as Garrett.\n  \n \n  Obviously, the reason for that was the girl, Miss Hinton, Garrett had\ncalled her. She had been shown faked papers by Garrett, papers proving\nthat the two were ... were whatever Garrett had twisted the story into!\n  \n \n  Star clutched at his head. He was in a mess. He was going to be killed,\nand he was going to die without knowing the score. And he didn't like\nthat. Nor did he like dying as Star Blade shouldn't die; executed as\na \"wolf's-head\" pirate. The girl would be watching, and he felt as if\nthat would make it far worse.\n  \n \n  His head came up, and he smiled flintily. He still had an ace card! One\nhand felt for it, and he shook his head slowly. It was a gamble ... but\nall the others had been found.\n  \n \n  Blade looked up quickly, as the door opened. Two men came into the\ncell, carrying jet-guns. They motioned Blade to his feet. \"Come on,\nBlade.\" One began, when the other hit him across the mouth.\n  \n \n  \"You fool!\" he hissed. \"You better not call him that; suppose that\ngirl was to hear it? Until the boss gets what he wants on Earth, that\ngirl has got to think that he's Blade! We're killing this guy as Devil\nGarrett! And a loud-mouthed fool like you ... look out!\"\n  \n \n  Blade had landed on the bickering men, and was grappling with the one\nwho had called him by name. As the other leaped forward, swinging a\nclubbing blow with a jet-gun, Star tripped one man into the corner, and\nducked under the gun. He hit the man in the stomach, drove a shoulder\nup under his arms, and smashed the man's face in with a series of sharp\nblows. The man went reeling backward across the room, and Star's hand\nleaped toward that \"ace card\" which he still held.\n  \n \n  Devil Garrett stepped in the door, and made a mock out of a courteous\nbow. As he did so, Star snarled in rage, but stood very still, for the\nelectron knife in Garrett's hand did not waver.\n  \n \n  Garrett gestured silently toward the door, and Star, equally silent,\nwalked over and out, at the point of the weapon.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Okay,\" threw back Star and the man appeared in the doorway, empty\nhands held high. After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n"

She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\n  \n \n  Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\n   \n   pirate\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\n  \n \n  The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\n  \n \n  Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\n  \n \n  Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\n  \n \n  An eternity seemed to pass.\n  \n \n  Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\n  \n \n  Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water.

A glance at\nthe girl told him what the purpose was.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Mr. Devil Garrett,\" said the pirate, still smiling softly, \"Miss\nHinton is aware of your identity.

After a second, the other joined him.\n  \n \n  Anne turned to Star. \"Now I know why they call you 'Death Star' Blade,\"\nshe said, and gestured toward the men who had surrendered, and the two\nwhom Starrett had shot down.\n  \n \n  He mused there for a minute. Then Anne broke the silence with, \"Star,\nwhat are we going to do now? Garrett's men will be up here in a little\nwhile. We can't get to a sub-space beam. What are we going to do when\nthey come up to investigate?\"\n  \n \n  Starrett Blade laughed. \"Do? Well, we could turn them over to Commander\nWeddel!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Grinning broadly, Star pointed, with a flourish, at the door. Anne\nspun about, and found Commander Weddel grinning in the door from the\ncorridor.\n  \n \n  \"Very simple,\" said Star across the lounge to Anne. \"When I smashed\nthe vision set with that dinner fork, I broke a small unit which is\nincluded in all sets. You know, a direction finder doesn't work, except\nin the liner-beam principle, in space, because of the diffusing effect\nof unrestricted cosmic rays.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I knew that,\" said Anne. \"But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Starrett grinned again. \"A type of beam has been found which it is\nimpossible for cosmics to disturb. But you can't send messages on\nit, so it is made in a little unit on every set. If that unit is\nbroken, the set automatically releases a signal beam. This is a\ndistress signal, and the location of the set that sent out the signal\nis recorded at the Section Headquarters. When Commander Weddel saw\nme throw something at the set, and it went dead, he looked at the\nautomatic record, and found out that a signal had been sent in from\na location on Alpha Cen's third planet. Then he had a high-velocity\ncruiser brought out and dropped in, in time to pick up some pieces.\" He\nstopped, and idly toyed with a sheaf of papers, then held them up. \"See\nthese papers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh. What are they, Star?\"\n  \n \n  \"They are the main plans of Devil Garrett's power plant, and they're\nthe one good thing he's ever done. These plans are going to bring the\nbarren, rocky Centauri planets to life!\"\n  \n \n  He got up, and paced to the window, and stood there, looking out, and\nup through the plastic port. \"The planets of Centauri!\" he murmured\nsoftly. \"Seven circling Alpha alone. And all seven are barren, rocky,\nlevel except for the thousands of lakes ... lakes that are going to be\nthe life of Centauri!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He stopped, and stood for a second, staring at the girl. She was\nsomething to invite stares, too. In the moment that lasted between her\nnext move, he had time to register that she was about five feet five\ntall, black-haired\u2014the kind of black hair that looks like silken spun\ndarkness\u2014dark-eyed, and possessing both a face and a form that would\nmake anyone stop and gulp.\n  \n \n  Then the moment of half-awed survey was over, and she leveled the jet\non him, and said in a trembling voice, \"Drop those weapons, or I'll\nblast you ...\n   \n   pirate\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Death Star said, \"That jet-gun is empty. I can see the register on the\nmagazine. And I'm not a pirate. I'm Starrett Blade.\"\n  \n \n  The useless jet-gun slid out of the girl's hand, and she gave a\nhalf-gasp. \"Starrett Blade! I\u2014I don't believe ...\" she broke off\nabruptly. \"So you're Death Star! A fine story for a hired killer, a\npirate.\"\n  \n \n  Star reddened. \"Look,\" he snapped, \"I don't know who's been talking to\nyou, but ...\" he whirled, and his hand whipped the jet-gun from his\nbelt. As he did so, the girl jerked up the jet-gun she had dropped, and\nflung it with all her strength. The blow landed on his arm and side,\nand paralyzed him long enough for the man who had leaped out behind him\nto land a stunning blow against his head. As Star went down, he dizzily\ncursed himself for becoming interested in the argument with the girl,\nso that he did not heed his reflexes in time ... and dimly, he wondered\nwhy it had seemed so important to convince the lovely dark-haired girl.\n  \n \n  Then a bit of the cosmos seemed to fall on Star's head, and he was\nhurled into blackness.\n  \n \n  An eternity seemed to pass.\n  \n \n  Deep in the blackness, a light was born. It leaped toward him, a\nfar-away comet rocketing along, coming from some far, unknown corner\nof the galaxy. It became a flaming sun in a gray-green space, and\nstrangely, there seemed to be several odd planets circling about the\nsun. Some of them were vast pieces of queer electronic machinery. Some\nwere vague, villainous-looking men. One was the dark-haired girl, and\nthere was lovely contempt in her dark-star pools of eyes.\n  \n \n  Then into the midst of this queer universe, there swam a new planet. It\nwas the face of a man, and the man was Devil Garrett.\n  \n \n  That brought Star up, out of his daze, onto his feet as though he had\nbeen doused with cold water. He stood there, not staring, just looking\nat Garrett.\n  \n \n  The most famous killer in the void was big. He was six feet three, and\ntwice as strong as he looked. He wore a huge high-velocity jet-gun, and\na set of electron knives, all of the finest workmanship. He was sitting\non a laboratory chair of steel, and the chair bent slightly under his\ngreat weight.\n  \n \n  He smiled at Star, and there was a touch of hell in the smile.

The\nLatin translated as \"the Sea of Serenity.\" It was well named because,\nas far as the eye could see in every direction, there was a smooth\nlayer of pumice that resembled the surface of a calm sea. Scattered\nacross the quiet sea of virgin Moon dust were occasional islands\nof rock that jutted abruptly toward the infinity of stars above.\nConsidering everything, our surroundings conveyed a sense of serenity\nlike none I had ever felt.\n  \n \n  Our bounding path across the level expanse was clearly marked. Because\nof the light gravity, we had leaped high into the air with each step\nand every time we struck the ground, the impact had raised a cloud of\ndustlike pumice. Now the clouds of dust were slowly settling in the\nlight gravity.\n  \n \n  Above us, the stars were cold, motionless and crystal-clear.\nIndifferently, they sprayed a faint light on our surroundings ... a\ndim glow that was hardly sufficient for normal vision and was too weak\nto be reflected toward Earth.\n  \n \n  We turned our head-lamps on the strange object before us. Five beams\nof light illuminated the smooth shape that protruded from the Moon's\nsurface.\n  \n \n  The incongruity was so awesome that for several minutes, we remained\nmotionless and quiet. Miller broke the silence with his quavering\nvoice, \"Strange someone didn't notice it before.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Purnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\nimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know\nwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\nwiggled in anticipation.\n  \n \n  He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\nit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\nsurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\nNever before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\nprotect himself.\n  \n \n  He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\nattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\nhad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\ninto the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n  \n \n  The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\nand at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\nHe picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\nfew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\nto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\ndeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n  \n \n  \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n  \n \n  \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's\nall. Now pick him up.\"\n  \n \n  The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.\nWhat had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\nagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\npower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\nfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\ndirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\nordered the stoppage of time.\n  \n \n  The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\nmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\ntransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\nhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\nto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\nwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\nhe might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\nin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\nend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.\nHe hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\nhissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\nBefore starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\nto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\nexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\nstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\nthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n  \n \n  Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\ntorn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\ncountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\nanimals.\n  \n \n  Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\nwith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\nwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit\ninto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\nlong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\ndidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\nfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\nabused this faculty.\n  \n<doc-sep>When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\n  \n \n  I was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\n  \n \n  Kane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n  \n \n  \"Awake, huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n  \n \n  \"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your plan?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\n  \n \n  I grunted my disgust.\n  \n \n  \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n  \n \n  \"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Right.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n  \n \n  \"What remark?\"\n  \n \n  \"It said, '\n   \n   My\n   \n  masters will be displeased with\n   \n   me\n   \n  if you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.'

It had come much further than Steve had\nexpected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he\nescaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the\nKumaji encampment by now.\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't seem badly damaged,\" Mary said.\n  \n \n  The platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of\nthe rotors twisted, its end buried in sand. Tobias Whiting wasn't there.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Steve said. \"It's hardly damaged at all. Your father got out of it\nall right.\"\n  \n \n  \"To go\u2014to them?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so, Mary. I don't want to pass judgment until we're sure. I'm\nsorry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Steve! Steve! What will we do? What\n   \n   can\n   \n  we do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Find him, if it isn't too late. Come on.\"\n  \n \n  \"North?\"\n  \n \n  \"North.\"\n  \n \n  \"And if by some miracle we find him?\"\n  \n \n  Steve said nothing. The answer\u2014capture or death\u2014was obvious. But you\ncouldn't tell that to a traitor's daughter, could you?\n  \n \n  As it turned out, they did not find Tobias Whiting through their own\nefforts. Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were\nspotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on\ntheir\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  . Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel\naside. \"They'd kill us,\" he said. \"We can only surrender.\"\n  \n \n  They were hobbled and led painfully across the sand. They were taken\nthat way to a small Kumaji encampment, and thrust within a circular\ntent.\n  \n \n  Tobias Whiting was in there.\n  \n<doc-sep>The warriors inside the bubble stared in stupid astonishment after the\none who had disappeared from their view. The sorcerer leaped about,\npushing them in his direction.\n  \n \n  Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged\nfrom the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.\n  \n \n  \"The safeguards are now energized,\" the interpreter said.\n  \n \n  A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row\nof the audience.\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step\nforward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his\nleft shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his\nright hand.\n  \n \n  \"I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!\"\nthe interpreter enjoined.\n  \n \n  In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the\nButcher yelled a \"Hey!\" of disapproval, snatched up something from the\nfloor and darted out through the sphincter.\n  \n \n  Here and there in the audience, other adults stood up. The emerged\nwarriors formed a ring of swinging swords and questing eyes. Between\ntheir legs their wolfish dogs, emerged with them, crouched and snarled.\nThen the warriors began to fan out.\n  \n \n  \"There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,\" the\ninterpreter said. \"Please be patient.\"\n  \n \n  At that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a\nlevitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At\nhis heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization\nvoice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: \"Hey,\nyou! You quit that!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to\nquiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his\nsword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range.\nThen his sword swished down in a flashing arc.\n  \n \n  Next moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring\nat him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible\nan arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed\na step.\n  \n \n \n \n  The Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and\ndigging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. \"Sic\n'em, Brute!\" he shrilled. \"Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie\nand Blue!\" Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth.\n  \n"

        "When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly. I wasn't in the compartment where I had fallen\nasleep a few hours before.\n  \n \n  I was tied to one of the chairs in the \"kitchen.\" Beside me, Verana was\nbound to a chair by strips of cloth from her skirt, and across from us,\nMarie was secured to another chair.\n  \n \n  Kane staggered into the room. Although he was visibly drunk, he\nappeared more sober than the night before. His dark hair was rumpled\nand his face was flushed, but his eyes gleamed with a growing alertness.\n  \n \n  \"Awake, huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"What have you done, Harry?\" his wife screamed at him. Her eyes were\nred with tears and her lips twisted in an expression of shame when she\nlooked at him.\n  \n \n  \"Obvious, isn't it? While all of you were asleep, I conked each of you\non the head, dragged you in here and tied you up.\" He smiled crookedly.\n\"It's amazing the things a person can do when he's pickled. I'm sorry I\nhad to be so rough, but I have a plan and I knew you wouldn't agree or\ncooperate with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your plan?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly and crinkled bloodshot eyes. \"I don't want to live in\na zoo on an alien planet. I want to go home and prove my theory that\nthis problem has a solution.\"\n  \n \n  I grunted my disgust.\n  \n \n  \"The solution is simple,\" he said. \"We're in a trap so strong that the\naliens didn't establish any means to control our actions. When men put\na lion in a strong cage, they don't worry about controlling the lion\nbecause the lion can't get out. We're in the same basic situation.\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\" Verana queried in a sarcastic tone.\n  \n \n  \"The aliens want us transported to their planet so they can examine and\nquestion us. Right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Right.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed, remember that remark the machine made last night?\"\n  \n \n  \"What remark?\"\n  \n \n  \"It said, '\n   \n   My\n   \n  masters will be displeased with\n   \n   me\n   \n  if you arrive in a\ndamaged condition.' What does that indicate to you?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Six rooms were open to our use. The two rooms in which the Kanes had\nbeen imprisoned were locked and there were no controls or locks to work\non.\n  \n \n  The rooms that we could enter were without doors, except the ones that\nopened into the corridor.\n  \n \n  After intensive searching, we realized there was\n   \n   no way\n   \n  to damage the\nship or reach any section other than our allotted space.\n  \n \n  We gave up.\n  \n \n  The women went to the sleeping compartments to rest and Kane I went to\nthe \"kitchen.\"\n  \n \n  At random, we sampled the variously colored boxes and bottles and\ndiscussed our predicament.\n  \n \n  \"Trapped,\" Kane said angrily. \"Trapped in a steel prison.\" He slammed\nhis fist against the table top. \"But there must be a way to get out!\nEvery problem has a solution!\"\n  \n \n  \"You sure?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Does\n   \n  every problem have a solution? I don't believe it. Some\nproblems are too great. Take the problem of a murderer in our\ncivilization: John Doe has killed someone and his problem is to escape.\nPrimarily, a murderer's problem is the same principle as ours. A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw. Damned\nfew criminals get away these days, even though they've got such crowds\nto lose themselves in. All we have is a ship that we can't control. I\ndon't think we have a chance.\"\n  \n \n  My resignation annoyed him. Each of us had reacted differently: Kane's\nwife was frightened, Verana was calm because of an inner serenity that\nfew people have, I was resigned and Kane was angry.\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n   \n   thlot's\n   \n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n  \n \n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n  \n \n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\nmake a mistake, can't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\"\n  \n \n  Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\nreach Oasis City in safety.\n  \n \n  With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\n  \n"

They left this ship on\nyour Moon only because they were curious. My masters have no animosity\ntoward your race, only compassion and curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  I remembered the way antigravity rays had shoved Miller from the ship\nand asked the machine, \"Why didn't you let our fifth member board the\nship?\"\n  \n \n  \"The trip to my makers' planet will take six months. There are food,\noxygen and living facilities for four only of your race.

We had no tools to\nforce our way through solid metal walls to the engine or control rooms.\nThe only things in the ship that could be lifted and carried about were\nthe containers of food and alien games. None were sufficiently heavy or\nhard enough to put even a scratch in the heavy metal.\n  \n<doc-sep>Her voice seemed to come from far away, but she was standing right\nbeside him, tall and bewitching; Helenesque as ever. Her blue eyes\nbecame great wells into which he found himself falling. With an effort,\nhe pulled himself back. \"You're early tonight,\" he said lamely.\n  \n \n  She appropriated the message, read it. \"Put the book back,\" she said\npresently. Then, when he complied: \"Come on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are we going?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm going to deliver a\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  to Jilka. After that I'm going to\ntake you home to meet my folks.\"\n  \n \n  The relieved sigh he heard was his own.\n  \n \n  They climbed into her convertible and she nosed it into the moving line\nof cars. \"How long have you been reading my mail?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Since the night before I met you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Was that the reason you spilled the sugar?\"\n  \n \n  \"Part of the reason,\" he said. \"What's a\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  She laughed. \"I don't think I'd better tell you just yet.\"\n  \n \n  He sighed again. \"But if Jilka wanted a\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  ,\" he said after a\nwhile, \"why in the world didn't she call you up and say so?\"\n  \n \n  \"Regulations.\" She pulled over to the curb in front of a brick\napartment building. \"This is where Jilka lives. I'll explain when I get\nback.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her get out, walk up the walk to the entrance and let\nherself in. He leaned his head back on the seat, lit a cigarette and\nexhaled a mixture of smoke and relief. On the way to meet her folks.\nSo it was just an ordinary secret society after all. And here he'd\nbeen thinking that she was the key figure in a Martian plot to blow up\nEarth\u2014\n  \n \n  Her\n   \n   folks\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Abruptly the full implication of the words got through to him, and he\nsat bolt-up-right on the seat. He was starting to climb out of the car\nwhen he saw Kay coming down the walk. Anyway, running away wouldn't\nsolve his problem. A complete disappearing act was in order, and a\ncomplete disappearing act would take time. Meanwhile he would play\nalong with her.\n  \n"

        "I took Verana's hand and led her down the long corridor, retracing our\nsteps.\n  \n \n  We had walked not more than two yards when the rest of the doors\nopened soundlessly.\n  \n \n  Verana's hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp.\n  \n \n  Six doors were now open. The only two that remained closed were the\nones that the Kanes had unwillingly entered.\n  \n \n  This time, no invisible hand thrust us into any of the rooms.\n  \n \n  I entered the nearest one. Verana followed hesitantly.\n  \n \n  The walls of the large room were lined with shelves containing\nthousands of variously colored boxes and bottles. A table and four\nchairs were located in the center of the green, plasticlike floor. Each\nchair had no back, only a curving platform with a single supporting\ncolumn.\n  \n \n  \"Ed!\" I joined Verana on the other side of the room. She pointed a\ntrembling finger at some crude drawings. \"The things in this room are\nfood!\"\n  \n \n  The drawings were so simple that anyone could have understood them.\nThe first drawing portrayed a naked man and woman removing boxes and\nbottles from the shelves. The second picture showed the couple opening\nthe containers. The third showed the man eating from one of the boxes\nand the woman drinking from a bottle.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Let's see how it tastes,\" I said.\n  \n \n  I selected an orange-colored box. The lid dissolved at the touch of my\nfingers.\n  \n \n  The only contents were small cubes of a soft orange substance.\n  \n \n  I tasted a small piece.\n  \n \n  \"Chocolate! Just like chocolate!\"\n  \n \n  Verana chose a nearby bottle and drank some of the bluish liquid.\n  \n \n  \"Milk!\" she exclaimed.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps we'd better look at the other rooms,\" I told her.\n  \n<doc-sep>When I awoke, my head was throbbing painfully.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and blinked several times to make sure they were\nfunctioning properly.

He returned to the living\nroom.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"I don't have much time. They know I escaped\nand they'll be looking for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Escaped?\" Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"The town has been taken over. They're in control.

It's\ngoing to be close\u2014but we may make it if we hurry. Come on!\" He grabbed\nher arm roughly. \"Get your coat and call the twins. We're all leaving.\nDon't stop to pack. There's no time for that.\"\n  \n \n  White-faced, his wife moved toward the closet and got down her coat.\n\"Where are we going?\"\n  \n \n  Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the\nfloor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. \"They'll have the\nhighway covered, of course. But there's a back road. To Oak Grove. I got\nonto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"The old Ranch Road? Good Lord\u2014it's completely closed. Nobody's\nsupposed to drive over it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.\" Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. \"That's our best\nchance. Now call down the twins and let's get going. Your car is full of\ngas, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Janet was dazed.\n  \n \n  \"The Chevy? I had it filled up yesterday afternoon.\" Janet moved toward\nthe stairs. \"Ed, I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Call the twins!\" Ed unlocked the front door and peered out. Nothing\nstirred. No sign of life. All right so far.\n  \n \n  \"Come on downstairs,\" Janet called in a wavering voice. \"We're\u2014going\nout for awhile.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now?\" Tommy's voice came.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry up,\" Ed barked. \"Get down here, both of you.\"\n  \n \n  Tommy appeared at the top of the stairs. \"I was doing my home work.\nWe're starting fractions. Miss Parker says if we don't get this done\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You can forget about fractions.\" Ed grabbed his son as he came down the\nstairs and propelled him toward the door. \"Where's Jim?\"\n  \n \n  \"He's coming.\"\n  \n \n  Jim started slowly down the stairs. \"What's up, Dad?\"\n  \n \n  \"We're going for a ride.\"\n  \n \n  \"A ride? Where?\"\n  \n \n  Ed turned to Janet. \"We'll leave the lights on. And the TV set. Go turn\nit on.\" He pushed her toward the set. \"So they'll think we're still\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out.\nSickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of\nmotion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy.\nIt was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse\u2014the thing hurtling at him,\ncold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow\nT-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange\nhalf-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?\n  \n \n  A stinger.\n  \n \n  Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce\nrolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as\nstatues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again.\nThis time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It\nbounced against the wall and fluttered down.\n  \n \n  Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien\nmind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his\nown, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utterly alien presence,\nsettling over him\u2014and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a\nbroken heap on the rug.\n  \n \n  It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of\nsome kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy.... He closed his mind\ntight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his\nknife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still,\nneither of them moving.\n  \n \n  The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It\nwas ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and\nopen fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone.\n  \n \n  Loyce opened the door. For a brief second he looked back at his wife and\nson. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps.\n  \n \n  A moment later he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness\ntoward the edge of town.\n  \n"

Only a tiredness. A relief. Relief from\na lifetime of beating around the planets. A life of digging, lifting,\nlugging and pounding. Like a work-worn Martian camel, he was going home\nto die.\n  \n \n  As though on oiled pistons the ship sank into the light, its long\nshark-like hull glowing soft and silvery, and settled with a feathery\nsnuggle into the cradle's ribs.\n  \n \n  The passenger line quivered as a loud-speaker boomed:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Stardust, now arrived at Cradle Six! Stardust, Cradle Six! All\npassengers for Venus and Earth prepare to board in ten minutes.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and wiped phlegm from his thin lips, his hand following\naround the bony contours of his face, feeling the hollows and the beard\nstubble and loose skin of his neck. He coughed and thought of the\nvanium mines of Pluto, and his gum-clogged lungs. A vague, pressing\ndesire for home overwhelmed him. It had been so long.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Attention! Attention, Stardust passengers! The signal is red. The\nsignal is red. Refunds now being made. Refunds now. Take-off in five\nminutes.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. \"Red,\" he groaned. \"By the\ninfinite galaxies, this is the last straw!\" He charged away, knocking\nShano aside as he passed.\n  \n \n \n   Red signal.\n   \n  In bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his\neyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out\nthere. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own\nrisk.\n  \n \n  He felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously.\n  \n \n  A hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest.\nPlucking at an urgency there.\n  \n \n  Dropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line\nhad dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Flight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus\n   \n  ,\" the loud-speaker said\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\n  \n \n  He clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\n\"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\"\nhe said. \"Want to go home. I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint\nmemories within his glazed mind.\n  \n \n  The lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\"\n  \n \n  The loud-speaker blared. \"\n   \n   Stardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The\nsignal is red. Stardust, taking\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  With the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock.\nThe officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was\nshut off.\n  \n \n  Lifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n  \n \n  \"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\n  \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog. You\n   \n   were\n   \n  looking for him, weren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who is he?\"\n  \n \n  She sat on the chair beside him.\n  \n \n  \"My husband,\" she said softly.\n  \n \n  He began to understand. \"And your husband needs an astrogator? That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me. When his\nship returns, I'll be going to him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why aren't you with him now?\"\n  \n \n  \"He said unexplored space is no place for a woman. So I've been\nstudying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of\nInvestigation and trying to find recruits like yourself. You know how\nwe operate?\"\n  \n \n  He told her the tales he'd heard.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper's\nlaboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\na halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\nmechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\nHe mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\nin the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\nfar enough to admit him.\n  \n \n  Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\non her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\nblonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n  \n \n  \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\nThen she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned. \"Why, no\u2014Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\nhours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\"\n  \n \n  She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete,\nyou know I haven't one\u2014it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether\nthere's trouble or not. What\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n  \n \n  She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\nwalked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\npapers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\nand pressed the stud.\n  \n \n  A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\nsuddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n  \n \n  Lorelei caught her breath.\n  \n \n  It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\nthe warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\ntransport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\nbeen dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\nyes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\ndisappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\nheartbeat they were gone.\n  \n \n  There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\ndefiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\nflesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\nmen and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\njoined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\nhelpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\nhorrible than any cry of agony.\n  \n \n  \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\nstrangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\nstreets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\n  \n"

        "Captain Menthlo, a silver-mustached Jupiterian, broad, huge, yet\ncrushable as a beetle, talked while his hands manipulated a panel of\nstuds in the control room. The pilot, his back encased in leather, sat\nin a bucket seat before him, listening into earphones.\n  \n \n  \"Surprised to learn of a passenger aboard,\" the captain said, glancing\nbriefly sideways. \"You're entitled to know of the danger ahead.\" He\nflicked a final stud, spoke to the pilot and at last turned a serious,\nsquared face to Shano. \"Old man,\" he said. \"There's a Uranian fleet out\nthere. We don't know how many ships in this sector. Flight twenty-one,\nwhich just landed, had a skirmish with one, and got away. We may not be\nso lucky. You know how these Uranian devils are.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and wiped his mouth. \"Dirty devils,\" he said. \"I was\ndriv' off the planet once, before this war started. I know things\nabout them Uranian devils. Heard them in the mines around. Hears\nthings, a laborer does.\"\n  \n \n  The captain seemed for the first time to realize the social status of\nhis lone passenger, and he became a little gruff.\n  \n \n  \"Want you to sign this waiver, saying you're traveling at your own\nrisk. We'll expect you to keep to your cabin as much as possible.\nWhen the trouble comes we can't bother with a passenger. In a few\nhours we'll shut down the ship entirely, and every mechanical device\naboard, to try to avoid detection.\" His mustaches rose like two spears\nfrom each side of his squared nose as his face changed to an alert\nwatchfulness. \"Going home, eh?\" he said. \"You've knocked around some,\nby the looks of you. Pluto, from the sound of that cough.\"\n  \n \n  Shano scrawled his signature on the waiver. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Pluto.\nWhere a man's lungs fights gas.\" He blinked watery eyes. \"Captain,\nwhat's a notched jaw mean to you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, old man,\" the captain grasped Shano's shoulder and turned him\naround. \"It means somebody cut himself, shaving. You stick tight to\nyour cabin.\" He nodded curtly and indicated the door.\n  \n \n  Descending the companionway to the next deck Shano observed the\nnick-jawed lieutenant staring out the viewport, apparently idling. The\nman turned and gripped Shano's thin arm.\n  \n \n  \"A light?\" he said, tapping a cigarette. Shano produced a lighter\ndisk and the chunky man puffed. He was an Earthman and his jaw seemed\ncut with a knife, notched like a piece of wood. Across the breast of\nhis tunic was a purple band, with the name\n   \n   Rourke\n   \n  . \"Why are you so\nanxious to get aboard, old man?\" He searched Shano's face. \"There's\ntrouble ahead, you know.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, wracking his body, as forgotten memories stirred\nsluggishly in his mind. \"Yup,\" he said, and jerked free and stumbled\ndown the steel deck.\n  \n \n  In his cabin he lay on the bunk, lighted a cigarette and smoked,\ncoughing and staring at the rivet-studded bulkhead. The slow movement\nof his mind resolved into a struggle, one idea groping for the other.\n  \n \n  What were the things he'd heard about nicked jaws? And where had\nhe heard them? Digging ore on Pluto; talk in the pits? Secretive\nsuspicions voiced in smoke-laden saloons of Mars? In the labor gangs of\nUranus? Where? Shano smoked and didn't know. But he knew there was a\nrumor, and that it was the talk of ignorant men. The captain had evaded\nit. Shano smoked and coughed and stared at the steel bulkhead and\nwaited.\n  \n<doc-sep>  SIGNAL RED\n  \n \n  By HENRY GUTH\n  \n \n  They tried to stop him.

Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\n  \n<doc-sep>The ship coasted. Shano could sense it coasting. He couldn't feel it\nor hear it, but he knew it was sliding ghost-like through space like a\nsubmarine dead under water, slipping quietly past a listening enemy.\n  \n \n  The ship's speaker rasped softly. \"\n   \n   Emergency. Battle posts.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The captain's voice. Calm, brief. It sent a tremor through Shano's\nbody. He heard a quick scuffle of feet again, running feet, directly\noverhead, and the captain's voice, more urgently, \"Power on. They've\nheard us.\"\n  \n \n  The words carried no accusation, but Shano realized what they meant.\nA slip-up. Something left running. Vibrations picked up quickly by\ndetectors of the Uranian space fleet.\n  \n \n  Shano coughed and heard the ship come to life around him. He pulled\nhimself out of the spasm, cursing Pluto. Cursing his diseased,\ngum-clogged lungs. Cursing the Uranian fleet that was trying to prevent\nhis going home\u2014even to die.\n  \n \n  This was a strange battle. Strange indeed. It was mostly silence.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, as though from another world, came a brief, curt order.\n\"Port guns alert.\" Then hush and tension.\n  \n \n  The deck lurched and the ship swung this way and that. Maybe dodging,\nmaybe maneuvering\u2014Shano didn't know. He felt the deck lurch, that was\nall.\n  \n \n  \"Fire number seven.\"\n  \n \n  He heard the weird scream of a ray gun, and felt the constricting\nterror that seemed to belt the ship like an iron band.\n  \n \n  This was a battle in space, and out there were Uranian cruisers trying\nto blast the\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  out of the sky. Trying and trying, while the\ncaptain dodged and fired back\u2014pitted his skill and knowledge against\nan enemy Shano couldn't see.\n  \n \n  He wanted desperately to help the captain break through, and get to\nEarth. But he could only cling to the plastic pipes and cough.\n  \n \n  The ship jounced and slid beneath his feet, and was filled with sound.\nIt rocked and rolled. Shano caromed off the bulkhead.\n  \n \n  \"Hold fire.\"\n  \n \n  He crawled to his knees on the slippery deck, grabbed the pipes and\npulled himself erect, hand over hand. His eyes came level with the gray\nmetal box behind the pipes. He squinted, fascinated, at the quivering\ndial needle. \"Hey!\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Stand by.\"\n  \n \n  Shano puzzled it out, his mind groping. He wasn't used to thinking.\nOnly working with his hands.\n  \n \n  This box. This needle that had quivered when the ship was closed\ndown....\n  \n \n  \"It's over. Chased them off. Ready guns before laying to. Third watch\non duty.\"\n  \n \n  Shano sighed at the sudden release of tension throughout the space\nliner\n   \n   Stardust\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Smoke spewed from his nostrils. His forehead wrinkled with\nconcentration. Those rumors: \"Man sells out to Uranus, gets a nick cut\nin his jaw. Ever see a man with a nick in his jaw? Watch him, he's up\nto something.\" The talk of ignorant men. Shano remembered.\n  \n \n  He poked behind the pipes and angrily slapped the toggle switches on\nthe box. The captain would only scoff. He'd never believe there was a\ntraitor aboard who had planted an electronic signal box, giving away\nthe ship's position. He'd never believe the babblings of an old man.\n  \n \n  He straightened up, glaring angrily. He knew. And the knowledge made\nhim cold and furious. He watched the engine room emergency exit as it\nopened cautiously.\n  \n \n  A chunky man backed out, holstering a flat blaster. He turned and saw\nShano, standing smoking. He walked over and nudged Shano, his face\ndark. Shano blew smoke into the dark face.\n  \n \n  \"Old man,\" said Rourke. \"What're you doing down here?\"\n  \n \n  Shano blinked.\n  \n \n  Rourke fingered the nick in his jaw, eyes glinting. \"You're supposed to\nbe in your cabin,\" he said. \"Didn't I warn you we'd run into trouble?\"\n  \n \n  Shano smoked and contemplated the chunky man. Estimated his strength\nand youth and felt the anger and frustration mount in him. \"Devil,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n \n \n   \"Devil,\" he said and dug his cigarette into the other's face.\n   \n \n \n \n  He lunged then, clawing. He dug the cigarette into Rourke's flushed\nface, and clung to his body. Rourke howled. He fell backward to the\ndeck, slapping at his blistered face. He thrashed around and Shano\nclung to him, battered, pressing the cigarette relentlessly, coughing,\ncursing the pain in his joints.\n  \n \n  Shano grasped Rourke's neck with his hands. He twisted the neck with\nhis gnarled hands. Strong hands that had worked.\n  \n \n  He got up when Rourke stopped thrashing. The face was purple and he\nwas dead. Shano shivered. He crouched in the passageway shivering and\ncoughing.\n  \n"

I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint\nmemories within his glazed mind.\n  \n \n  The lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\"\n  \n \n  The loud-speaker blared. \"\n   \n   Stardust, taking off in thirty seconds.

The outside was\nshut off.\n  \n \n  Lifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n  \n \n  \"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\n  \n<doc-sep>The ship's alarm clanged. Shano jerked from his bunk like a broken\nwatch spring. He crouched, trembling, on arthritic joints, as a\nloud-speaker blared throughout the ship.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   All hands! We now maintain dead silence. Close down and stop all\nmachinery. Power off and lights out. An enemy fleet is out there,\nlistening and watching for mechanical and electronic disturbance.\nAtmosphere will be maintained from emergency oxygen cylinders. Stop\npumps.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Shano crouched and listened as the ship's steady drone ceased and the\nvibrations ceased. The pumps stopped, the lights went out.\n  \n \n  Pressing the cold steel bulkhead, Shano heard oxygen hiss through the\npipes. Hiss and hiss and then flow soundlessly, filling the cabin and\nhis lungs. He choked.\n  \n \n  The cabin was like a mine shaft, dark and cold. Feet pounded on the\ndeck outside.\n  \n \n  Shano clawed open the door. He peered out anxiously.\n  \n \n  Cold blobs of light, phosphorescent bulbs held in the fists of men,\nglimmered by. Phosphorescent bulbs, because the power was off. Shano\nblinked. He saw officers and men, their faces tight and pinched,\nhurrying in all directions. Hurrying to shut down the ship.\n  \n \n  He acted impulsively. A young ensign strode by, drawn blaster in hand.\nShano followed him; followed the bluish glow of his bulb, through\nlabyrinthine passages and down a companionway, coughing and leering\nagainst the pain in his joints. The blue light winked out in the\ndistance and Shano stopped.\n  \n \n  He was suddenly alarmed. The captain had warned him to stay in his\ncabin. He looked back and forth, wondering how to return.\n  \n \n  A bell clanged.\n  \n \n  Shano saw a cold bulb glowing down the passageway, and he shuffled\nhopefully toward it. The bulb moved away. He saw an indistinct figure\ndisappear through a door marked, ENGINE ROOM.\n  \n \n  Shano paused uncertainly at the end of the passageway. A thick cluster\nof vertical pipes filled the corner. He peered at the pipes and saw a\ngray box snuggled behind them. It had two toggle switches and a radium\ndial that quivered delicately.\n  \n \n  Shano scratched his scalp as boots pounded on the decks, above\nand below. He listened attentively to the ship's familiar noises\ndiminishing one by one. And finally even the pounding of feet died out;\neverything became still. The silence shrieked in his ears.\n  \n<doc-sep>Obediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive\nin an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful\nout of her element, though.\n  \n \n  The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal\nretraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow,\nphysically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with\nit. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A\nscientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got\nclose. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed.\nAnticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans.\nThat makes the knife definite.\"\n  \n \n  Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal\nstopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.\n  \n \n  \"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything\non this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted\nintersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"\n  \n \n  The lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said\nCassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on\ngetting back to the hotel?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm curious. Turn here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that\nintersection, he turned there.\n  \n \n  It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily\nslow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on\nthe other.\n  \n \n  He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all\nvery well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was\nalso the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an\nelectronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.\n  \n \n  \"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking\nfast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased.\nNot just now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism\nconcealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued:\n\"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like\nthis, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is\ncritical.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand.\nHe clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness\nassumed an even more sinister quality.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask\nme for a light.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't think so,\" answered Dimanche. \"He's whispering: 'Poor devil. I\nhate to do it. But it's really his life or mine'.\"\n  \n \n  \"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't\nthere any clue?\"\n  \n \n  \"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn\naround.\"\n  \n"

Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first Don Alford had some trouble locating the POSAT headquarters.\nIt seemed to him that the block in which the street number would fall\nwas occupied entirely by a huge sprawling warehouse, of concrete\nconstruction, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the\nstreet in several places to make room for the small, shabby buildings\nof a wholesale pharmacy, a printer's plant, an upholstering shop, and\nwas also indented by alleys lined with loading platforms.\n  \n \n  It was at the back of one of the alleys that he finally found a door\nmarked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT.\n  \n \n  He opened the frosted glass door with a feeling of misgiving, and faced\na dark flight of stairs leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him\na buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way\nup through the murky stairwell.\n  \n \n  The reception room was hardly a cheerful place, with its battered desk\nfacing the view of the empty alley, and a film of dust obscuring the\npattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But the light of\nthe summer afternoon filtering through the window scattered the gloom\nsomewhat, enough to help Don doubt that he would find the menace here\nthat he had come to expect.\n  \n \n  The girl addressing envelopes at the desk looked very ordinary.\n   \n   Not\nthe Mata-Hari type\n   \n  , thought Don, with an inward chuckle at his own\nsuspicions. He handed her the letter.\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"We've been expecting you, Dr. Alford. If you'll just step\ninto the next room\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She opened a door opposite the stairwell, and Don stepped through it.\n  \n \n  The sight of the luxurious room before him struck his eyes with the\nshock of a dentist's drill, so great was the contrast between it and\nthe shabby reception room. For a moment Don had difficulty breathing.\nThe rug\u2014Don had seen one like it before, but it had been in a museum.\nThe paintings on the walls, ornately framed in gilt carving, were\nsurely old masters\u2014of the Renaissance period, he guessed. Although he\nrecognized none of the pictures, he felt that he could almost name the\nartists. That glowing one near the corner would probably be a Titian.\nOr was it Tintorretto? He regretted for a moment the lost opportunities\nof his college days, when he had passed up Art History in favor of\nOperational Circuit Analysis.\n  \n \n  The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set flush with\nthe wall, and, selecting a folder from it, disappeared through another\ndoor.\n  \n \n  Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung at eye\nlevel\u2014that is, at the eye level of the average person. Don had to bend\nover a bit to see it properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently\nthere was none. But did artists sign their pictures back in those\ndays? He wished he knew more about such things.\n  \n \n  Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube\nheld on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened up from his\nscrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head against the\nlight. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to the rug with a\nmuffled thud.\n  \n \n \n   Now I've done it!\n   \n  thought Don with dismay. But at least the tube\nhadn't shattered.\n  \n \n  In fact\u2014it was still glowing brightly! His eyes registered the fact,\neven while his mind refused to believe it. He raised his eyes to the\nbrackets. They were simple pieces of solid hardware designed to support\nthe tube.\n  \n \n  There were no wires!\n  \n \n  Don picked up the slender, glowing cylinder and held it between\ntrembling fingers. Although it was delivering as much light as a two\nor three hundred watt bulb, it was cool to the touch. He examined it\nminutely. There was no possibility of concealed batteries.\n  \n \n  The thumping of his heart was caused not by the fact that he had never\nseen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had never held\none in his hands, though. The ones which his company had produced as\nexperimental models had been unsuccessful at converting all of the\nradioactivity into light, and had, of necessity, been heavily shielded.\n  \n \n  Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory would still\nbe searching for the right combination of fluorescent material\nand radioactive salts with which to make the simple, efficient,\nself-contained lighting unit that he was holding in his hand at this\nmoment!\n  \n \n \n   But this is impossible!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   We're the only company that's\nworking on this, and it's secret. There can't be any in actual\nproduction!\n   \n \n \n  And even if one had actually been successfully produced, how would it\nhave fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient Secret Society,\nThe Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth?\n  \n \n  The conviction grew in Don's mind that here was something much deeper\nand more sinister than he would be able to cope with. He should have\nasked for help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the\nF.B.I. Even now\u2014\n  \n \n  With sudden decision, he thrust the lighting tube into his pocket and\nstepped swiftly to the outer door. He grasped the knob and shook it\nimpatiently when it stuck and refused to turn. He yanked at it. His\nimpatience changed to panic. It was locked!\n  \n \n  A soft sound behind him made him whirl about. The secretary had\nentered again through the inner door. She glanced at the vacant light\nbracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. Her gaze was still\nas bland and innocent as when he had entered, but to Don she no longer\nseemed ordinary. Her very calmness in the face of his odd actions was\ndistressingly ominous.\n  \n \n  \"Our Grand Chairman will see you now,\" she said in a quiet voice.\n  \n \n  Don realized that he was half crouched in the position of an animal\nexpecting attack. He straightened up with what dignity he could manage\nto find.\n  \n \n  She opened the inner door again and Don followed her into what he\nsupposed to be the office of the Grand Chairman of POSAT.\n  \n \n  Instead he found himself on a balcony along the side of a vast room,\nwhich must have been the interior of the warehouse that he had noted\noutside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of the balcony, where\na frosted glass door marked the office of the Grand Chairman.\n  \n \n \n \n  But Don could not will his legs to move. His heart beat at the sight of\nthe room below him. It was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of\nwhich he had never seen before. Most of the equipment was unfamiliar\nto him. Whatever he did recognize was of a different design than he had\never used, and there was something about it that convinced him that\nthis was more advanced. The men who bent busily over their instruments\ndid not raise their eyes to the figures on the balcony.\n  \n \n  \"Good Lord!\" Don gasped. \"That's an atomic reactor down there!\" There\ncould be no doubt about it, even though he could see it only obscurely\nthrough the bluish-green plastic shielding it.\n  \n \n  His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that he had\nspoken aloud, or that the door at the end of the balcony had opened.\n  \n \n  He was only dimly aware of the approaching footsteps as he speculated\nwildly on the nature of the shielding material. What could be so dense\nthat only an inch would provide adequate shielding and yet remain\nsemitransparent?\n  \n \n  His scientist's mind applauded the genius who had developed it, even as\nthe alarming conviction grew that he wouldn't\u2014couldn't\u2014be allowed to\nleave here any more. Surely no man would be allowed to leave this place\nalive to tell the fantastic story to the world!\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Don,\" said a quiet voice beside him. \"It's good to see you\nagain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dr. Crandon!\" he heard his own voice reply. \"\n   \n   You're\n   \n  the Grand\nChairman of POSAT?\"\n  \n \n  He felt betrayed and sick at heart. The very voice with which\nCrandon had spoken conjured up visions of quiet lecture halls and\nhis own youthful excitement at the masterful and orderly disclosure\nof scientific facts. To find him here in this mad and treacherous\nplace\u2014didn't anything make sense any longer?\n  \n \n  \"I think we have rather abused you, Don,\" Dr. Crandon continued. His\nvoice sounded so gentle that Don found it hard to think there was any\nevil in it. \"I can see that you are suspicious of us, and\u2014yes\u2014afraid.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Hesitantly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a\npoint\u2014but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat.\nBlote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. \"Kindly direct\nme, Dan,\" Blote demanded. \"Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know the town very well,\" Dan said, \"but Maple's over that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky.\nFaint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan\nlooked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.\n  \n \n  \"Over there,\" he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped\nsmoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.\n  \n \n  \"Better let me take over now,\" Dan suggested. \"I want to be sure to\nget us to the right place.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well, Dan.\"\n  \n \n  Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly\nseen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage\ngrew even fainter. \"Best we remain unnoticed,\" he explained.\n  \n \n  The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying\nlandmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely\nvisible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers\nalong both sides of the passage at once.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines\nemploy a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where\nthey do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered\nleft, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous\nfigures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed\nwrong\u2014\n  \n \n  The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus.\nBlote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete\nwalls, the barred door and\u2014\n  \n \n  \"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed.\n  \n \n  \"Grab him!\" someone yelled.\n  \n \n  Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt\nto regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a\nlever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures\nas the carrier shot away through the cell wall.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the\nclear, he would have to decide on his next move\u2014fast. There was no\ntelling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide\nthe carrier, then\u2014\n  \n \n  A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume.\nDan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.\n  \n \n  The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of\nmechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous\nlandscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the\ndeafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once.\nIf the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked\nthe controls, dropping toward the distant earth.\n  \n \n  The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought\nthe carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few\ninches and cut the switch.\n  \n \n  As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.\n  \n \n  Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise\nwas, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians\nin the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why\nhadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no\nsound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a\nsecluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in,\nreached for the controls\u2014\n  \n \n  There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials\nbefore him frosted over. There was a loud\n   \n   pop!\n   \n  like a flashbulb\nexploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle\nwhich hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded\nto blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a\ntight-fitting white uniform stepped through.\n  \n \n  Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face,\nthe long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly\nred-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat\npillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set\nyellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in\na smile which showed square yellowish teeth.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Alors, monsieur\n   \n  ,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in\na quick bow. \"\n   \n   Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\"\n  \n \n  \"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me.\nPermit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Class\nfive, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"That siren,\" Dan said. \"Was that you?\"\n  \n \n  Dzhackoon nodded. \"For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined to\nstop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  \"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked.\n  \n \n  \"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n  \n \n  \"Inter-what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our\nlanguage coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you want with me?\"\n  \n"

        " \n \n  THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE\n  \n \n  Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a\nnightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets.\nAfter recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously\nat himself. \u201cHere I was picked as the\nmost stable of a group of two hundred cadets,\u201d he\nthought, \u201cand chosen to make man\u2019s first trip into\nspace, yet I\u2019m shaking like a leaf.\u201d\n  \n \n  He got out of bed and went over to the window.\nFrom his father\u2019s temporary apartment, he could\nsee distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into\nspace tomorrow night. He had been awarded the\nfrightening honor of making that trip.\n  \n 10\n  \n  As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,\nArizona\u2019s, double-decked streets, elevated over one\nanother to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying\nstop lights, he thought back over the years; to\nthe 1950\u2019s, when mice and monkeys were sent up\nin Vikings to launch mankind\u2019s first probing of the\nmysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites\nwere launched; to the 1960\u2019s, when huger,\nmultiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem\nof escape velocity; to 1975\u2014today\u2014when man\nwas finally ready to send one of his own kind into\nthe uninhabited deeps.\n  \n \n  Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would\nnot come.\n  \n \n  In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps\nof mother and father. By their sound he knew\nthey were the footsteps of worried people. This\nhurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.\n  \n \n  The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when\nhe had first signed up for space-cadet training. They\nhad known there was an extremely high percentage\nof washouts, and after each test he passed, they had\npretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly\nthey had hoped he would fail, for they were\naware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists\nwere working for\u2014the goal that had just now been\nreached.\n  \n \n  Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted\nuntil morning.\n  \n \n  He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got\nup, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,\nand tugged on the polished gray boots. He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n  \n 11\n  \n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n  \n \n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving.",
        " Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Spacemen Die at Home\n  \n \n  By EDWARD W.

And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing\nfear\u2014a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an\nevil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\n  \n \n  Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\n  \n \n  It was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,\nwere over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and\nlaboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after\nspawning its first-born.\n  \n \n  For it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class\nof the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   first\n   \n  graduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important,\nbecause we were the\n   \n   first\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  We sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach\nof faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New\nMexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and\ngrandparents and kid brothers and sisters\u2014the people who a short time\nago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken\nwistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had\nnever really existed.\n  \n \n  But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us\nwith pride in their eyes.\n  \n \n  A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked\nhard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.\nThey're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately\nneed. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land\nthat will bear food and be a home for our children.

It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\nquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\npower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\nswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n  \n \n  They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\nbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\nGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\nfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\npseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel\nnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n  \n \n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n  \n \n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n  \n \n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n  \n \n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\nwas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\nabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n  \n \n  They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\n  \n"

    [
        " \n \n  THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE\n  \n \n  Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a\nnightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets.\nAfter recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously\nat himself. \u201cHere I was picked as the\nmost stable of a group of two hundred cadets,\u201d he\nthought, \u201cand chosen to make man\u2019s first trip into\nspace, yet I\u2019m shaking like a leaf.\u201d\n  \n \n  He got out of bed and went over to the window.\nFrom his father\u2019s temporary apartment, he could\nsee distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into\nspace tomorrow night. He had been awarded the\nfrightening honor of making that trip.\n  \n 10\n  \n  As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,\nArizona\u2019s, double-decked streets, elevated over one\nanother to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying\nstop lights, he thought back over the years; to\nthe 1950\u2019s, when mice and monkeys were sent up\nin Vikings to launch mankind\u2019s first probing of the\nmysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites\nwere launched; to the 1960\u2019s, when huger,\nmultiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem\nof escape velocity; to 1975\u2014today\u2014when man\nwas finally ready to send one of his own kind into\nthe uninhabited deeps.\n  \n \n  Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would\nnot come.\n  \n \n  In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps\nof mother and father. By their sound he knew\nthey were the footsteps of worried people. This\nhurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.\n  \n \n  The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when\nhe had first signed up for space-cadet training. They\nhad known there was an extremely high percentage\nof washouts, and after each test he passed, they had\npretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly\nthey had hoped he would fail, for they were\naware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists\nwere working for\u2014the goal that had just now been\nreached.\n  \n \n  Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted\nuntil morning.\n  \n \n  He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got\nup, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,\nand tugged on the polished gray boots. He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n  \n 11\n  \n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n  \n \n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.",
        "\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon.\n  \n<doc-sep>He woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n  \n \n  He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n  \n \n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n  \n \n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n  \n \n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had\nonce known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years\nof solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind.\n  \n<doc-sep>He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next\u2014for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space\u2014all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once\u2014then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real\u2014to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears\u2014to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n"

        " \n \n  THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE\n  \n \n  Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a\nnightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets.\nAfter recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously\nat himself. \u201cHere I was picked as the\nmost stable of a group of two hundred cadets,\u201d he\nthought, \u201cand chosen to make man\u2019s first trip into\nspace, yet I\u2019m shaking like a leaf.\u201d\n  \n \n  He got out of bed and went over to the window.\nFrom his father\u2019s temporary apartment, he could\nsee distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into\nspace tomorrow night. He had been awarded the\nfrightening honor of making that trip.\n  \n 10\n  \n  As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,\nArizona\u2019s, double-decked streets, elevated over one\nanother to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying\nstop lights, he thought back over the years; to\nthe 1950\u2019s, when mice and monkeys were sent up\nin Vikings to launch mankind\u2019s first probing of the\nmysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites\nwere launched; to the 1960\u2019s, when huger,\nmultiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem\nof escape velocity; to 1975\u2014today\u2014when man\nwas finally ready to send one of his own kind into\nthe uninhabited deeps.\n  \n \n  Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would\nnot come.\n  \n \n  In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps\nof mother and father. By their sound he knew\nthey were the footsteps of worried people. This\nhurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.\n  \n \n  The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when\nhe had first signed up for space-cadet training. They\nhad known there was an extremely high percentage\nof washouts, and after each test he passed, they had\npretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly\nthey had hoped he would fail, for they were\naware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists\nwere working for\u2014the goal that had just now been\nreached.\n  \n \n  Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted\nuntil morning.\n  \n \n  He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got\nup, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,\nand tugged on the polished gray boots. He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n  \n 11\n  \n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n  \n \n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.",
        "\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Spacemen Die at Home\n  \n \n  By EDWARD W.

They were the faces of mothers and fathers and\ngrandparents and kid brothers and sisters\u2014the people who a short time\nago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken\nwistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had\nnever really existed.\n  \n \n  But today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us\nwith pride in their eyes.\n  \n \n  A voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \"... these boys have worked\nhard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.\nThey're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately\nneed.

        " \n \n  THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE\n  \n \n  Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a\nnightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets.\nAfter recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously\nat himself. \u201cHere I was picked as the\nmost stable of a group of two hundred cadets,\u201d he\nthought, \u201cand chosen to make man\u2019s first trip into\nspace, yet I\u2019m shaking like a leaf.\u201d\n  \n \n  He got out of bed and went over to the window.\nFrom his father\u2019s temporary apartment, he could\nsee distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into\nspace tomorrow night. He had been awarded the\nfrightening honor of making that trip.\n  \n 10\n  \n  As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,\nArizona\u2019s, double-decked streets, elevated over one\nanother to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying\nstop lights, he thought back over the years; to\nthe 1950\u2019s, when mice and monkeys were sent up\nin Vikings to launch mankind\u2019s first probing of the\nmysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites\nwere launched; to the 1960\u2019s, when huger,\nmultiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem\nof escape velocity; to 1975\u2014today\u2014when man\nwas finally ready to send one of his own kind into\nthe uninhabited deeps.\n  \n \n  Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would\nnot come.\n  \n \n  In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps\nof mother and father. By their sound he knew\nthey were the footsteps of worried people. This\nhurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.\n  \n \n  The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when\nhe had first signed up for space-cadet training. They\nhad known there was an extremely high percentage\nof washouts, and after each test he passed, they had\npretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly\nthey had hoped he would fail, for they were\naware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists\nwere working for\u2014the goal that had just now been\nreached.\n  \n \n  Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted\nuntil morning.\n  \n \n  He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got\nup, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,\nand tugged on the polished gray boots. He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n  \n 11\n  \n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n  \n \n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment. He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules.",
        " Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Spacemen Die at Home\n  \n \n  By EDWARD W.

KASTLE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by von Dongen\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n   The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be\nwelcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a\nhero...?\n   \n \n \n  There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual\nspeeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had\nonce been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had\nsince engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything\nwasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as\nat-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming\u2014for Corporal Berringer,\none of the crew of the spaceship\n   \n   Washington\n   \n  , first to set Americans\nupon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His\nHonor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.\n  \n \n  Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the\nhometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal\ntour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat\nbetween the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,\nand looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National\nGuard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of\nthe churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their\nparishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous\nnational interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them\ncome around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as\nthey'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these\u2014as the\nnewspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century\u2014the\nGalloping Twenties.\n  \n \n  He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man\nand he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than\nany man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a\nkiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old\nfriends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.\nHe wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps\nhe would talk.\n  \n \n  Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had\nreturned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great\nmariners, from Columbus onward\u2014long, dull periods of time passing,\npassing, and then the arrival.\n  \n \n  The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him\noff at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.\nThey had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,\nalmost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had\nwanted it to be as before.\n  \n \n  The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had\nescorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.\nHe was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with\nstrangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing\nbeside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,\ntheir eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was\nstill too much the First One to have his gaze met.\n  \n \n  He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate\nflagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental\nknocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was\nsurprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching\nat a window.\n  \n \n  And perhaps she\n   \n   had\n   \n  been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.\n  \n \n  The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she\nhadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved\nin high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.\nRalphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual\nsupport, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They\nlooked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,\n\"It's good to be home!\"\n  \n \n  Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other\narm around him. He kissed her\u2014her neck, her cheek\u2014and all the old\njokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the\nand-\n   \n   then\n   \n  -I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.\nShe was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the\ndifference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to\nRalphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could\nthink of nothing else to say, \"What a big fella, what a big fella.\"\n  \n \n  Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the\nfloor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. \"I\ndidn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.\"\n  \n \n  So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that\neverything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General\nCarlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left\nWashington.\n  \n \n  \"Give it some time,\" Carlisle had said. \"You need the time; they need\nthe time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.\"\n  \n"

Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the\nfirst!\n   \n \n<doc-sep> \n \n  THE FIRST MAN INTO SPACE\n  \n \n  Cadet Marshall Farnsworth woke from a\nnightmare of exploding novae and fouling rockets.\nAfter recovering from his fright, he laughed contemptuously\nat himself. \u201cHere I was picked as the\nmost stable of a group of two hundred cadets,\u201d he\nthought, \u201cand chosen to make man\u2019s first trip into\nspace, yet I\u2019m shaking like a leaf.\u201d\n  \n \n  He got out of bed and went over to the window.\nFrom his father\u2019s temporary apartment, he could\nsee distant Skyharbor, the scene of the plunge into\nspace tomorrow night. He had been awarded the\nfrightening honor of making that trip.\n  \n 10\n  \n  As he watched teardrop cars whip along Phoenix,\nArizona\u2019s, double-decked streets, elevated over one\nanother to avoid dangerous intersections and delaying\nstop lights, he thought back over the years; to\nthe 1950\u2019s, when mice and monkeys were sent up\nin Vikings to launch mankind\u2019s first probing of the\nmysterious space beyond Earth, and the first satellites\nwere launched; to the 1960\u2019s, when huger,\nmultiple-stage rockets finally conquered the problem\nof escape velocity; to 1975\u2014today\u2014when man\nwas finally ready to send one of his own kind into\nthe uninhabited deeps.\n  \n \n  Marsh climbed back into bed, but sleep would\nnot come.\n  \n \n  In the adjoining room, he could hear the footsteps\nof mother and father. By their sound he knew\nthey were the footsteps of worried people. This\nhurt Marsh more than his own uneasiness.\n  \n \n  The anxiety had begun for them, he knew, when\nhe had first signed up for space-cadet training. They\nhad known there was an extremely high percentage\nof washouts, and after each test he passed, they had\npretended to be glad. But Marsh knew that inwardly\nthey had hoped he would fail, for they were\naware of the ultimate goal that the space scientists\nwere working for\u2014the goal that had just now been\nreached.\n  \n \n  Marsh finally fell into a troubled sleep that lasted\nuntil morning.\n  \n \n  He woke early, before the alarm rang. He got\nup, showered, pulled on his blue-corded cadet uniform,\nand tugged on the polished gray boots. He\ntook one final look around his room as though in\nfarewell, then went out to the kitchen.\n  \n 11\n  \n  His folks were up ahead of time too, trying to\nact as though it were just another day. Dad was pretending\nto enjoy his morning paper, nodding only\ncasually to Marsh as he came in. Mom was stirring\nscrambled eggs in the skillet, but she wasn\u2019t a very\ngood actor, Marsh noticed, for she furtively wiped\nher eyes with her free hand.\n  \n \n  The eggs were cooked too hard and the toast had\nto be scraped, but no one seemed to care. The three\nof them sat down at the table, still speaking in\nmonosyllables and of unimportant things. They\nmade a pretense of eating.\n  \n \n  \u201cWell, Mom,\u201d Dad suddenly said with a forced\njollity that was intended to break the tension, \u201cthe\nFarnsworth family has finally got a celebrity in it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI don\u2019t see why they don\u2019t send an older man!\u201d\nMom burst out, as though she had been holding it\nin as long as she could. \u201cSending a boy who isn\u2019t\neven twenty-two\u2014\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cThings are different nowadays, Mom,\u201d Dad explained,\nstill with the assumed calmness that\nmasked his real feelings. \u201cThese days, men grow\nup faster and mature quicker. They\u2019re stronger and\nmore alert than older men\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off\nas if he were unable to convince himself.\n  \n \n  \u201c\n   \n   Some\n   \n  body has to go,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWhy not a\nyounger man without family and responsibility?\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re giving younger men more opportunities\ntoday than they used to.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s not younger men I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Mom\nblurted. \u201cIt\u2019s you, Marsh!\u201d\n  \n 12\n  \n  Dad leaned over and patted Mom on the shoulder.\n\u201cNow, Ruth, we promised not to get excited\nthis morning.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mom said weakly. \u201cBut Marsh is too\nyoung to\u2014\u201d She caught herself and put her hand\nover her mouth.\n  \n \n  \u201cStop talking like that!\u201d Dad said. \u201cMarsh is\ncoming back. There\u2019ve been thousands of rockets\nsent aloft. The space engineers have made sure that\nevery bug has been ironed out before risking a\nman\u2019s life. Why, that rocket which Marsh is going\nup in is as safe as our auto in the garage, isn\u2019t it,\nMarsh?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI hope so, Dad,\u201d Marsh murmured.\n  \n \n \n  Later, as Dad drove Marsh to the field, each\nbrooded silently. Every scene along the way seemed\nto take on a new look for Marsh. He saw things\nthat he had never noticed before. It was an uncomfortable\nfeeling, almost as if he were seeing these\nthings for the last as well as the first time.\n  \n \n  Finally the airport came into view. The guards\nat the gate recognized Marsh and ushered the\nFarnsworth car through ahead of scores of others\nthat crowded the entrance. Some eager news photographers\nslipped up close and shot off flash bulbs\nin Marsh\u2019s eyes.\n  \n \n  Skyharbor, once a small commercial field, had\nbeen taken over by the Air Force in recent years\nand converted into the largest rocket experimental\ncenter in the United States.\n  \n 13\n  \n  Dad drove up to the building that would be the\nscene of Marsh\u2019s first exhaustive tests and briefings.\nHe stopped the car, and Marsh jumped out. Their\ngood-by was brief. Marsh saw his father\u2019s mouth\nquiver. There was a tightness in his own throat. He\nhad gone through any number of grueling tests to\nprove that he could take the rigors of space, but\nnot one of them had prepared him for the hardest\nmoments of parting.\n  \n \n  When Dad had driven off, Marsh reported first\nto the psychiatrist who checked his condition.\n  \n \n  \u201cPulse fast, a rise in blood pressure,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh admitted. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve got\nthe wrong man, sir. I might fail them.\u201d\n  \n \n  The doctor grinned. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the wrong\nman,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might have, with a so-called\niron-nerved fellow. He could contain his tension\nand fears until later, until maybe the moment of\nblast-off. Then he\u2019d let go, and when he needed his\ncalmest judgment he wouldn\u2019t have it. No, Marshall,\nthere isn\u2019t a man alive who could make this\nhistory-making flight without some anxiety. Forget\nit. You\u2019ll feel better as the day goes on. I\u2019ll see you\nonce more before the blast-off.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh felt more at ease already. He went on to\nthe space surgeon, was given a complete physical\nexamination, and was pronounced in perfect condition.\nThen began his review briefing on everything\nhe would encounter during the flight.\n  \n 14\n  \n  Blast-off time was for 2230, an hour and a half\nbefore midnight. Since at night, in the Western\nHemisphere, Earth was masking the sun, the complications\nof excessive temperatures in the outer\nreaches were avoided during the time Marsh would\nbe outside the ship. Marsh would occupy the small\nupper third section of a three-stage rocket. The first\ntwo parts would be jettisoned after reaching their\npeak velocities. Top speed of the third stage would\ncarry Marsh into a perpetual-flight orbit around\nEarth, along the route that a permanent space station\nwas to be built after the results of the flight\nwere studied. After spending a little while in this\norbit, Marsh would begin the precarious journey\nback to Earth, in gliding flight.\n  \n \n  He got a few hours of sleep after sunset. When\nan officer shook him, he rose from the cot he had\nbeen lying on in a private room of General Forsythe,\nChief of Space Operations.\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s almost time, son,\u201d the officer said. \u201cYour\nCO wants to see you in the outside office.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh went into the adjoining room and found\nhis cadet chief awaiting him. The youth detected an\nunusual warmth about the severe gentleman who\npreviously had shown only a firm, uncompromising\nattitude. Colonel Tregasker was past middle age,\nand his white, sparse hair was smoothed down close\nto his head in regulation neatness.\n  \n 15\n  \n  \u201cWell, this is it, Marshall,\u201d the colonel said.\n\u201cHow I envy you this honor of being the first human\nto enter space. However, I do feel that a part\nof me is going along too, since I had a small share\nin preparing you for the trip. If the training was\nharsh at times, I believe that shortly you will\nunderstand the reason for it.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that the Colonel was either too soft\nor strict, sir,\u201d Marsh said diplomatically.\n  \n \n  A speaker out on the brilliantly lit field blared\nloudly in the cool desert night: \u201cX minus forty\nminutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cWe can\u2019t talk all night, Marshall,\u201d the colonel\nsaid briskly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a job to do. But first, a few\nof your friends want to wish you luck.\u201d He called\ninto the anteroom, \u201cYou may come in, gentlemen!\u201d\n  \n \n  There filed smartly into the room ten youths who\nhad survived the hard prespace course with Marsh\nand would be his successors in case he failed tonight.\nThey formed a line and shook hands with\nMarsh. The first was Armen Norton who had gotten\nsick in the rugged centrifuge at a force of 9 G\u2019s,\nthen had rallied to pass the test.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, Marsh,\u201d he said.\n  \n \n  Next was lanky Lawrence Egan who had been\ncertain he would wash out during navigation phase\nin the planetarium. \u201cAll the luck in the world,\nMarsh,\u201d he added.\n  \n \n  Each cadet brought back a special memory of his\ntraining as they passed before him, wishing him\nsuccess.\n  \n 16\n  \n  When they had gone and the speaker outside\nhad announced: \u201cX minus thirty minutes,\u201d the\ncolonel said that he and Marsh had better be leaving.\nColonel Tregasker was to be Marsh\u2019s escort to\nthe ship.\n  \n \n  Photographers and newspapermen swarmed\nabout them as they climbed into the jeep that was\nto take them to the launching site farther out on\nthe field. Questions were flung at the two from all\nsides, but the colonel deftly maneuvered the jeep\nthrough the mob and sped off over the asphalt.\n  \n \n  At the blast-off site, Marsh could see that the\npolice had their hands full keeping out thousands\nof spectators who were trying to get into the closed-off\narea. The field was choked with a tide of humanity\nmilling about in wild confusion. Giant searchlights,\nboth at the airport and in other parts of\nPhoenix, directed spears of light on the towering\nrocket that held the interest of all the world tonight.\nThere was one light, far larger than the rest,\nwith powerful condensing lenses and connected to\na giant radar screen, which would guide Marsh\nhome from his trip among the stars.\n  \n \n  A high wire fence surrounded the launching\nramp and blockhouses. International scientists and\ndignitaries with priorities formed a ring around\nthe fence, but even they were not allowed inside\nthe small circle of important activity. The guards\nwaved the colonel and Marsh through the gate.\n  \n 17\n  \n  Marsh had spent many weeks in a mock-up of the\ntiny third stage in which he was to spend his time\naloft, but he had never been close to the completely\nassembled ship until this moment. The three stages\nhad been nicknamed, \u201cTom,\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d and \u201cHarry.\u201d\nMarsh swallowed as his eyes roved up the side of\nthe great vessel, part of a project that had cost millions\nto perfect and was as high as a four-story\nbuilding.\n  \n \n  The gigantic base, \u201cBig Tom,\u201d was the section\nthat would have the hardest job to do, that of\nthrusting the rocket through the densest part of the\natmosphere, and this was a great deal larger than\nthe other sections. Marsh knew that most of the\nship\u2019s bulk was made up of the propellant fuel of\nhydrazine hydrate and its oxidizer, nitric acid.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re going into that blockhouse over there,\u201d\nColonel Tregasker said. \u201cYou\u2019ll don your space gear\nin there.\u201d\n  \n \n  First a multitude of gadgets with wires were fastened\nto the cadet\u2019s wrists, ankles, nose, and head.\nMarsh knew this to be one of the most important\nphases of the flight\u2014to find out a man\u2019s reaction to\nspace flight under actual rocketing conditions. Each\nwire would telemeter certain information by radio\nback to the airport. After a tight inner G suit had\nbeen put on to prevent blackout, the plastic and\nrubber outer garment was zipped up around Marsh,\nand then he was ready except for his helmet, which\nwould not be donned until later.\n  \n 18\n  \n  Marsh and the colonel went back outside. The\nopen-cage elevator was lowered from the top of the\nbig latticed platform that surrounded the rocket.\nThe two got into the cage, and it rose with them.\nMarsh had lost most of his anxiety and tension\nduring the activities of the day, but his knees felt\nrubbery in these final moments as the elevator carried\nhim high above the noisy confusion of the airport.\n   \n   This was it.\n   \n \n \n  As they stepped from the cage onto the platform\nof the third stage, Marsh heard the speaker below\ncall out: \u201cX minus twenty minutes.\u201d\n  \n \n  There were eleven engineers and workmen on\nthe platform readying the compartment that Marsh\nwould occupy. Marsh suddenly felt helpless and\nalone as he faced the small chamber that might\nvery well be his death cell. Its intricate dials and\nwires were staggering in their complexity.\n  \n \n  Marsh turned and shook hands with Colonel Tregasker.\n\u201cGood-by, sir,\u201d he said in a quavering voice.\n\u201cI hope I remember everything the Corps taught\nme.\u201d He tried to smile, but his facial muscles\ntwitched uncontrollably.\n  \n \n  \u201cGood luck, son\u2014lots of it,\u201d the officer said\nhuskily. Suddenly he leaned forward and embraced\nthe youth with a firm, fatherly hug. \u201cThis is not\nregulations,\u201d he mumbled gruffly, \u201cbut hang regulations!\u201d\nHe turned quickly and asked to be carried\ndown to the ground.\n  \n \n  A man brought Marsh\u2019s helmet and placed it\nover his head, then clamped it to the suit. Knobs\non the suit were twisted, and Marsh felt a warm,\npressurized helium-oxygen mixture fill his suit and\nheadpiece.\n  \n 19\n  \n  Marsh stepped through the hatch into the small\ncompartment. He reclined in the soft contour\nchair, and the straps were fastened by one of the\nengineers over his chest, waist, and legs. The wires\nconnected to various parts of his body had been\nbrought together into a single unit in the helmet.\nA wire cable leading from the panel was plugged\ninto the outside of the helmet to complete the circuit.\n  \n \n  Final tests were run off to make sure everything\nwas in proper working order, including the two-way\nshort-wave radio that would have to penetrate the\nelectrical ocean of the ionosphere. Then the double-hatch\nair lock was closed. Through his helmet receiver,\nMarsh could hear the final minutes and seconds\nbeing called off from inside the blockhouse.\n  \n \n  \u201cEverything O.K.?\u201d Marsh was asked by someone\non the platform.\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied.\n  \n \n  \u201cThen you\u2019re on your own,\u201d were the final ominous\nwords.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus five minutes,\u201d called the speaker.\n  \n 20\n  \n  It was the longest five minutes that Marsh could\nremember. He was painfully aware of his cramped\nquarters. He thought of the tons of explosive beneath\nhim that presently would literally blow him\nsky-high. And he thought of the millions of people\nthe world over who, at this moment, were hovering\nat radios and TV\u2019s anxiously awaiting the dawn of\nthe space age. Finally he thought of Dad and Mom,\nlost in that multitude of night watchers, and among\nthe few who were not primarily concerned with the\nscientific aspect of the experiment.",
        " He wondered if\nhe would ever see them again.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus sixty seconds!\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh knew that a warning flare was being sent\nup, to be followed by a whistle and a cloud of\nsmoke from one of the blockhouses. As he felt fear\ntrying to master him, he began reviewing all the\nthings he must remember and, above all, what to\ndo in an emergency.\n  \n \n  \u201cX minus ten seconds\u2014five\u2014four\u2014three\u2014two\u2014one\u2014FIRE!\u201d\n  \n \n  There was a mighty explosion at Skyharbor.\n  \n \n  The initial jolt which Marsh felt was much fiercer\nthan the gradually built up speed of the whirling\ncentrifuge in training. He was crushed deeply into\nhis contour chair. It felt as though someone were\npressing on his eyeballs; indeed, as if every organ in\nhis body were clinging to his backbone. But these\nfirst moments would be the worst. A gauge showed\na force of 7 G\u2019s on him\u2014equal to half a ton.\n  \n \n  He watched the Mach numbers rise on the dial\nin front of his eyes on an overhead panel. Each\nMach number represented that much times the\nspeed of sound, 1,090 feet per second, 740 miles an\nhour.\n  \n \n  Marsh knew \u201cBig Tom\u201d would blast for about a\nminute and a half under control of the automatic\npilot, at which time it would drop free at an altitude\nof twenty-five miles and sink Earthward in a\nmetal mesh \u2019chute.\n  \n 21\n  \n  Marsh\u2019s hurting eyes flicked to the outside temperature\ngauge. It was on a steady 67 degrees below\nzero Fahrenheit, and would be until he reached\ntwenty miles. A reflecting prism gave him a square\nof view of the sky outside. The clear deep blue of\nthe cloud-free stratosphere met his eyes.\n  \n \n  Mach 5, Mach 6, Mach 7 passed very quickly. He\nheard a rumble and felt a jerk. \u201cBig Tom\u201d was\nbreaking free. The first hurdle had been successfully\novercome, and the ship had already begun tilting\ninto its trajectory.\n  \n \n  There was a new surge of agony on his body as\nthe second stage picked up the acceleration at a\nforce of 7 G\u2019s again. Marsh clamped his jaws as the\nforce pulled his lips back from his teeth and\ndragged his cheek muscles down. The Mach numbers\ncontinued to rise\u201411, 12, 13\u2014to altitude 200\nmiles, the outer fringe of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThere was a slight lifting of the pressure on his\nbody. The rocket was still in the stratosphere, but\nthe sky was getting purple.\n  \n \n  Mach 14\u201410,000 miles an hour.\n  \n \n  \u201cDick\u201d would jettison any moment. Marsh had\nbeen aloft only about four minutes, but it had\nseemed an age, every tortured second of it.\n  \n 22\n  \n  There was another rumble as the second stage\nbroke free. Marsh felt a new surge directly beneath\nhim as his own occupied section, \u201cHarry,\u201d began\nblasting. It was comforting to realize he had successfully\nweathered those tons of exploding hydrazine\nand acid that could have reduced him to nothing\nif something had gone wrong. Although his\nspeed was still building up, the weight on him\nbegan to ease steadily as his body\u2019s inertia finally\nyielded to the sickeningly swift acceleration.\n  \n \n  The speedometer needle climbed to Mach 21, the\npeak velocity of the rocket, 16,000 miles per hour.\nHis altitude was 350 miles\u2014man\u2019s highest ascent.\nSlowly then, the speedometer began to drop back.\nMarsh heard the turbo pumps and jets go silent as\nthe \u201clift\u201d fuel was spent and rocket \u201cHarry\u201d began\nits free-flight orbit around Earth.\n  \n \n  The ship had reached a speed which exactly\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity, and it could,\ntheoretically, travel this way forever, provided no\nother outside force acted upon it. The effect on\nMarsh now was as if he had stopped moving. Relieved\nof the viselike pressure, his stomach and\nchest for a few seconds felt like inflated balloons.\n  \n \n  \u201cCadet Farnsworth,\u201d the voice of General Forsythe\nspoke into his helmet receiver, \u201care you all\nright?\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Marsh replied. \u201cThat is, I think so.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was good to hear a human voice again, something\nto hold onto in this crazy unreal world into\nwhich he had been hurtled.\n  \n \n  \u201cWe\u2019re getting the electronic readings from your\ngauges O.K.,\u201d the voice went on. \u201cThe doctor says\nyour pulse is satisfactory under the circumstances.\u201d\n  \n \n  It was queer having your pulse read from 350\nmiles up in the air.\n  \n 23\n  \n  Marsh realized, of course, that he was not truly\nin the \u201cair.\u201d A glance at his air-pressure gauge confirmed\nthis. He was virtually in a vacuum. The temperature\nand wind velocity outside might have astounded\nhim if he were not prepared for the readings.\nThe heat was over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit,\nand the wind velocity was of hurricane force! But\nthese figures meant nothing because of the sparseness\nof air molecules. Temperature and wind applied\nonly to the individual particles, which were\nthousands of feet apart.\n  \n \n  \u201cHow is your cosmic-ray count?\u201d asked the general.\n  \n \n  Marsh checked the C-ray counter on the panel\nfrom which clicking sounds were coming. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\nsir. Nothing to worry about.\u201d\n  \n \n  Cosmic rays, the most powerful emanations\nknown, were the only radiation in space that could\nnot be protected against. But in small doses they\nhad been found not to be dangerous.\n  \n \n  \u201cAs soon as our recorders get more of the figures\nyour telemeter is giving us,\u201d the operations chief\nsaid, \u201cyou can leave the rocket.\u201d\n  \n \n  When Marsh got the O.K. a few minutes later,\nhe eagerly unstrapped the belts around his body.\nHe could hardly contain his excitement at being\nthe first person to view the globe of Earth from\nspace. As he struggled to his feet, the lightness of\nzero gravity made him momentarily giddy, and it\ntook some minutes for him to adjust to the terribly\nstrange sensation.\n  \n 24\n  \n  He had disconnected the cable leading from his\nhelmet to the ship\u2019s transmitter and switched on\nthe ship\u2019s fast-lens movie camera that would photograph\nthe area covered by \u201cHarry.\u201d Then he was\nready to go outside. He pressed a button on the\nwall, and the first air-lock hatch opened. He floated\ninto the narrow alcove and closed the door in the\ncramped chamber behind him. He watched a\ngauge, and when it showed normal pressure and\ntemperature again, he opened the outside hatch,\nclosing it behind him. Had Marsh permitted the\nvacuum of space to contact the interior of the\nship\u2019s quarters, delicate instruments would have\nbeen ruined by the sudden decompression and loss\nof heat. Marsh fastened his safety line to the ship\nso that there was no chance of his becoming separated\nfrom it.\n  \n \n  Then he looked \u201cdownward,\u201d to experience the\nthrill of his life. Like a gigantic relief map, the\npanorama of Earth stretched across his vision. A\ndowny blanket of gray atmosphere spread over the\nwhole of it, and patches of clouds were seen floating\nlike phantom shapes beneath the clear vastness\nof the stratosphere. It was a stunning sight for\nMarsh, seeing the pinpoint lights of the night cities\nextending from horizon to horizon. It gave him\nan exhilarating feeling of being a king over it all.\n  \n 25\n  \n  Earth appeared to be rotating, but Marsh knew\nit was largely his own and the rocket\u2019s fast speed\nthat was responsible for the illusion. As he hung\nin this region of the exosphere, he was thankful for\nhis cadet training in zero gravity. A special machine,\ndeveloped only in recent years, simulated\nthe weightlessness of space and trained the cadets\nfor endurance in such artificial conditions.\n  \n \n  \u201cDescribe some of the things you see, Marshall,\u201d\nGeneral Forsythe said over Marsh\u2019s helmet receiver.\n\u201cI\u2019ve just cut in a recorder.\u201d\n  \n \n  \u201cIt\u2019s a scene almost beyond description, sir,\u201d\nMarsh said into the helmet mike. \u201cThe sky is\nthickly powdered with stars. The Milky Way is very\ndistinct, and I can make out lots of fuzzy spots that\nmust be star clusters and nebulae and comets. Mars\nis like an extremely bright taillight, and the moon\nis so strong it hurts my eyes as much as the direct\nsun does on earth.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh saw a faintly luminous blur pass beyond\nthe ship. It had been almost too sudden to catch.\nHe believed it to be a meteor diving Earthward at\na speed around forty-five miles a second. He reported\nthis to the general.\n  \n \n  As he brought his eyes down from the more distant\nfixtures of space to those closer by on Earth, a\nstrange thing happened. He was suddenly seized\nwith a fear of falling, although his zero-gravity\ntraining had been intended to prepare him against\nthis very thing. A cold sweat come out over his\nbody, and an uncontrollable panic threatened to\ntake hold of him.\n  \n 26\n  \n  He made a sudden movement as though to catch\nhimself. Forgetting the magnification of motion in\nfrictionless space and his own weightlessness, he\nwas shot quickly to the end of his safety line like a\ncracked whip. His body jerked at the taut end and\nthen sped swiftly back in reaction toward the ship,\nhead foremost. A collision could crack his helmet,\nexposing his body to decompression, causing him\nto swell like a balloon and finally explode.\n  \n \n  In the grip of numbing fear, only at the last moment\ndid he have the presence of mind to flip\nhis body in a half-cartwheel and bring his boots up\nin front of him for protection. His feet bumped\nagainst the rocket\u2019s side, and the motion sent him\nhurtling back out to the end of the safety line\nagain. This back-and-forth action occurred several\ntimes before he could stop completely.\n  \n \n  \u201cI\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d he panted to himself,\nas he thought of how close his space career had\ncome to being ended scarcely before it had begun.\n  \n \n  General Forsythe cut in with great concern, wondering\nwhat had happened. When Marsh had explained\nand the general seemed satisfied that Marsh\nhad recovered himself, he had Marsh go on with his\ndescription.\n  \n \n  His senseless fear having gone now, Marsh looked\ndown calmly, entranced as the features of the\nUnited States passed below his gaze. He named the\ncities he could identify, also the mountain ranges,\nlakes, and rivers, explaining just how they looked\nfrom 350 miles up. In only a fraction of an hour\u2019s\ntime, the rocket had traversed the entire country\nand was approaching the twinkling phosphorescence\nof the Atlantic.\n  \n 27\n  \n  Marsh asked if \u201cTom\u201d and \u201cDick\u201d had landed\nsafely.\n  \n \n  \u201c\u2018Tom\u2019 landed near Roswell, New Mexico,\u201d General\nForsythe told him, \u201cand the \u2019chute of the second\nsection has been reported seen north of Dallas.\nI think you\u2019d better start back now, Marshall. It\u2019ll\ntake us many months to analyze all the information\nwe\u2019ve gotten. We can\u2019t contact you very well on the\nother side of the world either, and thirdly, I don\u2019t\nwant you exposed to the sun\u2019s rays outside the\natmosphere in the Eastern Hemisphere any longer\nthan can be helped.\u201d\n  \n \n  Marsh tugged carefully on his safety line and\nfloated slowly back toward the ship. He entered\nthe air lock. Then, inside, he raised the angle of his\ncontour chair to upright position, facing the console\nof the ship\u2019s manual controls for the glide\nEarthward. He plugged in his telemeter helmet\ncable and buckled one of the straps across his waist.\n  \n \n  Since he was still moving at many thousands of\nmiles an hour, it would be suicide to plunge\nstraight downward. He and the glider would be\nturned into a meteoric torch. Rather, he would\nhave to spend considerable time soaring in and out\nof the atmosphere in braking ellipses until he\nreached much lower speed. Then the Earth\u2019s gravitational\npull would do the rest.\n  \n 28\n  \n  This was going to be the trickiest part of the operation,\nand the most dangerous. Where before,\nMarsh had depended on automatic controls to\nguide him, now much of the responsibility was on\nhis own judgment. He remembered the many\nhours he had sweated through to log his flying\ntime. Now he could look back on that period in his\ntraining and thank his lucky stars for it.\n  \n \n  He took the manual controls and angled into the\natmosphere. He carefully watched the AHF dial\u2014the\natmospheric heat friction gauge. When he had\nneared the dangerous incendiary point, with the\nship having literally become red-hot, he soared into\nthe frictionless vacuum again. He had to keep this\nup a long time in order to reduce his devastating\nspeed.\n  \n \n  It was something of a shock to him to leave the\nblack midnight of Earth\u2019s slumbering side for the\nbrilliant hemisphere where the people of Europe\nand Asia were going about their daytime tasks. He\nwould have liked to study this other half of the\nworld which he had glimpsed only a few times before\nin his supersonic test flights, but he knew this\nwould have to wait for future flights.\n  \n \n  Finally, after a long time, his velocity was slowed\nenough so that the tug of gravity was stronger than\nthe rocket\u2019s ability to pull up out of the atmosphere.\nAt this point, Marsh cut in \u201cHarry\u2019s\u201d forward\nbraking jets to check his falling speed.\n  \n \n  \u201cThere\u2019s something else to worry about,\u201d he\nthought to himself. \u201cWill old Harry hold together\nor will he fly apart in the crushing atmosphere?\u201d\n  \n 29\n  \n  The directional radio signals from the powerful\nSkyharbor transmitter were growing stronger as\nMarsh neared the shores of California. He could\nsee the winking lights of San Diego and Los\nAngeles, and farther inland the swinging thread\nthat was the beacon at Skyharbor. All planes in his\npath of flight had been grounded for the past few\nhours because of the space flight. The only ground\nlight scanning the skies was the gigantic space beacon\nin Phoenix.\n  \n \n  When Marsh reached Arizona, he began spiraling\ndownward over the state to kill the rest of his\naltitude and air speed. Even now the plane was a\nhurtling supersonic metal sliver streaking through\nthe night skies like a comet. He topped the snow-capped\nsummits of the towering San Francisco\nPeaks on the drive southward, and he recognized\nthe sprawling serpent of the Grand Canyon. Then\nhe was in the lower desert regions of moon-splashed\nsand and cactus. Although the fire-hot temperature\nof the outer skin had subsided, there had been damage\ndone to the walls and instruments, and possibly\nto other parts, too. Marsh was worried lest his outside\ncontrols might be too warped to give him a\ngood touchdown, if indeed he could get down safely\nat all.\n  \n \n  A few thousand feet up, Marsh lowered his landing\ngear. Now the only problem left was to land\nhimself and the valuable ship safely inside the narrow\nparallels of the airstrip. He circled the airport\nseveral times as his altitude continued to plummet.\n  \n 30\n  \n  The meter fell rapidly. His braking rocket fuel\nwas gone now. From here on in, he would be on\ngliding power alone.\n  \n \n  \u201cEasy does it, Marshall,\u201d the general said quietly\ninto his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re lining up fine. Level it out a\nlittle and keep straight with the approach lights.\nThat\u2019s fine. You\u2019re just about in.\u201d\n  \n \n  The lights of the airport seeming to rush up at\nhim, Marsh felt a jolt as the wheels touched ground\non the west end of the runway. He kept the ship\nsteady as it scurried along the smooth asphalt, losing\nthe last of its once tremendous velocity. The\nplane hit the restraining wire across the strip and\ncame to a sudden stop, shoving Marsh hard against\nthe single safety belt he wore. Finally, incredibly,\nthe ship was still and he was safe.\n  \n \n  He unfastened his strap and removed his space\nhelmet. The heat of the compartment brought the\nsweat out on his face. He rose on wobbly legs and\npressed the buttons to the hatches. The last door\nflew open to admit the cool, bracing air of Earth\nwhich he had wondered if he would ever inhale\nagain.\n  \n \n  His aloneness was over then, suddenly and boisterously,\nas men swarmed over him with congratulations,\neager questions, and looks of respect. Reporters\u2019\nflash bulbs popped, and he felt like a new\nLindbergh as he was pulled down to the ground\nand mobbed. Finally the police came to his rescue\nand pushed back the curiosity seekers and newspapermen.\nThen only three men were allowed\nthrough the cordon.\n  \n<doc-sep>For some twenty minutes, he raced through a dizzying, nightmare world\nof dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet.\n  \n \n  At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence. He saw\nthat he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the\ncity.\n  \n \n  He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette.\nA thousand stars\u2014a thousand motionless balls of silver fire\u2014shone\nabove him through Luna City's transparent dome.\n  \n \n  He was sorry he'd hit Cobb, of course. He was not sorry he'd run.\nEscaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision.\n  \n \n \n   You can do two things\n   \n  , he thought.\n  \n \n \n   You can give yourself up, and that's what a good officer would do.\nThat would eliminate the escape charge. You'd get off with voluntary\nmanslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in\nprison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you'd be free.\n   \n \n \n \n   But you'd be through with rockets and space. They don't want new\nmen over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class\njet-men on beat-up freighters\u2014they don't want convicted killers. You'd\nget the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by\npeeking through electric fences of spaceports.\n   \n \n \n \n   Or\u2014\n   \n \n \n  There were old wives' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who\noperated from the Solar System's frontiers. The spacemen weren't\noutlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth.\n  \n \n  And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the\nsouped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their\nheadquarters was Venus. Their leader\u2014a subject of popular and\nfantastic conjecture in the men's audiozines\u2014was rumored to be a\nred-bearded giant.\n  \n \n \n   So\n   \n  , Ben reflected,\n   \n   you can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously.\nYou can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your\nname. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your\nduty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from\nEarth.\n   \n \n \n  After all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant\nsecond, to destroy a man's life and his dream?\n  \n"

        "He'd noticed the dewed silver pitcher, but only now realized his\nthirst. Yet when she handed him a glass, he held it untasted and said\nawkwardly, \"I haven't introduced myself. I'm Jack Barry.\"\n  \n \n  She stared at his outstretched right hand, slowly extended her own\ntoward it, shook it up and down exactly once, then quickly dropped it.\n  \n \n  He chuckled and gulped some lemonade. \"I'm a biology student. Been\nworking at Wood's Hole the first part of the summer. But now I'm here\nto do research in marine ecology\u2014that's sort of sea-life patterns\u2014of\nthe in-shore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesserich. You\nknow about him, of course?\"\n  \n \n  She shook her head.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the greatest living biologist,\" he was proud to inform\nher. \"Human physiology as well. Tremendous geneticist. In a class\nwith Carlson and Jacques Loeb. Martin Kesserich\u2014he lives over there\nat town. I'm staying with him. You ought to have heard of him.\" He\ngrinned. \"Matter of fact, I'd never have met you if it hadn't been for\nMrs. Kesserich.\"\n  \n \n  The girl looked puzzled.\n  \n \n  Jack explained, \"The old boy's been off to Europe on some conferences,\nwon't be back for a couple days more. But I was to get started anyhow.\nWhen I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich\u2014she's a drab sort of\nperson\u2014said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of\ncourse, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice Pope,\" she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as\nif she were saying it for the first time.\n  \n \n  \"You're pretty shy, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  The question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this\nstrangely attractive girl dressed almost like a \"flapper.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you sit down?\" she asked him gravely.\n  \n \n  The rattan chair sighed under his weight. He made another effort to\ntalk. \"I'll bet you'll be glad when summer's over.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"So you'll be able to go back to the mainland.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I never go to the mainland.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you stay out here all winter?\" he asked incredulously, his\nmind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray and great gray waves.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are\nvery capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that's impossible!\" he said with sudden sympathetic anger. \"You\ncan't be shut off this way from people your own age!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the first one I ever met.\" She hesitated. \"I never saw a boy or\na man before, except in movies.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're joking!\"\n  \n \n  \"No, it's true.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why are they doing it to you?\" he demanded, leaning forward. \"Why\nare they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n  \n \n  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well\u2014not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n  \n \n  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n  \n \n  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n  \n \n  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n  \n \n  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed\u2014to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n  \n \n  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been\nMary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n  \n \n  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n  \n \n  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n  \n \n  The great biologist had come home.\n  \n<doc-sep>June stepped from the last shower stall into the locker room, zipped\noff her spacesuit with a sigh of relief, and contemplated herself in a\nwall mirror. Red hair, dark blue eyes, tall....\n  \n \n  \"I've got a good figure,\" she said thoughtfully.\n  \n \n  Max turned at the door. \"Why this sudden interest in your looks?\" he\nasked suspiciously. \"Do we stand here and admire you, or do we finally\nget something to eat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute.\" She went to a wall phone and dialed it carefully,\nusing a combination from the ship's directory. \"How're you doing, Pat?\"\n  \n \n  The phone picked up a hissing of water or spray. There was a startled\nchuckle. \"Voices, too! Hello, June. How do you tell a machine to go\njump in the lake?\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you hungry?\"\n  \n \n  \"No food since yesterday.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll have a banquet ready for you when you get out,\" she told Pat and\nhung up, smiling. Pat Mead's voice had a vitality and enjoyment which\nmade shipboard talk sound like sad artificial gaiety in contrast.\n  \n \n  They looked into the nearby small laboratory where twelve squealing\nhamsters were protestingly submitting to a small injection each of\nPat's blood. In most of them the injection was followed by one of\nantihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system\nwould treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human\nblood cells, and fight back against them violently.\n  \n \n  One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive,\nso that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human\ncells, and thus succumb more rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How ya doing, George?\" Max asked.\n  \n \n  \"Routine,\" George Barton grunted absently.\n  \n \n  On the way up the long spiral ramps to the dining hall, they passed a\nviewplate. It showed a long scene of mountains in the distance on the\nhorizon, and between them, rising step by step as they grew farther\naway, the low rolling hills, bronze and red with patches of clear green\nwhere there were fields.\n  \n \n  Someone was looking out, standing very still, as if she had been\nthere a long time\u2014Bess St. Clair, a Canadian woman. \"It looks like\nWinnipeg,\" she told them as they paused. \"When are you doctors going to\nlet us out of this blithering barberpole? Look,\" she pointed. \"See that\npatch of field on the south hillside, with the brook winding through\nit? I've staked that hillside for our house. When do we get out?\"\n  \n"

        "The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear\nwindows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of\nthe Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were\nbusy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and\nhis associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how\nto extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid\nand almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;\nmere details....\n  \n \n  Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up\nto the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with\nconsomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue\nsky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase\nwhile Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.\nLeaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim\ncigar\u2014his first in months\u2014and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney\nhad certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the\nbell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of\nwell-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n  \n \n  Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that\nthey were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no\nfurther opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated\nmovements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo\ninto his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him\nout.\n  \n \n  Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.\n\"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n  \n \n  He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.\nInexorably it pushed him flat.\n  \n \n  \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo\nbegan to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as\nhe drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,\nat that.\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n<doc-sep>The next room we examined was obviously for recreation. Containers were\nfilled with dozens of strange games and books of instructions in the\nform of simple drawings. The games were foreign, but designed in such a\nfashion that they would be interesting to Earthmen.\n  \n \n  Two of the rooms were sleeping quarters. The floors were covered with a\nspongy substance and the lights were dim and soothing.\n  \n \n  Another room contained a small bathing pool, running water,\nwaste-disposal units and yellow cakes of soap.\n  \n \n  The last room was an observatory. The ceiling and an entire wall were\ntransparent. Outside, the stars shone clearly for a few seconds, then\ndisappeared for an equal time, only to reappear in a different position.\n  \n \n  \"Hyper-space drive,\" Verana whispered softly. She was fascinated by\nthe movement of the stars. For years, our scientists had sought a\nhyperspatial drive to conquer the stars.\n  \n \n  We selected a comfortable chair facing the transparent wall, lit\ncigarettes and waited.\n  \n \n  A few minutes later, Marie entered the room.\n  \n \n  I noticed with some surprise that her face was calm. If she was\nexcited, her actions didn't betray it.\n  \n \n  She sat next to Verana.\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\" my wife asked.\n  \n \n  Marie crossed her legs and began in a rambling manner as if discussing\na new recipe, \"That was really a surprise, wasn't it? I was scared\nsilly, at first. That room was dark and I didn't know what to expect.\nSomething touched my head and I heard a telepathic voice\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Telepathic?\" Verana interrupted.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Well, this voice said not to worry and that it wasn't going to\nhurt me. It said it only wanted to learn something about us. It was\nthe\n   \n   oddest\n   \n  feeling! All the time, this voice kept talking to me in\na nice way and made me feel at ease ... and at the same time, I felt\n   \n   something\n   \n  search my mind and gather information. I could actually\n   \n   feel\n   \n  it search my memories!\"\n  \n \n  \"What memories?\" I inquired.\n  \n \n  She frowned with concentration. \"Memories of high school mostly. It\nseemed interested in English and history classes. And then it searched\nfor memories of our customs and lives in general....\"\n  \n"

        "II\n  \n \n  The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home\u2014a weathered white cube with\nnarrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola\u2014was nothing like its\nlavish interior.\n  \n \n  In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming\nfurniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless\nblack form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack\nthink of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered\nagain how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.\n  \n \n  Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the\nuneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were\nstill those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been\nwatching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.\n  \n \n \n \n  He asked abruptly, \"Do you know anything of a girl around here named\nMary Alice Pope?\"\n  \n \n  The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some\nbovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall\ncabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,\nopened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and\nhanded him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked\nin his breath with surprise.\n  \n \n  It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same\nflat-bosomed dress\u2014flowered rather than white\u2014no bandeau, same beads.\nSame proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.\n  \n \n  \"That is Mary Alice Pope,\" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat\nvoice. \"She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident\nin 1933.\"\n  \n \n  The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to\nreality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the\ngloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with\nwhat seemed a malicious eagerness.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" she said, \"and I'll tell you about it.\"\n  \n \n  Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question\u2014he\nwas much too dazed for that\u2014he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her\nposition on the edge of the sofa.\n  \n \n  \"You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love\nof Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as\nyou probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he\nfirst came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,\nthere was a cloak of loneliness about him\u2014or rather about the three of\nthem.\n  \n \n  \"Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud\u2014I\ndon't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a\nservant\u2014and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They\nshowered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't\nrealize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with\nMary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without\nmarrying, he was safe.\n  \n \n  \"Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred\nBritish stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point\nvery wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did\neverything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was\nafraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani\nand Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her\nfear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But\u2014and\nhere is where Mary's wisdom fell short\u2014her brave gesture did not\npacify them: it only increased their hatred.\n  \n \n  \"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.\nIt was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as\nnarrow and intense as his sisters hatred.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n  \n \n  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well\u2014not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n  \n \n  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n  \n \n  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n  \n \n  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n  \n \n  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed\u2014to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n  \n \n  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been\nMary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n  \n \n  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n  \n \n  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n  \n \n  The great biologist had come home.\n  \n<doc-sep>When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried\u2014tears at\nher own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful\nat understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding\nhim. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the\ncheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and\nthat she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the\nvery last.\n  \n \n  Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The\nsite proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a\ndozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether\nthis had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his\ndescendants were exceedingly inept planners.\n  \n \n  Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as\nMartin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible\nconvenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques,\ncarefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man\nfrom the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise,\nMartin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become\ndulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle\u2014\"architecturally\ndreadful, of course,\" Raymond had said, \"but so hilariously\ntypical\"\u2014impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level\naquarium.\n  \n \n  \"How about a moat?\" Martin suggested when they first came. \"It seems to\ngo with a castle.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?\" Raymond asked, amused.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, \"but it would make the place\nseem safer somehow.\"\n  \n \n  The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more\nnervous. He got Raymond's permission to take two suits of armor that\nstood in the front hall and present them to a local museum, because\nseveral times he fancied he saw them move. He also became an adept with\nthe ray gun and changed the surrounding landscape quite a bit with it,\nuntil Raymond warned that this might lead Conrad to them.\n  \n \n  During those early years, Martin's tutors were exchanged for the\nhigher-degreed ones that were now needful. The question inevitably\narose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At\nleast twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of\ntheir vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy\nsuch occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of\nentertainment.\n  \n"

Jack pulled back the diamond-patterned quilt and blinked\nthe sleep from his eyes. He expected his mind to be busy wondering\nabout Kesserich and his wife\u2014things said and half said last night\u2014but\nfound instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as\nif to a farthest island in a world of people.\n  \n \n  Downstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet\u2014he\nfelt behind it, but the key was gone\u2014he hurried down to the\nwaterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an\nafterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.\n  \n \n  The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  There\nwas eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the\nmast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous\nwith faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.\n  \n \n  After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky\nspine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures\nstruck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.\n  \n \n  This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the\ninnocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd\nbrought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence\nwhen he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.\n  \n \n  He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the\nsame time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.\n  \n \n  The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to\nspeak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never\ncome back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've\nbeen watching for you all morning.\"\n  \n \n  He tossed the newspapers over the fence. \"You don't have to read\nthem now,\" he told her. \"Just look at the datelines and a few of the\nheadlines.\"\n  \n \n  When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She\ntried unsuccessfully to speak.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You've been the victim of a scheme to make\nyou believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's\n1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why it's been done, though I\nthink I know who you really are.\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" the girl faltered, \"my aunts tell me it's 1933.\"\n  \n \n  \"They would.\"\n  \n \n  \"And there are the papers ... the magazines ... the radio.\"\n  \n \n  \"The papers are old ones. The radio's faked\u2014some sort of recording. I\ncould show you if I could get at it.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   These\n   \n  papers might be faked,\" she said, pointing to where she'd let\nthem drop on the ground.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said. \"Only old papers get yellow.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why would they do it to me?\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Come with me to the mainland, Mary.

When he spoke, his voice was rough and quick. \"A life\nthat's completely a lie, that's cut you off from the world.

Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n  \n \n  The great biologist had come home.\n  \n"

        "Suddenly he felt a surge of relief. He had noticed that the paper was\nyellow and brittle-edged.\n  \n \n  \"Why are you so interested in old newspapers?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't call day-before-yesterday's paper old,\" the girl objected,\npointing at the dateline: July 20, 1933.\n  \n \n  \"You're trying to joke,\" Jack told her.\n  \n \n  \"No, I'm not.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it's 1953.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now it's you who are joking.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the paper's yellow.\"\n  \n \n  \"The paper's always yellow.\"\n  \n \n  He laughed uneasily. \"Well, if you actually think it's 1933, perhaps\nyou're to be envied,\" he said, with a sardonic humor he didn't quite\nfeel. \"Then you can't know anything about the Second World War, or\ntelevision, or the V-2s, or Bikini bathing suits, or the atomic bomb,\nor\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop!\" She had sprung up and retreated around her chair, white-faced.\n\"I don't like what you're saying.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No, please! Jokes that may be quite harmless on the mainland sound\ndifferent here.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm really not joking,\" he said after a moment.\n  \n \n  She grew quite frantic at that. \"I can show you all last week's papers!\nI can show you magazines and other things. I can prove it!\"\n  \n \n  She started toward the house. He followed. He felt his heart begin to\npound.\n  \n \n  At the white door she paused, looking worriedly down the road. Jack\nthought he could hear the faint\n   \n   chug\n   \n  of a motorboat. She pushed open\nthe door and he followed her inside. The small-windowed room was dark\nafter the sunlight. Jack got an impression of solid old furniture, a\nfireplace with brass andirons.\n  \n \n  \"Flash!\" croaked a gritty voice. \"After their disastrous break day\nbefore yesterday, stocks are recovering. Leading issues....\"\n  \n \n  Jack realized that he had started and had involuntarily put his arm\naround the girl's shoulders. At the same time he noticed that the voice\nwas coming from the curved brown trumpet of an old-fashioned radio\nloudspeaker.\n  \n \n  The girl didn't pull away from him. He turned toward her. Although her\ngray eyes were on him, her attention had gone elsewhere.\n  \n \n  \"I can hear the car. They're coming back. They won't like it that\nyou're here.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right they won't like it.\"\n  \n \n  Her agitation grew. \"No, you must go.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll come back tomorrow,\" he heard himself saying.\n  \n \n  \"Flash! It looks as if the World Economic Conference may soon adjourn,\nmouthing jeers at old Uncle Sam who is generally referred to as Uncle\nShylock.\"\n  \n \n  Jack felt a numbness on his neck. The room seemed to be darkening, the\ngirl growing stranger still.\n  \n \n  \"You must go before they see you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Flash! Wiley Post has just completed his solo circuit of the Globe,\nafter a record-breaking flight of 7 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes.\nAsked how he felt after the energy-draining feat, Post quipped....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>There were two small items of interest to me in the Times the following\nmorning.\n  \n \n  One two-inch story\u2014barely making page one because of a hole to fill at\nthe bottom of an account of the number of victims of Indian summer heat\nprostration\u2014told of the incineration of a warehouse on Fleet Street by\nan ingenious new arson bomb that left \"virtually\" no trace. (Maybe the\nfire inspector had planted a few traces to make his explanation more\ncreditable.)\n  \n \n  The second item was further over in a science column just off the\neditorial page. It told of the government\u2014!\u2014developing a new process\nof waste disposal rivaling the old Buck Rogers disintegrator ray.\n  \n \n  This, I presumed, was one of Tony Carmen's information leaks.\n  \n \n  If he hoped to arouse the public into demanding my invention I\ndoubted he would succeed. The public had been told repeatedly of a\nnew radioactive process for preserving food and a painless way of\nspraying injections through the skin. But they were still stuck with\nrefrigerators and hypodermic needles.\n  \n \n  I had forced my way half-way through the paper and the terrible coffee\nI made when the doorbell rang.\n  \n \n  I was hardly surprised when it turned out to be Tony Carmen behind the\nfront door.\n  \n \n  He pushed in, slapping a rolled newspaper in his palm. \"Action,\nProfessor.\"\n  \n \n  \"The district attorney has indicted you?\" I asked hopefully.\n  \n \n  \"He's not even indicted\n   \n   you\n   \n  , Venetti. No, I got a feeler on this\nplant in the\n   \n   Times\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"The government will take over the invention, no\nmatter what the public wants.\"\n  \n \n  \"The public? Who cares about the public? The Arcivox corporation wants\nthis machine of yours. They have their agents tracing the plant now.\nThey will go from the columnist to his legman to my man and finally to\nyou. Won't be long before they get here. An hour maybe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arcivox makes radios and TV sets. What do they want with the\nExpendables?\"\n  \n \n  \"Opening up a new appliance line with real innovations. I hear they got\na new refrigerator. All open. Just shelves\u2014no doors or sides. They\nwant a revolutionary garbage disposal too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you own stock in the company? Is that how you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"I own stock in a competitor. That's how I know,\" Carmen informed me.\n\"Listen, Professor, you can sell to Arcivox and still keep control of\nthe patents through a separate corporation. And I'll give you 49% of\nits stock.\"\n  \n \n  This was Carmen's idea of a magnanimous offer for my invention. It\n   \n   was\n   \n  a pretty good offer\u201449% and my good health.\n  \n \n  \"But will the government let Arcivox have the machine for commercial\nuse?\"\n  \n \n  \"The government would let Arcivox have the hydrogen bomb if they found\na commercial use for it.\"\n  \n \n  There was a sturdy knock on the door, not a shrill ring of the bell.\n  \n \n  \"That must be Arcivox now,\" Carmen growled. \"They have the best\ndetectives in the business. You know what to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  I knew what to tell them.\n  \n<doc-sep>Untrimmed sumacs threw late-afternoon shadows on the discolored stucco\nfacade of the Elsby Public Library. Inside, Tremaine followed a\npaper-dry woman of indeterminate age to a rack of yellowed newsprint.\n  \n \n  \"You'll find back to nineteen-forty here,\" the librarian said. \"The\nolder are there in the shelves.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want nineteen-oh-one, if they go back that far.\"\n  \n \n  The woman darted a suspicious look at Tremaine. \"You have to handle\nthese old papers carefully.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be extremely careful.\" The woman sniffed, opened a drawer, leafed\nthrough it, muttering.\n  \n \n  \"What date was it you wanted?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nineteen-oh-one; the week of May nineteenth.\"\n  \n \n  The librarian pulled out a folded paper, placed it on the table,\nadjusted her glasses, squinted at the front page. \"That's it,\" she\nsaid. \"These papers keep pretty well, provided they're stored in the\ndark. But they're still flimsy, mind you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll remember.\" The woman stood by as Tremaine looked over the front\npage. The lead article concerned the opening of the Pan-American\nExposition at Buffalo. Vice-President Roosevelt had made a speech.\nTremaine leafed over, reading slowly.\n  \n \n  On page four, under a column headed\n   \n   County Notes\n   \n  he saw the name Bram:\n  \n \n  Mr. Bram has purchased a quarter section of fine grazing land,\nnorth of town, together with a sturdy house, from J. P. Spivey of\nElsby. Mr. Bram will occupy the home and will continue to graze a\nfew head of stock. Mr. Bram, who is a newcomer to the county, has\nbeen a resident of Mrs. Stoate's Guest Home in Elsby for the past\nmonths.\n  \n \n  \"May I see some earlier issues; from about the first of the year?\"\n  \n \n  The librarian produced the papers. Tremaine turned the pages, read the\nheads, skimmed an article here and there. The librarian went back to\nher desk. An hour later, in the issue for July 7, 1900, an item caught\nhis eye:\n  \n \n  A Severe Thunderstorm. Citizens of Elsby and the country were much\nalarmed by a violent cloudburst, accompanied by lightning and\nthunder, during the night of the fifth. A fire set in the pine\nwoods north of Spivey's farm destroyed a considerable amount of\ntimber and threatened the house before burning itself out along\nthe river.\n  \n \n  The librarian was at Tremaine's side. \"I have to close the library now.\nYou'll have to come back tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, the sky was sallow in the west: lights were coming on in\nwindows along the side streets. Tremaine turned up his collar against a\ncold wind that had risen, started along the street toward the hotel.\n  \n \n  A block away a black late-model sedan rounded a corner with a faint\nsqueal of tires and gunned past him, a heavy antenna mounted forward\nof the left rear tail fin whipping in the slipstream. Tremaine stopped\nshort, stared after the car.\n  \n \n  \"Damn!\" he said aloud. An elderly man veered, eyeing him sharply.\nTremaine set off at a run, covered the two blocks to the hotel, yanked\nopen the door to his car, slid into the seat, made a U-turn, and headed\nnorth after the police car.\n  \n"

Motherhood is sacred here on Earth and so, of course, in\nthe entire United Universe. You should have known that.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Michael blushed. He should indeed. For a year prior to his leaving the\nLodge, he had carefully studied the customs and tabus of the Universe\nso that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself,\nwith confidence and ease. Under the system of universal kinship, all\nthe customs and all the tabus of all the planets were the law on all\nthe other planets. For the Wise Ones had decided many years before\nthat wars arose from not understanding one's fellows, not sympathizing\nwith them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the\nsame laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be no\ndifferences, and hence no wars.\n  \n \n  Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred years\nthere had been no war in the United Universe, and there was peace and\nplenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar\nsystems\u2014injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepaths\nof Aldebaran were still trying to add\n   \n   thought\n   \n  to the statute).\n  \n \n  Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any\nreason for the Lodge's existence, any reason for a group of humans to\nretire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive\nforefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had,\nperhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the\nworld. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's\nface upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the\npast\u2014the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coal\nfurnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days?\n  \n \n  The Father Superior had smiled. \"You are not yet a fully fledged\nBrother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved\nyour majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why\ndon't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?\"\n  \n \n  Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying\nthe ways of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because\nhe had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his\npreparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had\npassed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was\nstill strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor,\nbut a logical race does not trust him.\n  \n \n  \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the\nEarthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names\nto it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n  \n \n  \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n  \n \n  \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans\nand fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision\non this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or\ndoes it exist alone?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n  \n \n  A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have\ntheorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own\ndecisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This\nseems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible\nsystem. Is it the system you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\"\nthe Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that\nthe logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead\nof going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n  \n \n  \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is\nnot involved here; a government exists, and some being is the\ngovernor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do\nthe work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is\nthis agreed?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n  \n \n  \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which\nare governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n  \n \n  The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered\nconversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to\nKorvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way\nunable to describe this government?\"\n  \n \n  \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to\nus?\" the Ruler went on.\n  \n \n  \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction,\nKorvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they\nwere no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n  \n \n  The plan was taking hold.\n  \n \n  The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to\nconfuse us,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to\nconfuse you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n  \n \n  \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer\nit if we see fit to do so.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your\ngovernment?\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward\nfrom a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and\nbegan. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he\nsaid in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects\nobey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in\nthe speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en\nact instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous\nRuler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady\njudgment.\"\n  \n \n  \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you\nwill define yours for us.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you\nwon't understand it.\"\n  \n \n  The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"None,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"But you are governed?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single\ndecision.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept\nthese decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to\naccept them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at\nthe technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their\nexpression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them,\nperfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth\nwasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n  \n \n  \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind\nhas been theorized, though we have met with no examples\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like\nyourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n  \n \n  \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why\nnot?\"\n  \n \n  \"We call our form of government\n   \n   democracy\n   \n  ,\" Korvin said. \"It means\nthe rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n  \n \n  One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each\nother?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can\nhave the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his\nforce, there can be no effective rule.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n  \n \n  One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take\nstudying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects\nto correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee\nanother stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting\nhomesick.\n  \n \n  It took three days\u2014but boredom never really had a chance to set in.\nKorvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped\nfor; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different\nmethod of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n  \n \n  Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n  \n \n  On the third day Korvin escaped.\n  \n \n  It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most\nlogical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious\nmind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to\nmake the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that,\nand killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated.\nThat couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to\nintervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n  \n \n  Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the\nproblem\n   \n   was\n   \n  insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of\nthinking.\n  \n \n  Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted\nto the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental\nsciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his\nentire plan, within seconds.\n  \n \n  But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this\nparticular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n  \n \n  The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his\nescape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep\nreflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby\u2014all\nquite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more\ncomplicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then\nspace-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n  \n \n  He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic\ntalents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive\nmessages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  \n \n \n   Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come\nmarauding out into space too soon. They've been given food\nfor thought\u2014nice indigestible food that's going to stick in\ntheir craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they\ncan't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be\ndemocratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What\nkeeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us\nobeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer\nself-interest, of course\u2014but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n   \n \n \n \n   With one government and one language, they just weren't\nequipped for translation. They were too efficient physically\nto try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences,\nno insight into my mind or their own\u2014and that means no\ntranslation.\n   \n \n \n \n   But\u2014damn it\u2014I wish I were home already.\n   \n \n \n \n   I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n   \n \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n"

They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\n  \n \n  The ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God!

And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n<doc-sep>Michael blushed. He should indeed. For a year prior to his leaving the\nLodge, he had carefully studied the customs and tabus of the Universe\nso that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself,\nwith confidence and ease. Under the system of universal kinship, all\nthe customs and all the tabus of all the planets were the law on all\nthe other planets. For the Wise Ones had decided many years before\nthat wars arose from not understanding one's fellows, not sympathizing\nwith them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the\nsame laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be no\ndifferences, and hence no wars.\n  \n \n  Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred years\nthere had been no war in the United Universe, and there was peace and\nplenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar\nsystems\u2014injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepaths\nof Aldebaran were still trying to add\n   \n   thought\n   \n  to the statute).\n  \n \n  Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any\nreason for the Lodge's existence, any reason for a group of humans to\nretire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive\nforefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had,\nperhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the\nworld. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's\nface upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the\npast\u2014the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coal\nfurnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days?\n  \n \n  The Father Superior had smiled. \"You are not yet a fully fledged\nBrother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved\nyour majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why\ndon't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?\"\n  \n \n  Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying\nthe ways of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because\nhe had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his\npreparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence.\n  \n"

The food consisted of tabloid synthetics\nand was tasteless. Michael knew that only primitive creatures waste\ntime and energy in growing and preparing natural foods. It was all a\nmatter of getting used to this stuff, he thought glumly, as he tried to\nchew food that was meant to be gulped.\n  \n \n  A ferret-eyed Yeddan appeared on the advideo. \"Do you suffer from\ngastric disorders?

With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened.

We hung onto what we found because the\nrisks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there.\nBut there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to\nall of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger\u2014and horror.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n"

Kroon nodded as if\nin satisfaction. He turned to the girl, \"And what is your opinion,\nDaughter of the City?\"\n  \n \n  Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future.\nShe said, \"He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so\ndespised in the city?\"\n  \n \n  Kroon answered, \"According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the\ncity. This, and other things.\"\n  \n \n  Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were\nthe elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if\nthere was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the\nrespect the crowd had accorded Nolette.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the\nCity. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars\nran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and\ngardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it\nbecame plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and\ncould build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets.\nYet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots\ndestroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for\nthis homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable\nagain. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the\nbuilding of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a\nsmall colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.\"\n  \n \n  \"This whole city is a machine!\" Eric asked.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet,\nin caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this,\nthat it translates thought into reality.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared. The idea was staggering.\n  \n \n  \"This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is\nnecessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting\ndevice capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any\nsort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this\nmaterial into the pattern already recorded from thought.\" Kroon paused.\n\"You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape.\nThink strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your\nmind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.\"\n  \n \n  Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before\nhim. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He\ndrank it, convinced completely.\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"And I am to destroy the City?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The time has come.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling\nbeauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.\n  \n \n  Kroon said, \"There are difficulties. The machine builds according to\nthe mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual\nin areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass.\nWe have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew\ndrunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and\ngreed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong\nis the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own\nevilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the\nbeauty they have lost here.\"\n  \n \n  Kroon sighed. \"The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even\nknow of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us,\nthe dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the\nmachine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we\nbuild and control the outward appearance of the city.\n  \n \n  \"We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient\nLegend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be\ndestroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that\nour people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power.\nThe instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze.\nIt is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man\nwould come.\"\n  \n \n  Eric said, \"I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a\nspace man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to\nprotect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield\nof some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come\nis inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?\"\n  \n \n  For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, \"The name Eric\nwas an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their\nthought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far\nflung kind to return.\"\n  \n \n  Eric nodded. He asked, \"What happens now?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from our people. If\nthe prediction is not soon fulfilled and you are not the Eric of the\nLegend, you may stay or go as you desire.\"\n  \n \n  \"My brother, Garve. What about him?\"\n  \n \n  \"He loves the city. He will also stay, though he will be outside this\nbuilding.\" Kroon clasped his hands. \"Nolette, will you show Eric his\nquarters?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Then one of the men cried, \"Fools! It is true. We must take no chance\nwith the whips. He would come back. But if he dies here before us now,\nthen we may forget the prophesy.\"\n  \n \n  The crowd murmured and a second voice cried, \"Get the sword, get the\nguards, and kill him at once!\"\n  \n \n  Eric tensed to break away but now it was too late. His captors were\nalert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed\nwith the pain.\n  \n \n  The crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing\ngleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before\nEric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut\ndownward across Eric's neck.\n  \n \n  A woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, \"Hold!\" And a\nmurmur of respect rippled through the crowd.\n  \n \n  \"Nolette! The Daughter of the City comes.\"\n  \n \n  Eric turned his gaze to the side and saw the woman who had spoken. She\nwas mounted upon a black horse with a jeweled bridle. She was young and\nher hair was long and free in the wind. She had ridden so softly across\nthe fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.\n  \n \n \n \n  She said, \"Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so\nthat I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me\nyour hand, stranger.\" She leaned down and grasped his hand. Eric shook\nhis arms free, and reached up and clung to the offered hand, thinking,\n\"If I pull her down perhaps I can use her as a shield.\" He tensed his\nmuscles and began to pull.\n  \n \n  She cried, \"No! You fool. Come up on the horse,\" and pulled back with\nan energy as fierce as his own. Then he had swung up on the horse, and\nthe animal leaped forward, its muffled gallop beating out a tattoo of\nfreedom.\n  \n \n  Eric clung tightly to the girl's waist. He could feel the young\nsuppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling\nback into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent\nthat made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply,\noddly happy as they rode.\n  \n \n  After five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the\ncity. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it\ncontrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city.\nIt was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched\namong enemies.\n  \n \n  The girl halted before the structure and said, \"Dismount here, Eric.\"\n  \n \n  Eric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had\nheld her. She said, \"Knock three times on the door. I will see you\nagain inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.\"\n  \n \n  Eric knocked on the door. The door was as plain as the building, made\nof a luminous plastic. It had all the beauty of the great gate door,\nbut a more timeless, more functional beauty.\n  \n \n  The door opened and an old man greeted Eric. \"Come in. The Council\nawaits you. Follow me, please.\"\n  \n \n  Eric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was\nobviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the\nroom, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building.\nSix men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a\nchair at the base of the T-shaped table.\n  \n \n  There was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric\nwatched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place\nthere. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had\nlacked with only the older men present. The man at her right, obviously\npresiding here looked at Eric and spoke. \"I am Kroon, the eldest of\nthe elders. We have brought you here to satisfy ourselves of your\nidentity. In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some\nsort of explanation.\" He glanced around the room and asked, \"What is\nthe judgment of the elders?\"\n  \n"

Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n   \n \n \n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a\nphantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he\ncame again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the\nwall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same\ntune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the\nwall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen\nwall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.\n  \n \n  He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. \"Eric,\" the voice said. \"Eric,\nyou did come back.\" The voice was his brother's, and he whirled,\nseeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of\nhis brother. The figure cried, \"The hat! You fool, get rid of that\nhat!\" The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked\nso hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung\naway and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.\n  \n \n  The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Garve was now more handsome\nthan ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, \"Come,\" and\nEric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.\n  \n \n  Garve said, \"Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet\nsomeone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from\nthis side of the city.\"\n  \n \n  Eric asked, \"You knew I'd come after you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. \"The Legend? Eric the\nBronze? What is this wild fantasy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not so loud!\" Garve's voice cautioned him. \"Of course the crowd called\nyou that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders\nbelieve so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy,\nsuperstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed\nthem. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the Bronze.\"\n  \n \n  Eric looked down at his sun tanned hands and flexed them. He loosened\nthe explosive pistol in its holster. At least he was going to be a well\narmed, well prepared Legend. And while one part of his mind marveled\nat the city and relaxed into a pleasure as deep as a dream, another\nstruggled with the almost forgotten desire to rescue his brother and\nescape. He asked, \"Who are the Elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are going to them, to the center of the city.\" Garve's voice\nsharpened, \"Keep your head down. I think the last two men we passed are\nlooking after us. Don't look back.\"\n  \n \n  After a moment Garve said, \"I think they are following us. Get ready\nto run. If we are separated, keep going until you reach City Center.\nThe Elders will be expecting you.\" Garve glanced back, and his voice\nsharpened, \"Now! Run!\"\n  \n \n  They ran. But as they ran figures began to converge upon them. Farther\nup the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.\n  \n \n  Garve cried, \"In here,\" and pulled Eric into a crevice between two\nbuildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes.\nThe soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.\n  \n \n  Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, \"Wait here. And if you\nvalue my life, don't use that gun.\" Then he was gone, running deerlike\ndown the street.\n  \n \n  For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and\ntwo men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. \"Let\nhim go. Get the other one. The other one.\"\n  \n \n  Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to\nconverge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in\nthe gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, \"If you value\nmy life don't use the gun.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing he could do. Eric stood quietly until he was taken\nprisoner. They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men\nheld his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly,\ncalculatingly. One of them said, \"Get the whips. If we whip him he will\nnot come back.\" The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could\nhardly hear it.\n  \n \n  There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's\nwords that these people were superstitious.\n  \n \n  He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the\nthin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, \"And can you\nso easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips\ndefeat the prophesy?\"\n  \n \n  There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood,\nfear-bound at his words. But there was no place to hide, and without\nthe use of his weapons Eric could not have gone far. He had to bluff it\nout.\n  \n<doc-sep>When Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about\nhim. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music.\nYet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man\ncame forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang\ndeafened Eric and the man cried, \"You are right. It is Eric the Bronze.\nBring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.\"\n  \n \n  The man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took\nfire with the blow. The crowd chanted, \"Whips, bring the whips,\" and\nfear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless\nfeet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed\nthrough the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates\nclosed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart\nhammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and\nlooked behind to be sure he was safe.\n  \n \n  The towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, \"Come back,\nEric North. Come back to the city.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until\nhis fists were raw, pleading for it to open and let him back.\n  \n \n  And deep inside him some part of his mind said, \"This is a madness you\ncannot escape. The city is evil, an evil like you have never known,\"\nand a fear as old as time coursed through his frame.\n  \n \n  He seized the copper hat from his head, and beat on the lotus carvings\nof the great door, crying, \"Let me in! Please, take me back into the\ncity.\"\n  \n \n  And as he beat the city changed. It became dull and sordid and evil, a\ncity of disgust, with every part offensive to the eye. The spires and\nminarets were gargoyles of hatred, twisted and misshapen, and the sound\nof the city was a macabre song of hate.\n  \n \n  He stared, and his back was chill with superstitions as old as the\nbeginning of man. The city flickered, changing before his eyes until it\nwas beautiful again.\n  \n \n  He stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the\nmotion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he\nstared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat\nhad not entirely failed him after all.\n  \n \n  He turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to\ncall he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when\nit began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps.\nAnd so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the\ncanal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and\nthe canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he\nwas beyond the range of the illusions.\n  \n \n  And now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem,\nand to understand something of the nature of the forces against which\nhe had been pitted.\n  \n \n  The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield\nagainst electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had\nfailed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised\npattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense\nagainst illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly\nto beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and\nthe machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as\nthe illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city,\nwhatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he\nhad seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they\nwere as ugly as the second city had been.\n  \n \n  Yet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the\narrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver\nindirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve\nNorth, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he\nwould have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they\nhad blasted whatever it was that lay in the canal floor, then it would\nbe time enough to tell Garve, and go down to see what was left.\n  \n \n  The ship rested easily on the flat sandstone area where he had\nestablished base camp. Its familiar lines brought a smile to Eric's\nface, a feeling of confidence now that tools and weapons were his again.\n  \n \n  He opened the door and entered. The lock doors were left open so that\nhe could enter directly into the body of the ship. He came in in a\nswift leap, calling, \"Garve! Hey, Garve, where are you?\"\n  \n \n  The ship remained mute. He prowled through it, calling, \"Garve,\"\nwondering where the young hothead had gone, and then he saw a note\nclipped to the control board of the ship. He tore it loose impatiently\nand began to read. Garve had scrawled:\n  \n \n  \"Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down\nto the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some\nsort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd\nbetter come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and\nI'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight\ndown the canal.\"\n  \n \n  Eric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently\nGarve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been\nso strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.\n  \n \n  Garve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric\nselected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They\nwere small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed\nwith smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That\nshould be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began\nwalking back to the canal.\n  \n"

His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race\u2014the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians\u2014resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians\u2014the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide\u2014very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts\u2014all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough\u2014in their own way\u2014but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  It all began on a Saturday\nnight at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  . If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli.

        "  The Beast-Jewel of Mars\n  \n \n  By V. E. THIESSEN\n  \n \n  The city was strange, fantastic, beautiful.\n   \n  He'd never been there before, yet already he\n   \n  was a fabulous legend\u2014a dire, hateful legend.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  He lay on his stomach, a lean man in faded one piece dungarees, and an\nodd metallic hat, peering over the side of the canal. Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n   \n \n \n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,\nhe lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't\nhave to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.\nThose questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the\npsychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what\nthey purported to be.\n  \n \n  Only one question of importance remained:\n  \n \n  What year was this?\n  \n \n  He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of\njubilation and excitement. The\n   \n   future\n   \n  ! Here was the opportunity for\nthe greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n  \n \n  Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering\ncities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.\nSomewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked\nbeside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of\nVenus\u2014somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars\nand returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel\ncould reach the stars!\n  \n \n  And\n   \n   he\n   \n  had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend\nhis life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the\nchallenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n  \n \n  \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll\nbe a job for me out there....\"\n  \n \n \n   If\u2014\n   \n \n \n  Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat\nin the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a\nway of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man\nrealize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still\nwouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The\nfellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,\nbut\u2014\n  \n \n  After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n  \n<doc-sep>The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n  \n"

She gasped but didn't cry out.\nScore one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed\nthe backs of her thighs gingerly\u2014and slowly, slowly, for the eddy\ncurrents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against\nrubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.\n  \n \n  The guard peered genially into her cell. \"You're okay, auntie.\" She\nproudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds.\nHe didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while\nshe attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male\nprisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was\ngrateful. At least she didn't have to live\n   \n   quite\n   \n  like a fig\u2014like an\nunderprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.\n  \n \n  Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably: \"What the hell's\nthe matter with you?\" He opened the door of the cell with an\nasbestos-handled key held in a canvas glove.\n  \n \n  Flock was in that cell and he was doubled over.\n  \n \n  The guard looked at him doubtfully. It could be a trick, maybe.\nCouldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real\nenough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: \"Cramps. I\u2014I\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.\" The guard lumbered around\nFlock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in\nhere, he told himself\u2014not for the first time. And imagine, some people\ndidn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he\nrealized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning.\nAlmost like meat scorching.\n  \n \n  It wasn't pleasant. He finished untying Flock and turned away; let the\nstinking wipe take care of his own troubles. He only had ten minutes to\nget all the way around Block O and the inmates complained like crazy if\nhe didn't make sure they all got the most possible free time. He was\npretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field. He was a little\nvain about it, even; at times he had been known to boast of his ability\nto make the rounds in two minutes, every time.\n  \n \n  Every time but this.\n  \n \n  For Flock moaned behind him, oddly close.\n  \n \n  The guard turned, but not quickly enough. There was\nFlock\u2014astonishingly, he was half out of his jacket; his arms hadn't\nbeen in the sleeves at all! And in one of the hands, incredibly, there\nwas something that glinted and smoked.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" croaked Flock, tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut\nwith pain.\n  \n \n  But it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining,\nsmoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though\nit had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God\nknows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how\u2014filed,\nfiled to sharpness over endless hours.\n  \n \n  No wonder Flock moaned\u2014the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly\ncooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv\nhad been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"All right,\" whispered Flock, \"just walk out the door and you won't get\nhurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell\nhim not to, you hear?\"\n  \n \n  He was nearly fainting with the pain.\n  \n \n  But he hadn't let go.\n  \n \n  He didn't let go. And he didn't stop.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  It was Flock on the phone to the warden\u2014Flock with his eyes still\nstreaming tears, Flock with Sauer standing right behind him, menacing\nthe two bound deck guards.\n  \n \n  Sauer shoved Flock out of the way. \"Hey, Warden!\" he said, and the\nvoice was a cheerful bray, though the serpent eyes were cold and\nhating. \"Warden, you got to get a medic in here. My boy Flock, he hurt\nhimself real bad and he needs a doctor.\" He gestured playfully at the\nguards with the shiv. \"I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got\nyour guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?\"\n  \n \n  And he snapped the connection.\n  \n \n  O'Leary said: \"Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!\"\n  \n \n  The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated,\nand picked up the long-distance phone.

And yet fewer than half a dozen men were involved.\n  \n \n  A handful of men, and the enormous bulk of the city-state quivered in\nevery limb and class. In its ten million homes, in its hundreds of\nthousands of public places, the city-state's people shook under the\nimpact of the news from the prison.\n  \n \n  For the news touched them where their fears lay. Riot! And not merely\na street brawl among roistering wipes, or a bar-room fight of greasers\nrelaxing from a hard day at the plant. The riot was down among the\ncorrupt sludge that underlay the state itself.

It's a prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.\"\n  \n \n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n  \n \n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\n  \n \n  He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n  \n \n  \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\n  \n \n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\n  \n \n  His face went blank.\n  \n \n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n  \n"

        "Gladney unexpectedly exploded. He had been awake for a long time,\nwatching Rat at the board. Wrenching loose a chest strap he attempted\nto sit up.\n  \n \n  \"Rat! Damn you Rat, listen to me!\n   \n   When're you going to start braking\n   \n  ,\nRat?\"\n  \n \n  \"I hear you.\" He turned on Gladney with dulled eyes. \"Lie down. You\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be damned if I'm going to lie here and let you drive us to Orion!\nWe must be near the half-way line! When are you going to start braking?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not brake,\" Rat answered sullenly. \"No, not brake.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Not brake?\n   \n  \" Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped\nfor him. \"Are you crazy, you skinny rat?\" Gray secured a hold on his\nshoulders and forced him down. \"You gotta brake! Don't you understand\nthat? You have to, you vacuum-skull!\" Gray was pleading with him to\nshut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. \"He's gotta brake! Make\nhim!\"\n  \n \n  \"He has a good point there, Rat,\" she spoke up. \"What about this\nhalf-way line?\"\n  \n \n  He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. \"We\npassed line. Three days ago, maybe.\" A shrug of shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Passed!\" Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.\n  \n \n  \"You catch on quick,\" Rat nodded. \"This six day, don't you know?\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.\n\"Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Rat shook his head and said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"But Roberds said eight days, and he\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\u2014he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days.\nNow only six.\" He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.\n\"Six days, no brake. No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see your point, and appreciate it,\" Gray cut in. \"But now what? This\ndeceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some\nthings I do!\"\n  \n \n  Rat refused the expected answer. \"Land tonight, I think. Never been to\nEarth before. Somebody meet us, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!\" Gladney cried.\nGray turned to him. \"The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for\n   \n   you\n   \n  !\" He laughed with real satisfaction. \"Oh yes, Rat, they'll be\nsomebody waiting for us all right.\" And then he added: \"If we land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, we land.\" Rat confided, glad to share a secret.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Gladney grated. \"But in how many little pieces?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.\" Patti Gray caught\nsomething new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed\nit, too.\n  \n \n  The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the\nvacated position.\n  \n \n  \"Earth!\" she shouted.\n  \n \n  \"Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just name it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Not drink long time. Some water?\"\n  \n \n  Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the\ntension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last\nshe appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.\n  \n \n  \"There isn't any left, Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. \"Tasted punk,\" he grinned at\nher.\n  \n \n  She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.\n  \n \n  \"Rat,\" she said presently, \"I want to ask you something, rather\npersonal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your\nrecord. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was\ncoming, did you?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again and waggled his head at her. \"No. Who tell Rat?\"\nSuddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. \"Rat a.w.o.l., go\nout to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send\ncall through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why didn't you explain?\"\n  \n \n  He grinned again. \"Who believe? Sick man die soon after.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. \"You're\nright, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now.\nYou've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as\nyou get out of the ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't!\" cried Patti Gray. \"They can't hurt him after what he's\ndone now.\"\n  \n \n  The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.\n  \n \n  \"Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth\npretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.\"\n  \n \n  Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: \"Say, I get it ... you're\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" Rat cut him off sharply. \"You talk too much.\" He cast a\nglance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney.\n  \n<doc-sep>When the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the\nchair.\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?\"\n  \n \n  \"True enough.\" Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed\ndoor, lowered his voice. \"It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there\nhas to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed\non a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she\ndies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital,\nI'm not too confident of that patching job.\" He pulled a pipe from a\njacket pocket. \"So, might as well kill two birds with one stone ... and\nthat wasn't meant to be funny!\"\n  \n \n  Peterson said nothing, sat watching the door.\n  \n \n  \"Rat has the right idea,\" Roberds continued, \"but I had already thought\nof it. About the bunks and lockers. Greaseball has been out there all\nnight tearing them out. We just\n   \n   might\n   \n  be able to hop by dawn ... and\nhell of a long, grinding hop it will be!\"\n  \n \n  The nurse came out of the door.\n  \n \n  \"How is she?\" Roberds asked.\n  \n \n  \"Sleeping,\" Gray whispered. \"But sinking....\"\n  \n \n  \"We can take off at dawn, I think.\" He filled the pipe and didn't look\nat her. \"You'll have to spend most of the trip in a hammock.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can take it.\" Suddenly she smiled, wanly. \"I was with the Fleet. How\nlong will it take?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eight days, in\n   \n   that\n   \n  ship.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson\nwas harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship\nmeant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in\nthat untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and\nGladney.\n  \n \n  \"Who was that ... man? The one you put out?\" Gray asked.\n  \n \n  \"We call him Rat,\" Roberds said.\n  \n \n  She didn't ask why. She said: \"Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean?\nWhat is his record?\"\n  \n \n  Peterson opened his mouth.\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, Peterson!\" the Chief snapped. \"We don't talk about his record\naround here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stow it, Chief,\" said Peterson. \"Miss Gray is no pantywaist.\" He\nturned to the nurse. \"Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?\"\n  \n \n  Patti Gray paled. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"Was Rat in that?\"\n  \n \n  Roberds shook his head. \"He didn't take part in it. But Rat was\nattached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch.\nAnd when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the\nGanymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.\n  \n \n  \"As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around\nCentauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps\non Mars a long time, finally landed up here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" protested Miss Gray, \"I don't understand? I always thought that\nleaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.\"\n  \n \n  The Chief Consul nodded. \"It does, usually. But this was a freak case.\nIt would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one\nword: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.\n  \n \n  \"Are you expecting the others in soon?\" she asked. \"It wouldn't be\nright to leave Peterson.\"\n  \n \n  \"They will be in, in a day or two. Peterson will beat it over to Base\nstation for repairs, and to notify Earth we're coming. He'll be all\nright.\"\n  \n \n  Abruptly she stood up. \"Goodnight gentlemen. Call me if I'm needed.\"\n  \n \n  Roberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind\nher. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.\n  \n \n  \"Damned rat!\" he whispered harshly. \"They ought to make a law forcing\nhim to wear dark glasses!\"\n  \n \n  Roberds smiled wearily. \"His eyes do get a man, don't they?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to burn 'em out!\" Peterson snarled.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  PRISON PLANET\n  \n \n  By BOB TUCKER\n  \n \n  To remain on Mars meant death from agonizing\n   \n  space-sickness, but Earth-surgery lay\n   \n  days of flight away.

Imagine Fawkes'\n   \n  terrible predicament; plenty of food\u2014and\n   \n  twenty seven beautiful girls for companions.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n  Jonathan Fawkes opened his eyes. He was flat on his back, and a girl\nwas bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the\ngirl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The\nsky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his\nbunk aboard the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"You're not dead?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to\nhis elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was\npert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n  \n \n  \"Is\u2014is anything broken?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his\nfeet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot\nwith Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a\nconcrete mixer.\"\n  \n \n  She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.\nIts nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It\nhad burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had\nsurvived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to\nJupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the\nwreckage.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He\nhad an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the\ntrouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on\nher course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling\ninto my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He\npaused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have\nbeen a cinder by this time,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic\nsmile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished\nthat pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I?\nI couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\n  \n \n  The girl shrugged her shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his\nsurprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across\nthe plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward\nhigher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain\nof mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated\ncone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just\nhe and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast\nrolling prairie.\n  \n \n  \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an\nasteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"We?\" he looked back at her.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,\nonly we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers\nAssociation enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\n  \n \n  She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n  \n \n  \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We hit this asteroid.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that was three years ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her\neyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self\nconscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw\nyour space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a\nheap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n  \n \n  \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about\nfour miles,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I think so,\" he said.\n  \n"

        " \n  PRISON PLANET\n  \n \n  By BOB TUCKER\n  \n \n  To remain on Mars meant death from agonizing\n   \n  space-sickness, but Earth-surgery lay\n   \n  days of flight away. And there was only\n   \n  a surface rocket in which to escape\u2014with\n   \n  a traitorous Ganymedean for its pilot.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1942.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"Listen, Rat!\" Roberds said, \"what\n   \n   I\n   \n  say goes around here. It doesn't\nhappen to be any of your business. I'm still in possession of my wits,\nand I know Peterson can't handle that ship. Furthermore Gladney will\nbe in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat,\nget this:\n   \n   I'm\n   \n  going to pilot that ship. Understand? Consulate or\nno Consulate, job or no job, I'm wheeling that crate to Earth because\nthis is an emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my\nposition, to me at any rate.\" His tone dropped to a deadly softness.\n\"Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?\"\n  \n \n  Unheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the\nwoman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look,\nwavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the\nstare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray\nalmost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it.\n  \n \n  \"Won't go!\" The Centaurian resumed his fight. \"You not go, lose job,\nblack-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.\" He retreated\na precious step to escape a rolled up fist. \"Little ship carry four\nnice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water\ntanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards,\nallright. I pilot ship. Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" Roberds screamed.\n  \n \n  Almost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the\noffice froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through\nthe narrow door.\n  \n \n  \"Peterson,\" the field manager ordered, \"come over here and help me\nthrow this rat out....\" He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his\nchair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"No need, no need, no need!\" he said quickly. \"I go.\" Still backing, he\nblindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Whew!\" Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too\nfamiliar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its\ncrowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear.\nShe loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her\nface tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted the other way. The\nCentaurian was grinning at her.\n  \n \n  \"Do you always leave in a hurry?\" she demanded, and instantly wished\nshe hadn't said it. He gave no outward sign.\n  \n \n  \"Long-time sleep,\" he announced. \"Four, five hours maybe.\" The chest\nstrap was lying loose at his side.\n  \n \n  \"That long!\" she was incredulous. \"I'm never out more than three\nhours!\" Unloosening more straps, she sat up, glanced at the control\npanel.\n  \n \n  \"Not taking time,\" he stated simply and pointed to a dial. Gray shook\nher head and looked at the others.\n  \n \n  \"That isn't doing either of them any good!\"\n  \n \n  Rat nodded unhappily. \"What's her matter\u2014?\" pointing.\n  \n \n  \"Appendix. Something about this atmosphere sends it haywire. The thing\nitself isn't diseased, but it starts manufacturing poison. Patient dies\nin a week unless it is taken out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't know it,\" he said briefly.\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say you don't have an appendix?\" she demanded.\n  \n \n  Rat folded his arms and considered this. \"Don't know. Maybe yes, maybe\nno. Where's it hurt?\"\n  \n \n  Gray pointed out the location. The Centaurian considered this further\nand drifted into long contemplation. Watching him, Gray remembered his\neyes that night ... only\n   \n   last\n   \n  night ... in the office. Peterson had\nrefused to meet them. After awhile Rat came out of it.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he waved. \"No appendix. Never nowhere appendix.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then Mother Nature has finally woke up!\" she exclaimed. \"But why do\nCentaurians rate it exclusively?\"\n  \n \n  Rat ignored this and asked one of her. \"What you and her doing up\nthere?\" He pointed back and up, to where Mars obliterated the stars.\n  \n \n  \"You might call it a pleasure jaunt. She's only seventeen. We came over\nin a cruiser belonging to her father; it was rather large and easy to\nhandle. But the cruise ended when she lost control of the ship because\nof an attack of space-appendicitis. The rest you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you?\"\n  \n \n  \"So I'm a combination nurse, governess, guard and what have you. Or\nwill be until we get back. After this, I'll probably be looking for\nwork.\" She shivered.\n  \n \n  \"Cold?\" he inquired concernedly.\n  \n \n  \"On the contrary, I'm too warm.\" She started to remove the blanket. Rat\nthrew up a hand to stop her.\n  \n \n  \"Leave on! Hot out here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm too hot now. I want to take it off!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Leave on. Wool blanket. Keep in body heat, yes. Keep out cold,\nyes. Keep in, keep out, likewise. See?\"\n  \n \n  Gray stared at him. \"I never thought of it that way before. Why of\ncourse! If it protects from one temperature, it will protect from\nanother. Isn't it silly of me not to know that?\" Heat pressing on her\nface accented the fact.\n  \n \n  \"What is your name?\" she asked. \"Your real one I mean.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned. \"Big. You couldn't say it. Sound like Christmas and\nbottlenose together real fast. Just say Rat. Everybody does.\" His eyes\nswept the panel and flashed back to her. \"Your name Gray. Have a front\nname?\"\n  \n \n  \"Patti.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty, Patti.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, just Patti. Say, what's the matter with the cooling system?\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn punk,\" he said. \"This crate for surface work. No space. Cooling\nsystem groan, damn punk. Won't keep cool here.\"\n  \n \n  \"And ...\" she followed up, \"it will get warmer as we go out?\"\n  \n \n  Rat turned back to his board in a brown study and carefully ignored\nher. Gray grasped an inkling of what the coming week could bring.\n  \n \n  \"But how about water?\" she demanded next. \"Is there enough?\"\n  \n \n  He faced about. \"For her\u2014\" nodding to Judith, \"and him\u2014\" to Gladney,\n\"yes. Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.\" Back to Gray. \"You,\nme ... twice a day. Too bad.\" His eyes drifted aft to the tank of\nwater. She followed. \"One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too\nbad. We get thirsty I think.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special\nenvironments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion\nchambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa\nGraybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard\nto bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.\n  \n \n  Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once\none of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on\nspaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he\ndecided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all\nhe learned about space travel.\n  \n \n  Nevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, or\ncellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. More\nimportant, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before and\nhad wanted to return.\n  \n \n  \"It's the Slider eggs,\" explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. \"The\nones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begun\nto die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to\ngo crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine\nthousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that\nflashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.\"\n  \n \n  Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could\nunderstand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while\nthe albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic\nfilaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played\ntiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life.\nElectrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but\nthe phenomenon remained a mystery.\n  \n \n  Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to\nquestion its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only\nrandom, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of\nlight, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.\n  \n \n  It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and\nfading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had\never seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have\nmade him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.\n  \n \n  \"You know what I think?\" Kershaw asked. \"I think those flashes are\nthe egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when\nyou scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes\nswooping out of nowhere at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been meaning to ask you,\" Asa said. \"How do you handle the\nSliders?\"\n  \n \n  Kershaw grinned.\n  \n \n  \"First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leaping\nfor home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand.\nWhen the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in\nthe mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back\nand hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter\ncomes\u2014and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake\u2014you live to\ntell the tale.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to\nlearn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another\nphysical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was\npounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the\ndoctor had apparently learned to make allowances.\n  \n \n  \"Swallow this,\" said the doctor after making a series of tests.\n  \n \n  Asa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginning\nto lose consciousness.\n  \n \n  \"This is it!\" he thought in panic.\n  \n \n  He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before\nconsciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance\nto back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the\nconversion tank right now.\n  \n \n  When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for\na long time he was afraid to open his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Come on, Graybar,\" said a deep, booming voice. \"Let's test our wings.\"\n  \n \n  It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his\neyes.\n  \n \n  Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one\nstand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that\nhis head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his\nlower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward\nso that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around\nas an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with\nbroad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like\nclaws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread of\nhair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.\n  \n \n  This, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.\n  \n \n  It would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strong\ntraces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardly\nemerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, under\nthose horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could\nstill weep.\n  \n \n  He started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Come to daddy, babykins,\" Kershaw said, holding out his hands. \"Only\ntry hopping this time. And take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Asa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerve\nand muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as high\nas Kershaw's head.\n  \n \n  \"That's the way,\" Kershaw said approvingly. \"Now get this on and we'll\ngo outside.\"\n  \n \n  Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of\nfabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as\nKershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room\nwhere they had been left to revive from conversion.\n  \n"

He cinched his\nsaddle and tied on some robes and furs behind it.\n  \n \n  Hill watched him curiously. \"What are you taking the furs for? This\nisn't the trading rocket.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. I thought that when we come back tonight, it might be cold and\nmaybe\n   \n   she'll\n   \n  appreciate the coverings then.\"\n  \n \n  \"You never would have thought of it yourself,\" Hill grunted. \"Grundy\nmust have told you to do it, the old fool.

She seemed to\nbe restless to end her fool's errand here, two hundred light years from\nthe waiting hordes on Earth. Straining metal plates twanged and echoed\nthrough her hallways.\n  \n \n  Captain Gwayne cursed and rolled over, reaching for his boots. He was\na big, rawboned man, barely forty; but ten years of responsibility\nhad pressed down his shoulders and put age-feigning hollows under his\nreddened eyes. The starlanes between Earth and her potential colonies\nwere rough on the men who traveled them now. He shuffled toward the\ncontrol room, grumbling at the heavy gravity.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Jane Corey looked up, nodding a blonde head at him as he\nmoved toward the ever-waiting pot of murky coffee. \"Morning, Bob. You\nneed a shave.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" He swallowed the hot coffee without tasting it, then ran a\nhand across the dark stubble on his chin. It could wait. \"Anything new\nduring the night?\"\n  \n \n  \"About a dozen blobs held something like a convention a little ways\nnorth of us. They broke up about an hour ago and streaked off into the\nclouds.\" The blobs were a peculiarity of this planet about which nobody\nknew anything. They looked like overgrown fireballs, but seemed to have\nan almost sentient curiosity about anything moving on the ground. \"And\nour two cadets sneaked out again. Barker followed them, but lost them\nin the murk. I've kept a signal going to guide them back.\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne swore softly to himself. Earth couldn't turn out enough starmen\nin the schools, so promising kids were being shipped out for training\nas cadets on their twelfth birthday. The two he'd drawn, Kaufman and\nPinelli, seemed to be totally devoid of any sense of caution.\n  \n \n  Of course there was no obvious need for caution here. The blobs hadn't\nseemed dangerous, and the local animals were apparently all herbivorous\nand harmless. They were ugly enough, looking like insects in spite of\ntheir internal skeletons, with anywhere from four to twelve legs each\non their segmented bodies. None acted like dangerous beasts.\n  \n \n  But\n   \n   something\n   \n  had happened to the exploration party fifteen years\nback, and to the more recent ship under Hennessy that was sent to check\nup.\n  \n<doc-sep>He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown\nup in a surfacing boat.\n  \n \n  \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we\nmight as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth,\nshe figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n  \n \n  \"How's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on\nEarth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way\nback in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with\nthe wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die\nor get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the\nplanets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal\nhusband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n  \n \n  The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody\nanura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a\nbellyful!\"\n  \n \n  He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been\nable to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little\nislands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a\nsurplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive\nplanet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in\nschool used to say.\n  \n \n  The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had\nto register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he\nthrew a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something\nnasty about the length of his hair; and\n   \n   imagine\n   \n  !\u2014he not only\nresisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he\nsassed the judge in open court!\n  \n \n  \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female\nattorneys. Told\n   \n   her\n   \n  that where\n   \n   I\n   \n  came from, a man spoke his piece\nwhen he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took\nmy last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the\nrest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for\na moment.

They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\n  \n \n  The ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made\nit!\"\n  \n \n  Another voice, shaking, said, \"President\u2014Davis is\u2014overwhelmed. He\ncan't go on. On his behalf and on behalf of all the people\u2014with our\nhope that was almost dead, we greet you.\" A pause. \"Please come in!\"\n  \n \n  The voice was silent. The air screamed against the hull of the ship.\n  \n \n  \"I can't tell them,\" said the man.\n  \n \n  \"Please come in!\" said the radio. \"Do you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  The woman looked up at the man. \"You've got to Michael!\"\n  \n \n  \"Two thousand years. From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one\ngrain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a\ncinder.\"\n  \n \n  A note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right?\nStand by! We're sending a rescue ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've got a right to know what we've found,\" said the woman. \"They\nsent us out. They've waited so long\u2014.\"\n  \n \n  He stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet\nthey could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right\nnow, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would\nbe over.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. A thousand of us died. You've got to think of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll go back out into space,\" he said. \"It's clean out there. I'm\ntired. Two thousand years of reincarnation.\"\n  \n \n  She spoke softly. \"We've been together for a long time. I've loved\nyou. I've asked very little. But I need to stay on Earth. Please,\nMichael.\"\n  \n \n  He looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to\nEarth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right. We're coming in.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ...

Once you spoil them,\nthey'll expect you to do all the trapping and the farming and the\nfamily-raising yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't have to sign up,\" Karl pointed out. \"You could have applied\nfor a wife from some different planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"One's probably just as good as another. They'll all have to work the\nfarms and raise families.\"\n  \n \n  Karl laughed and aimed a friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling\nup and headed into the thick forest.\n  \n<doc-sep>At first glance Theodor thought the Deep Space Bar was empty. Then he\nsaw a figure hunched monkeylike on the last stool, almost lost in the\nblue shadows, while behind the bar, her crystal dress blending with the\ntiers of sparkling glasses, stood a grave-eyed young girl who could\nhardly have been fifteen.\n  \n \n  The TV was saying, \"... in addition, a number of mysterious\ndisappearances of high-rating individuals have been reported. These\nare thought to be cases of misunderstanding, illusory apprehension,\nand impulse traveling\u2014a result of the unusual stresses of the time.\nFinally, a few suggestible individuals in various parts of the globe,\nespecially the Indian Peninsula, have declared themselves to be 'gods'\nand in some way responsible for current events.\n  \n \n  \"It is thought\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The girl switched off the TV and took Theodor's order, explaining\ncasually, \"Joe wanted to go to a Kometevskyite meeting, so I took over\nfor him.\" When she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced,\n\"I'll have a drink with you gentlemen,\" and squeezed herself a glass of\npomegranate juice.\n  \n \n  The monkeylike figure muttered, \"Scotch-and-soda,\" then turned toward\nEdmund and asked, \"And what is your reaction to all this, sir?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n"

        "Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and\npathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out\nin that miserable cold to meet him.\n  \n \n  The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not\ntoo clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than\nRossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were\ntears gathering in the ends of his eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Dylan, sir.\" His voice was low and did not carry. \"I have a\nmessage from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?\"\n  \n \n  Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. \"Nobody's in charge here. If you\nwant a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?\"\n  \n \n  The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.\nThen he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.\nIt was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He\nwas about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the\nhovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man\nappeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.\n  \n \n  \"C'n I go now, Jim?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan turned and nodded.\n  \n \n  \"Be back for you tonight,\" the young man called, and then, grinning,\nhe yelled \"Catch\" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and\nput it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A\nmoment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.\n  \n \n  \"Was he\n   \n   drunk\n   \n  ?\" Rossel began angrily. \"Was that a bottle of\n   \n   liquor\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the\nenvelope in Rossel's hand. \"You'd better read that and get moving. We\nhaven't much time.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As\nRossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but\ncould not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch\nthat, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy\nclouds and the cold.\n  \n \n \n \n  After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.\n  \n<doc-sep>An obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too well shaven\nface, Captain Dylan perched himself upon the edge of a table and\nlistened, one long booted leg swinging idly. One by one the colonists\nwere beginning to understand. War is huge and comes with great\nsuddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait,\nbetween acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage.\n  \n \n  Dylan waited. These people were taking it well, much better than those\nin the cities had taken it. But then, these were pioneers. Dylan\ngrinned. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake\nit and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly\nand inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and\nimpregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest; and set\nup automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee; and, without ever\nhaving lifted a finger, you have braved the wilderness, hewed a home\nout of the living rock and become a pioneer. Dylan grinned again. But\nat least this was better than the wailing of the cities.\n  \n \n  This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at all\nby any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an\noutcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing.\nHe stirred restlessly.\n  \n \n  By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn't much\nto say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: \"Lupus,\nLupus\u2014doesn't that mean wolves or something?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers. It was very\npossible that the aliens would be here soon, and there was no need for\ndiscussion. There was only one thing to do and that was to clear the\nhell out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it.\n  \n \n  But, when the fear had died down, the resentment came. A number of\nwomen began to cluster around Dylan and complain, working up their\nanger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and\nconfronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance.\n  \n \n  \"See here, soldier, this is our planet. I mean to say, this is our\n   \n   home\n   \n  . We demand some protection from the fleet. By God, we've been\npaying the freight for you boys all these years and it's high time you\nearned your keep. We demand....\"\n  \n \n  It went on and on while Dylan looked at the clock and waited. He hoped\nthat he could end this quickly. A big gloomy man was in front of him\nnow and giving him that name of ancient contempt, \"soldier boy.\" The\ngloomy man wanted to know where the fleet was.\n  \n \n  \"There is no fleet. There are a few hundred half-shot old tubs that\nwere obsolete before you were born. There are four or five new jobs for\nthe brass and the government. That's all the fleet there is.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Dylan wanted to go on about that, to remind them that nobody had wanted\nthe army, that the fleet had grown smaller and smaller ... but this was\nnot the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens might be\ncoming in right now for all he knew, and all they did was talk. He had\nrealized a long time ago that no peace-loving nation in the history\nof Earth had ever kept itself strong, and although peace was a noble\ndream, it was ended now and it was time to move.\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get going,\" he finally said, and there was quiet.\n\"Lieutenant Bossio has gone on to your sister colony at Planet Three of\nthis system. He'll return to pick me up by nightfall and I'm instructed\nto have you gone by then.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment they waited, and then one man abruptly walked off and\nthe rest followed quickly; in a moment they were all gone. One or two\nstopped long enough to complain about the fleet, and the big gloomy man\nsaid he wanted guns, that's all, and there wouldn't nobody get him off\nhis planet. When he left, Dylan breathed with relief and went out to\ncheck the bomb, grateful for the action.\n  \n \n  Most of it had to be done in the open. He found a metal bar in the\nradio shack and began chopping at the frozen ground, following the\nwire. It was the first thing he had done with his hands in weeks, and\nit felt fine.\n  \n \n  Dylan had been called up out of a bar\u2014he and Bossio\u2014and told what had\nhappened, and in three weeks now they had cleared four colonies. This\nwould be the last, and the tension here was beginning to get to him.\nAfter thirty years of hanging around and playing like the town drunk,\na man could not be expected to rush out and plug the breach, just like\nthat. It would take time.\n  \n \n  He rested, sweating, took a pull from the bottle on his hip.\n  \n \n  Before they sent him out on this trip they had made him a captain.\nWell, that was nice. After thirty years he was a captain. For thirty\nyears he had bummed all over the west end of space, had scraped his way\nalong the outer edges of Mankind, had waited and dozed and patrolled\nand got drunk, waiting always for something to happen. There were a lot\nof ways to pass the time while you waited for something to happen, and\nhe had done them all.\n  \n \n  Once he had even studied military tactics.\n  \n \n  He could not help smiling at that, even now. Damn it, he'd been green.\nBut he'd been only nineteen when his father died\u2014of a hernia, of a\ncrazy fool thing like a hernia that killed him just because he'd worked\ntoo long on a heavy planet\u2014and in those days the anti-war conditioning\nout on the Rim was not very strong. They talked a lot about guardians\nof the frontier, and they got him and some other kids and a broken-down\ndoctor. And ... now he was a captain.\n  \n \n  He bent his back savagely, digging at the ground. You wait and you wait\nand the edge goes off. This thing he had waited for all those damn days\nwas upon him now and there was nothing he could do but say the hell\nwith it and go home. Somewhere along the line, in some dark corner of\nthe bars or the jails, in one of the million soul-murdering insults\nwhich are reserved especially for peacetime soldiers, he had lost the\ncore of himself, and it didn't particularly matter. That was the point:\nit made no particular difference if he never got it back. He owed\nnobody. He was tugging at the wire and trying to think of something\npleasant from the old days, when the wire came loose in his hands.\n  \n \n  Although he had been, in his cynical way, expecting it, for a moment it\nthrew him and he just stared. The end was clean and bright. The wire\nhad just been cut.\n  \n"

Late in the year 2360\u2014the exact date remains unknown\u2014an alien\nforce attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage and\nthe dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the\narmy.\n  \n \n  When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists,\nthirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children,\nwere missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines,\neven books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were\nthe bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,\nnobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier\nfinally stumbled on something.\n  \n \n  For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main\nbuildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be\nburied in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow\na whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn\nvital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb\nat Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The\ndetonating wire had been cut.\n  \n \n  In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of\nearth, the wire had been dug up and cut.\n  \n \n  The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five\nhundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,\nweak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread\nthe news, and Man began to fall back.\n  \n \n  In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won\nstars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of\nthe colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died\nin fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those\nships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a\nsociety which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only\ndefense Earth had.\n  \n \n  This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth\nwith a bottle on his hip.\n  \n"

For this is the resting time, the time of peace,\nand so shall it be for a thousand years. And yet we shall summon him\nagain, my children, when we are sore in need, and out of the north he\nwill come, and again and again, each time we call, out of the dark and\nthe cold, with the fire in his hands, he will come.\n   \n \n \n  \u2014\n   \n   Scandinavian legend\n   \n \n \n \n  Throughout the night, thick clouds had been piling in the north; in\nthe morning, it was misty and cold. By eight o'clock a wet, heavy,\nsnow-smelling breeze had begun to set in, and because the crops were\nall down and the winter planting done, the colonists brewed hot coffee\nand remained inside. The wind blew steadily, icily from the north. It\nwas well below freezing when, some time after nine, an army ship landed\nin a field near the settlement.\n  \n \n  There was still time. There were some last brief moments in which the\ncolonists could act and feel as they had always done. They therefore\ngrumbled in annoyance. They wanted no soldiers here. The few who had\nconvenient windows stared out with distaste and a mild curiosity, but\nno one went out to greet them.\n  \n \n  After a while a rather tall, frail-looking man came out of the ship\nand stood upon the hard ground looking toward the village. He remained\nthere, waiting stiffly, his face turned from the wind. It was a silly\nthing to do. He was obviously not coming in, either out of pride or\njust plain orneriness.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I never,\" a nice lady said.\n  \n \n  \"What's he just\n   \n   standing\n   \n  there for?\" another lady said.\n  \n \n  And all of them thought: well, God knows what's in the mind of a\nsoldier, and right away many people concluded that he must be drunk.\nThe seed of peace was deeply planted in these people, in the children\nand the women, very, very deep. And because they had been taught, oh so\ncarefully, to hate war they had also been taught, quite incidentally,\nto despise soldiers.\n  \n \n  The lone man kept standing in the freezing wind.\n  \n<doc-sep>An obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too well shaven\nface, Captain Dylan perched himself upon the edge of a table and\nlistened, one long booted leg swinging idly. One by one the colonists\nwere beginning to understand. War is huge and comes with great\nsuddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait,\nbetween acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage.\n  \n \n  Dylan waited. These people were taking it well, much better than those\nin the cities had taken it. But then, these were pioneers. Dylan\ngrinned. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake\nit and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly\nand inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and\nimpregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest; and set\nup automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee; and, without ever\nhaving lifted a finger, you have braved the wilderness, hewed a home\nout of the living rock and become a pioneer. Dylan grinned again. But\nat least this was better than the wailing of the cities.\n  \n \n  This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at all\nby any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an\noutcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing.\nHe stirred restlessly.\n  \n \n  By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn't much\nto say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: \"Lupus,\nLupus\u2014doesn't that mean wolves or something?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers. It was very\npossible that the aliens would be here soon, and there was no need for\ndiscussion. There was only one thing to do and that was to clear the\nhell out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it.\n  \n \n  But, when the fear had died down, the resentment came. A number of\nwomen began to cluster around Dylan and complain, working up their\nanger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and\nconfronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance.\n  \n \n  \"See here, soldier, this is our planet. I mean to say, this is our\n   \n   home\n   \n  . We demand some protection from the fleet. By God, we've been\npaying the freight for you boys all these years and it's high time you\nearned your keep. We demand....\"\n  \n \n  It went on and on while Dylan looked at the clock and waited. He hoped\nthat he could end this quickly. A big gloomy man was in front of him\nnow and giving him that name of ancient contempt, \"soldier boy.\" The\ngloomy man wanted to know where the fleet was.\n  \n \n  \"There is no fleet. There are a few hundred half-shot old tubs that\nwere obsolete before you were born. There are four or five new jobs for\nthe brass and the government. That's all the fleet there is.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He was still tinkering when the soldiers came in. While they lined up\nalong the wall, he put Molly's head back on her neck.\n  \n \n  She gaped coyly at the new arrivals. \"Hello, boys,\" she simpered.\n\"Looking for a good time?\"\n  \n \n  Roddie slapped her to silence, reflecting briefly that there were many\nthings he didn't know about Molly. But there was work to be done.\nCarefully he framed the ritual words she'd taught him: \"Soldiers, come\nto attention and report!\"\n  \n \n  There were eleven of them, six feet tall, with four limbs and eight\nextremities. They stood uniformly, the thumbs on each pair of hands\ntouching along the center line of the legs, front feet turned out at an\nangle of forty-five degrees, rear feet turned inward at thirty degrees.\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" they chorused, \"we have met the enemy and he is ours.\"\n  \n \n  He inspected them. All were scratched and dented, but one in particular\nseemed badly damaged. His left arm was almost severed at the shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Come here, fellow,\" Roddie said. \"Let's see if I can fix that.\"\n  \n \n  The soldier took a step forward, lurched suddenly, stopped, and whipped\nout a bayonet.\n  \n \n  \"Death to Invaders!\" he yelled, and charged crazily.\n  \n \n \n  Molly stepped in front of him.\n  \n \n  \"You aren't being very nice to my baby,\" she murmured, and thrust her\nknitting needles into his eyes.\n  \n \n  Roddie jumped behind him, knocked off his helmet, and pressed a soft\nspot on his conical skull. The soldier collapsed to the floor.\n  \n"

        "It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was\nsilent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily,\n\"Maybe an animal?\"\n  \n \n  Dylan shook his head. \"No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or\nfound it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think?\nThe wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one\nis cut too\u2014newly cut.\"\n  \n \n  The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.\n  \n \n  \"So something,\" said Dylan, \"knew enough about this camp to know that\na bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that\nsomething didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the\ncenter of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then\nwalked right out again.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" said Rossel, \"I'd better go ask.\"\n  \n \n  He started away but Dylan caught his arm.\n  \n \n  \"Tell them to arm,\" he said, \"and try not to scare hell out of them.\nI'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.\"\n  \n \n  Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his\nhands.\n  \n \n  He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that\nhe'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was\nperhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.\n  \n \n  All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How?\nTelepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?\n  \n \n  No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there\nwould be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really\nknow.\n  \n \n  Were they small? Little animals?\n  \n \n  Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable\nbrain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large\nas a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long\nbefore a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly\nshown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.\n  \n \n  He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.\n  \n \n  He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he\nstraightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out\nhis pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last\ntime he had fired it. He never had\u2014he never had fired a gun.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  SOLDIER BOY\n  \n \n  By MICHAEL SHAARA\n  \n \n  Illustrated by EMSH\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction July 1953.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   It's one thing to laugh at a man because his job is useless\n    \n   and outdated\u2014another to depend on him when it suddenly isn't.\n   \n \n \n \n \n   In the northland, deep, and in a great cave, by an everburning fire\nthe Warrior sleeps.

Those were vitamin pills; the big red and\nyellow ones were sleeping capsules. He gulped the pill.\n  \n \n  Ann looked disapproving in a wifely way. \"Lately you chew pills like\npopcorn,\" she said. \"Do you really need so many?\"\n  \n \n  \"I need something. I'm sure losing my grip.\"\n  \n \n  Ann stared at him. \"Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost\nyour lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot. We're young\nyet.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n  \n \n  For once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n  \n \n  \"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n  \n \n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>As if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n  \n \n  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n  \n \n  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n  \n \n  Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while\nmopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.\n  \n \n  Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: \"Butch!\"\n  \n \n  But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Then how is it, Hal,\" he asked, \"that light comes out of the bubble,\nif the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward\nus, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light\ncoming our way disappear, too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well\u2014you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once more the interpreter helped him out.\n  \n \n  \"The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope. Like atoms of\none element, photons of a single frequency also have isotopes. It's\nmore than a matter of polarization. One of these isotopes of light\ntends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of the\nlight goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.\nBut one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into the\nTime Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater,\nyou haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we're\ngetting only a single isotope of the original light. Incidentally, no\nisotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts are\nbeing made to synthesize them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, explanations!\" murmured one of the newly arrived girls. \"The cubs\nare always angling for them. Apple-polishers!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  like this show,\" a familiar voice announced serenely. \"They cut\nanybody yet with those choppers?\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked down beside him. \"Butch! How did you manage to get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?\"\n  \n \n  \"But how\n   \n   did\n   \n  you get in\u2014Butcher?\"\n  \n"

        "Sometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway\u2014for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped\u2014and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014er\u2014you see, Joggy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it\ncertainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes\nof carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater\nand just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but\nthen my sprained ankle had got worse\u2014I kind of tried to get up and\nfell down again\u2014so he picked me up and carried me right through the\nusher.\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You\ntricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed\nyours, going through the usher. I really\n   \n   have\n   \n  heard it's dangerous\nfor you under-fives to be in here.\"\n  \n \n  \"The way those cubs beg for babying and get it!\" one of the girls\ncommented. \"Talk about sex favoritism!\" She and her companion withdrew\nto the far end of the cubicle.\n  \n \n  The Butcher grinned at them briefly and concentrated his attention on\nthe scene in the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Those big dogs\u2014\" he began suddenly. \"Brute must have smelled 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly,\" Hal said. \"Smells can't come out of the Time Bubble.\nSmells haven't any isotopes and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted. \"I bet somebody'll figure out\nsomeday how to use the bubble for time traveling.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't travel in a point of view,\" Hal contradicted, \"and that's\nall the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real\nat all, but a\u2014uh\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe,\" the interpreter cut in smoothly, \"that you're thinking\nof the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory. Some\nscientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and\nthat the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but\never-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is\nonly a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used\nfor time traveling\u2014just as it may be a similar disability that keeps\na robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real\nman or animal.\n  \n \n  \"It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and\nother beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time\nTheater. But do not be alarmed. Even if the minority theory should\nprove true\u2014and no evidence for it has ever appeared\u2014there are\nautomatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any\nharmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible,\nremember) in either direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sissies!\" was the Butcher's comment.\n  \n<doc-sep>The gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n  \n \n  For once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n  \n \n  \"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n  \n \n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n  \n \n"

        "Jeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished\nhe could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the\nmustachioed man at the next table.\n  \n \n  The fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his\nconfident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?\n  \n \n  Ann whispered, \"So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I\nthink I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff shrugged his big shoulders. \"If he's following us, he's nuts.\nWe've got no secrets and no money.\"\n  \n \n  \"It must be my maddening beauty,\" said Ann.\n  \n \n  \"I'll kick him cross-eyed if he starts anything,\" Jeff said. \"I'm just\nin the mood.\"\n  \n \n  Ann giggled. \"Honey, what big veins you have! Forget him. Let's talk\nabout the engineering lab you're going to start. And let's eat.\"\n  \n \n  He groaned. \"I lose my appetite every time I think about the building\nbeing sold. It isn't worth the twelve grand. I wouldn't buy it for that\nif I could. What burns me is that, five years ago, I could have bought\nit for two thousand.\"\n  \n \n  \"If only we could go back five years.\" She shrugged fatalistically.\n\"But since we can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The character at the next table leaned over and spoke to them,\ngrinning. \"You like to get away? You wish to go back?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman,\nwith extra gall.\n  \n \n  \"Not now, thanks,\" Jeff said. \"Haven't time.\"\n  \n \n  The man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.\n\"Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five\nyears. Maybe I help you.\"\n  \n \n  He spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was\nyellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized\nthe bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.\n  \n \n  Ann smiled back at him. \"You talk as if you could take us back to 1952.\nIs that what you really mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff rose to go. \"Mister, you better get to a doctor.

Their minds were busy with Jeff's troubles.\n  \n \n  \"You're still the smartest color engineer in television,\" Ann told Jeff\nas they dallied with their food. \"You'll bounce back. Now eat your\nsupper.\"\n  \n \n  \"This beanery is too noisy and hot,\" he grumbled. \"I can't eat. Can't\ntalk. Can't think.\" He took a silver pillbox from his pocket and\nfumbled for a black one. Those were vitamin pills; the big red and\nyellow ones were sleeping capsules. He gulped the pill.\n  \n \n  Ann looked disapproving in a wifely way. \"Lately you chew pills like\npopcorn,\" she said. \"Do you really need so many?\"\n  \n \n  \"I need something. I'm sure losing my grip.\"\n  \n \n  Ann stared at him. \"Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost\nyour lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot.

Let's\nchat with the gent.\" She added in an undertone to Jeff, \"Must be a\npsycho\u2014but sort of an inspired one.\"\n  \n \n  The man said to Ann, \"You are kind lady, I think. Good to crazy people.\nI join you.\"\n  \n \n  He did not wait for consent, but slid into a seat at their table with\nan easy grace that was almost arrogant.\n  \n \n  \"You are unhappy in 1957,\" he went on. \"Discouraged. Restless. Why not\ntake trip to another time?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Ann said gaily. \"How much does it cost?\"\n  \n \n  \"Free trial trip. Cost nothing. See whether you like. Then maybe we\ntalk money.\" He handed Jeff a card made of a stiff plastic substance.\n  \n \n  Jeff glanced at it, then handed it to Ann with a half-smile. It read:\n  \n \n  4-D TRAVEL BEURO\n   \n  Greet Snader, Traffic Ajent\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader's bureau is different,\" Jeff said to his wife. \"He even\nspells it different.\"\n  \n \n  Snader chuckled. \"I come from other time. We spell otherwise.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean you come from the future?\"\n  \n \n  \"Just different time. I show you. You come with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come where?\" Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man\ndidn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and\nforce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on little trip to different time,\" invited Snader. He added\npersuasively, \"Could be back here in hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would be painless, I suppose?\" Jeff gave it a touch of derision.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every\nday. I look damaged?\"\n  \n \n  As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and\nhis nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff\npolitely agreed that he did not look damaged.\n  \n \n  Ann was enjoying this. \"Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time\ntravel work?\"\n  \n \n  \"Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too\ncomplicated.\" He flashed his white teeth. \"You think time travel not\npossible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  Ann said, \"Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.\"\n  \n \n  \"Invite many people,\" Snader said quickly. \"Not expensive. You know\nMissing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go\nwith me to other time. Many stay.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure,\" Jeff said. \"But how do you select the ones to invite?\"\n  \n \n  \"Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.\"\n  \n"

    [
        "Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was\nElliott?\n  \n \n  Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. \"Mr. Snader, you\nheard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good\nchance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the\npast and correct mistakes they've made?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't you wish it were true?\" she sighed to Jeff.\n  \n \n  \"You afraid to believe,\" said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his\nrestless eyes. \"Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station.\nVery near here.\"\n  \n \n  Ann jumped up. \"It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's\nmadness\u2014a yearning to forget his troubles. \"Okay, just for kicks. But\nwe go in my car.\"\n  \n \n  Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like\ngrace of his short, broad body.\n  \n \n  \"This is no ordinary oddball,\" Jeff told Ann. \"He's tricky. He's got\nsome gimmick.\"\n  \n \n  \"First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,\" Ann said.\n\"Now I wonder who's kidding whom.\" She concluded thoughtfully, \"He's\nkind of handsome, in a tough way.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Snader's \"station\" proved to be a middle-sized, middle-cost home in a\ngood neighborhood. Lights glowed in the windows. Jeff could hear the\nwhisper of traffic on a boulevard a few blocks away. Through the warm\ndusk, he could dimly see the mountains on the horizon. All was peaceful.\n  \n \n  Snader unlocked the front door with a key which he drew from a fine\nmetal chain around his neck. He swept open the front door with a\nflourish and beamed at them, but Ann drew back.\n  \n \n  \"'Walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,'\" she murmured to\nJeff. \"This could be a gambling hell. Or a dope den.\"\n  \n \n  \"No matter what kind of clip joint, it can't clip us much,\" he said.\n\"There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for\nsome daffy religious sect.\"\n  \n \n  They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader\nsaid, \"Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.\"\n  \n \n  The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the\nnext room, after a glance at Snader's key.\n  \n \n  The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut\nafter them.\n  \n \n  The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the\nwalls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle\nof the ceiling and two movie screens\u2014or were they giant television\nscreens?\u2014occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.\n  \n \n  The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an\narrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word\n   \n   Ante\n   \n  , and to\nthe right with the word\n   \n   Post\n   \n  .\n  \n \n \n \n  Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One\nappeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like\na railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left\nwall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined\ncorridor moved toward him from that direction.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody worked hard on this layout,\" he said to Snader. \"What's it\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  \"Time travel,\" said Snader. \"You like?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of\ntime, I suppose?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>A tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them\nheartily.\n  \n \n  \"Solid man, Greet!\" he exclaimed. \"You're a real scratcher! And is this\nour sharp?\" He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.\n  \n \n  \"Just what you order,\" Snader said proudly. \"His name\u2014Jeff Elliott.\nFine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann\nElliott.\"\n  \n \n  The old man rubbed his smooth hands together. \"Prime! I wish joy,\" he\nsaid to Ann and Jeff. \"I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.\"\n  \n \n  He led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out\non the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and\nin it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted\na perfunctory \"Wish joy\" when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes\nstudied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.\n  \n \n  Snader did not sit down, however. \"No need for me now,\" he said, and\nmoved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.\n  \n \n  Bullen nodded. \"You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here, wait a minute!\" Jeff called. But Snader was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Sit still,\" Bullen growled to Jeff. \"You understand radioptics?\"\n  \n \n  The blood went to Jeff's head. \"My business is television, if that's\nwhat you mean. What's this about?\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell him, Kersey,\" the big man said, and stared out the window.\n  \n \n  Kersey began, \"You understand, I think, that you have come back in\ntime. About six years back.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's a matter of opinion, but go on.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr.\nDumont Bullen.\" He nodded toward the big man. \"Chromatics have not\nyet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well\nunderstood in your time, are they not?\"\n  \n \n  \"What's chromatics? Color television?\"\n  \n \n  \"Exactly. You are an expert in\u2014ah\u2014colored television, I think.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff nodded. \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  The old man beamed at him. \"You are here to work for our company. You\nwill enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff stood up. \"Don't tell me who I'll work for.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Jeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the\nscreen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or\nmotion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.\n  \n \n  In fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the\nchair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them,\nthey faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a\ndark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.\n  \n \n  The square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like\nthe waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the\nceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the\ndark tunnel again.\n  \n \n  Ann was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. \"Fun, hey? Like Alice\nthrough the looking-glass.\"\n  \n \n  \"You really think we're going back in time?\" she whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to\nfigure it out yet.\"\n  \n \n  Another lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when\nthey had flickered through it, another and then another.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Snader,\" Ann said unsteadily, \"how long\u2014how many years back are\nyou taking us?\"\n  \n \n  Snader was humming to himself. \"Six years. Station 725 fine place to\nstop.\"\n  \n \n  For a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. \"Six years\nago, your dad was alive,\" he mused to Ann. \"If this should somehow be\nreal, we could see him again.\"\n  \n \n  \"We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember?\nWould we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Snader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was\nmoving through a room numbered 724.\n  \n \n  \"Soon now,\" Snader grunted happily. \"Then no more questions.\"\n  \n \n  He took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by\na room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.\n  \n \n \n \n  Again there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a\nbright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of\nthe room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous\nclub-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.\n  \n \n  \"The same room,\" Ann said in disappointment. \"They just changed the\nnumber. We haven't been anywhere.\"\n  \n"

Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\n   \n   Cond. of\nObs.\n   \n  He noted the proper figures under the headings\n   \n   Sun Spots\n   \n  :\n   \n   Max\nFreq.\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   Min. Freq.\n   \n  ; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\n  \n \n  This done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Weather forecast for Terra\n   \n  ,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\n  \n \n  The audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\n  \n \n  Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  , Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right, Isobar.

I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\n  \n \n  South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\n  \n<doc-sep>Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n  \n \n  \"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n  \n \n  \"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Roberts shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar's last hope flickered out.\n  \n \n  \"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\n  \n \n  Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are\n   \n   you\n   \n  doing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\n   \n   the pipes!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\n  \n \n  Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n  \n \n  \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\n   \n   Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Roberts moaned.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\n  \n \n  And Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n  \n \n  \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing.

He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n  \n \n  \"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way.

All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\n  \n \n  He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, boys!

The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n  \n \n  \"After you? Those Grannies?

His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\n   \n   impervite\n   \n  hemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n  \n \n  \"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\n  \n \n  Excitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n  \n \n  \"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick.

Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I\nguess I can play it if I want to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in\n   \n   my\n   \n  cubby! I've got sensitive\neardrums. Well, stir your stumps!

Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\n  \n \n  He didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n  \n \n  \"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble?

Watch the birdie!\"\n  \n \n  He twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n  \n \n  \"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\n  \n \n  The now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, it's\n   \n   you\n   \n  ? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know?

        " \n  TROUBLE ON TYCHO\n  \n \n  By NELSON S. BOND\n  \n \n  Isobar and his squeeze-pipes were the bane of\n   \n  the Moon Station's existence. But there came\n   \n  the day when his comrades found that the worth\n   \n  of a man lies sometimes in his nuisance value.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories March 1943.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The audiophone buzzed thrice\u2014one long, followed by two shorts\u2014and\nIsobar Jones pressed the stud activating its glowing scanner-disc.\n  \n \n  \"Hummm?\" he said absent-mindedly.\n  \n \n  The selenoplate glowed faintly, and the image of the Dome Commander\nappeared.\n  \n \n  \"Report ready, Jones?\"\n  \n \n  \"Almost,\" acknowledged Isobar gloomily. \"It prob'ly ain't right,\nthough. How anybody can be expected to get\n   \n   anything\n   \n  right on this\ndagnabbed hunk o' green cheese\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Send it up,\" interrupted Colonel Eagan, \"as soon as you can. Sparks is\nmaking Terra contact now. That is all.\"\n  \n \n  \"That ain't all!\" declared Isobar indignantly. \"How about my bag\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  It\n   \n   was all\n   \n  , so far as the D.C. was concerned. Isobar was talking\nto himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, \"Nuts!\" and returned to\nhis duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word \"Clear\" which,\nsix months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed:\n   \n   Cond. of\nObs.\n   \n  He noted the proper figures under the headings\n   \n   Sun Spots\n   \n  :\n   \n   Max\nFreq.\n   \n  \u2014\n   \n   Min. Freq.\n   \n  ; then he sketched careful curves in blue and red\nink upon the Mercator projection of Earth which was his daily work\nsheet.\n  \n \n  This done, he drew a clean sheet of paper out of his desk drawer,\nfrowned thoughtfully at the tabulated results of his observations, and\nbegan writing.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Weather forecast for Terra\n   \n  ,\" he wrote, his pen making scratching\nsounds.\n  \n \n  The audiophone rasped again. Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\n  \n \n  Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  , Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather\nin Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\n  \n \n  South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\n  \n<doc-sep>Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n  \n \n  \"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n  \n \n  \"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Roberts shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar's last hope flickered out.\n  \n \n  \"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\n  \n \n  Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are\n   \n   you\n   \n  doing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\n   \n   the pipes!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\n  \n \n  Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n  \n \n  \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\n   \n   Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Roberts moaned.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\n  \n \n  And Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n  \n \n  \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n  \n \n  \"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome.

On\nthe third day, having covered half the distance to the Kumaji\nsettlement, they began to encounter Kumaji patrols, on foot or\n   \n   thlotback\n   \n  , the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the\nsands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding.\nSteve and Mary hardly spoke. Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond\ngrew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out\nhere with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her\nheart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in\norder to regain his fortune.\n  \n \n  On the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and\nmade their way toward it.

And then I was awake\u2014and the fire was still there, fiercely\nburning at me.\n  \n \n  I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain\nhit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the\nriver of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and\nconscious.\n  \n \n  I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to\nan unpadded acceleration couch\u2014the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm\ninstalls in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but\nno one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a\nlot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.\nI took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,\nbut the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the\ncracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....\n  \n \n  There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I\ntried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation\nthat transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with\nthe charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek\nup Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the\nmicroswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was\nfading out again....\n  \n<doc-sep>Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with\nterror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.\n  \n \n  \"Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies\nmeant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast.\nEven now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden\nidea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.\n  \n \n  \"You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now.\nIf we can just hold out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Roberts shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just\nbeen looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they\nfirst attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar's last hope flickered out.\n  \n \n  \"Then I\u2014I guess it won't be long now,\" he mourned. \"If we could have\nonly got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to\npick us up. But as it is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's the way it goes. We knew what we were risking when we\nvolunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth\na plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous\nstones-on-legs!\"\n  \n \n  Roberts said, \"That's right. But what are\n   \n   you\n   \n  doing out here, Isobar?\nAnd why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh\u2014the pipes?\" Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten\nhis original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten\nhis instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow\nthroughout all the excitement he had held onto it. \"Why, I just\nhappened to\u2014Oh!\n   \n   the pipes!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on!\" roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more,\nthe three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy\nrefuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts.\nThis time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several\nsnapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that\nthe \"lethal ray\" of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their\nadamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.\n  \n \n  Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture\nof enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating\nGrannies.\n  \n \n  \"No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of\nfighting those filthy things\u2014\"\n  \n \n  But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. \"The pipes!\" he cried again,\nexcitedly. \"That's the answer!\" And he drew the instrument into playing\nposition, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over\nhis shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath\nexpelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive,\nfearsome, \"\n   \n   Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Roberts moaned.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Lord! A guy can't even die in peace!\"\n  \n \n  And Brown stared at him hopelessly.\n  \n \n  \"It's no use, Isobar. You trying to scare them off? They have no sense\nof hearing. That's been proven\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Isobar took his lips from the reed to explain.\n  \n \n  \"It's not that. I'm trying to rouse the boys in the Dome. We're right\nopposite the atmosphere-conditioning-unit. See that grilled duct over\nthere? That's an inhalation-vent. The portable transmitter's out of\norder, and our voices ain't strong enough to carry into the Dome\u2014but\nthe sound of these pipes is! And Commander Eagan told me just a short\nwhile ago that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building!\n  \n \n  \"If they hear this, they'll get mad because I'm disobeyin' orders.\nThey'll start lookin' for me. If they can't find me inside, maybe\nthey'll look Outside. See that window? That's Sparks' turret. If we can\nmake him look out here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Stop talking!\n   \n  \" roared Roberts. \"Stop talking, guy, and start\nblowing! I think you've got something there. Anyhow, it's our last\nhope.\n   \n   Blow!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"And quick!\" appended Brown. \"For here they come!\"\n  \n \n \n \n   Isobar played, blew with all his might, while the Grannies raged below.\n   \n \n \n \n  He meant the Grannies. Again they were huddling for attack, once more,\na solid phalanx of indestructible, granite flesh, they were smashing\ndown upon the tree.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Haa-a-roong!\n   \n  \" blew Isobar Jones.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  And\u2014even he could not have foreseen the astounding results of\nhis piping! What happened next was as astonishing as it was\nincomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into\nwhatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into\naction\u2014the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!\n  \n \n  As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless,\nquestioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and\nvibrant droning!\n  \n \n  So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed,\nhis lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow\nlifted his paralysis.\n  \n \n  \"Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They\n   \n   like\n   \n  it! Keep playing, Jonesy!\nPlay, boy, like you never played before!\"\n  \n \n  And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the\n   \n   piobaireachd\n   \n  into\nwhich Isobar had instinctively swung, \"Music hath charms to soothe the\nsavage beast! Then we were wrong. They\n   \n   can\n   \n  hear, after all! See that?\nThey're lying down to listen\u2014like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!\nFor once in my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!\"\n  \n \n  Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack\nhad stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly,\nquietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the\ntree.\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it; the Grannies\n   \n   liked\n   \n  this music. Eyes\nraptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of\ngentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar\npaused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe\nwith redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.\n  \n \n  Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have\nbeen a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not\u2014and\nin two cases\n   \n   dared\n   \n  not\u2014allow him to stop playing. And to this\naudience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches,\nflings, dances\u2014the stirring\n   \n   Rhoderik Dhu\n   \n  and the lilting\n   \n   Lassies\nO'Skye\n   \n  , the mournful\n   \n   Coghiegh nha Shie\n   \n  whose keening is like the\nsound of a sobbing nation.\n  \n \n \n   The Cock o' the North\n   \n  , he played, and\n   \n   Mironton\n   \n  ...\n   \n   Wee Flow'r o'\nDee\n   \n  and\n   \n   MacArthur's March\n   \n  ...\n   \n   La Cucuracha\n   \n  and\u2014\n  \n \n  And his lungs were parched, his lips dry as swabs of cotton. Blood\npounded through his temples, throbbing in time to the drone of the\nchaunter, and a dark mist gathered before his eyes. He tore the\nblow-pipe from his lips, gasped,\n  \n \n  \"Keep playing!\" came the dim, distant howl of Johnny Brown. \"Just a few\nminutes longer, Jonesy! Relief is on the way. Sparks saw us from his\nturret window five minutes ago!\"\n  \n \n  And Isobar played on. How, or what, he did not know. The memory of\nthose next few minutes was never afterward clear in his mind. All he\nknew was that above the skirling drone of his pipes there came another\nsound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank,\nsent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.\n  \n \n  He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of\nencouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and\nget out of here! Watch the Grannies\u2014they'll be after us the minute\nIsobar stops playing!\"\n  \n \n  Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar\nvoice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's\nfingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:\n  \n \n  \"After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres\u2014\n   \n   those Grannies are\nstone dead\n   \n  !\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The arms were thin and grotesque below the massively distorted\nshoulders, but amazingly strong. Gwayne felt them wrench at him as his\nhands locked on the thick throat. A stench of alien flesh was in his\nnose as the thing fell backwards. Doc Barker had hit it seconds after\nthe captain's attack. Its head hit rocky ground with a dull, heavy\nsound, and it collapsed. Gwayne eased back slowly, but it made no\nfurther move, though it was still breathing.\n  \n \n  Another jeep had drawn up, and men were examining the cadets. Pinelli\nwas either laughing or crying, and Kaufman was trying to break free to\nkick at the monster. But neither had been harmed. The two were loaded\nonto a jeep while men helped Barker and Gwayne stow the bound monster\non another before heading back.\n  \n \n  \"No sign of skull fracture. My God, what a tough brute!\" Barker shook\nhis own head, as if feeling the shock of the monster's landing.\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" Gwayne told him. \"I want that thing to live\u2014and you're\ndetailed to save it and revive it. Find out if it can make sign\nlanguage or draw pictures. I want to know what happened to Hennessy\nand why that ship was buried against detection. This thing may be the\nanswer.\"\n  \n \n  Barker nodded grimly. \"I'll try, though I can't risk drugs on an alien\nmetabolism.\" He sucked in on the cigarette he'd dug out, then spat\nsickly. Smoke and this air made a foul combination. \"Bob, it still\nmakes no sense. We've scoured this planet by infra-red, and there was\nno sign of native villages or culture. We should have found some.\"\n  \n \n  \"Troglodytes, maybe,\" Gwayne guessed. \"Anyhow, send for me when you get\nanything. I've got to get this ship back to Earth. We're overstaying\nour time here already.\"\n  \n \n  The reports from the cadets were satisfactory enough. They'd been\npicked up and carried, but no harm had been done them. Now they were\nbusy being little heroes. Gwayne sentenced them to quarters as soon\nas he could, knowing their stories would only get wilder and less\ninformative with retelling.\n  \n \n  If they could get any story from the captured creature, they might save\ntime and be better off than trying to dig through Hennessy's ship. That\nwas almost certainly spoorless by now. The only possible answer seemed\nto be that the exploring expedition and Hennessy's rescue group had\nbeen overcome by the aliens.\n  \n \n  It was an answer, but it left a lot of questions. How could the\nprimitives have gotten to the men inside Hennessy's ship? Why was its\nfuel dumped? Only men would have known how to do that. And who told\nthese creatures that a space ship's metal finders could be fooled by a\nlittle more than a hundred feet of solid rock? They'd buried the ship\ncunningly, and only the accidental slippage had undone their work.\n  \n \n  Maybe there would never be a full answer, but he had to find\nsomething\u2014and find it fast. Earth needed every world she could make\nremotely habitable, or mankind was probably doomed to extinction.\n  \n"

Isobar jabbed the stud and answered\nwithout looking.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q.,\" he said wearily. \"O.Q. I told you it would be ready in a couple\no' minutes. Keep your pants on!\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014er\u2014I beg your pardon, Isobar?\" queried a mild voice.\n  \n \n  Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue. He\nblinked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  , Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather\nin Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\n  \n \n  South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\n  \n<doc-sep>For some twenty minutes, he raced through a dizzying, nightmare world\nof dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet.\n  \n \n  At last, abruptly, he realized that he was alone and in silence. He saw\nthat he was still on the rocketfront, but in the Tycho-ward side of the\ncity.\n  \n \n  He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette.\nA thousand stars\u2014a thousand motionless balls of silver fire\u2014shone\nabove him through Luna City's transparent dome.\n  \n \n  He was sorry he'd hit Cobb, of course. He was not sorry he'd run.\nEscaping at least gave him a power of choice, of decision.\n  \n \n \n   You can do two things\n   \n  , he thought.\n  \n \n \n   You can give yourself up, and that's what a good officer would do.\nThat would eliminate the escape charge. You'd get off with voluntary\nmanslaughter. Under interplanetary law, that would mean ten years in\nprison and a dishonorable discharge. And then you'd be free.\n   \n \n \n \n   But you'd be through with rockets and space. They don't want new\nmen over thirty-four for officers on rockets or even for third-class\njet-men on beat-up freighters\u2014they don't want convicted killers. You'd\nget the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by\npeeking through electric fences of spaceports.\n   \n \n \n \n   Or\u2014\n   \n \n \n  There were old wives' tales of a group of renegade spacemen who\noperated from the Solar System's frontiers. The spacemen weren't\noutlaws. They were misfits, rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth.\n  \n \n  And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars, the\nsouped-up renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids. Their\nheadquarters was Venus. Their leader\u2014a subject of popular and\nfantastic conjecture in the men's audiozines\u2014was rumored to be a\nred-bearded giant.\n  \n \n \n   So\n   \n  , Ben reflected,\n   \n   you can take a beer-and-pretzels tale seriously.\nYou can hide for a couple of days, get rid of your uniform, change your\nname. You can wait for a chance to get to Venus. To hell with your\nduty. You can try to stay in space, even if you exile yourself from\nEarth.\n   \n \n \n  After all, was it right for a single second, a single insignificant\nsecond, to destroy a man's life and his dream?\n  \n<doc-sep>It was a long mile, even at the pace human muscles could achieve on\nGanymede. They took one short rest, during which Tolliver was forced\nto explain away the dangers of slides and volcanic puffballs. He\nadmitted to having exaggerated slightly. In the end, they reached the\nspaceship.\n  \n \n  There seemed to be no one about. The landing dome had been collapsed\nand stored, and the ship's airlock port was closed.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right,\" Tolliver told the girl. \"We can get in with no\ntrouble.\"\n  \n \n  It was when he looked about to make sure that they were unobserved that\nhe caught a glimpse of motion back toward the city. He peered at the\nspot through the dim light. After a moment, he definitely recognized\nthe outline of a tractor breasting a rise in the ground and tilting\ndownward again.\n  \n \n  \"In fact, we\n   \n   have\n   \n  to get in to stay out of trouble,\" he said to Betty.\n  \n \n  He located the switch-cover in the hull, opened it and activated the\nmechanism that swung open the airlock and extended the ladder.\n  \n \n  It took him considerable scrambling to boost the girl up the ladder and\ninside, but he managed. They passed through the airlock, fretting at\nthe time required to seal, pump air and open the inner hatch; and then\nTolliver led the way up another ladder to the control room. It was a\nclumsy trip in their spacesuits, but he wanted to save time.\n  \n \n \n \n  In the control room, he shoved the girl into an acceleration seat,\nglanced at the gauges and showed her how to open her helmet.\n  \n \n  \"Leave the suit on,\" he ordered, getting in the first word while she\nwas still shaking her head. \"It will help a little on the takeoff.\"\n  \n \n  \"Takeoff!\" shrilled Betty. \"What do you think you're going to do? I\njust want to use the radio or TV!\"\n  \n \n  \"That tractor will get here in a minute or two. They might cut your\nconversation kind of short. Now shut up and let me look over these\ndials!\"\n  \n \n  He ran a practiced eye over the board, reading the condition of the\nship. It pleased him. Everything was ready for a takeoff into an\neconomy orbit for Earth. He busied himself making a few adjustments,\ndoing his best to ignore the protests from his partner in crime. He\nwarned her the trip might be long.\n  \n \n  \"I told you not to come,\" he said at last. \"Now sit back!\"\n  \n \n  He sat down and pushed a button to start the igniting process.\n  \n \n  In a moment, he could feel the rumble of the rockets through the deck,\nand then it was out of his hands for several minutes.\n  \n \n  \"That wasn't so bad,\" Betty admitted some time later. \"Did you go in\nthe right direction?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" retorted Tolliver. \"There wasn't time to check\n   \n   everything\n   \n  . We'll worry about that after we make your call.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\" Betty looked helpless. \"It's in my pocket.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver sighed. In their weightless state, it was no easy task to pry\nher out of the spacesuit. He thought of inquiring if she needed any\nfurther help, but reminded himself that this was the boss's daughter.\nWhen Betty produced a memo giving frequency and call sign, he set about\nmaking contact.\n  \n \n  It took only a few minutes, as if the channel had been monitored\nexpectantly, and the man who flickered into life on the screen wore a\nuniform.\n  \n \n  \"Space Patrol?\" whispered Tolliver incredulously.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" said Betty. \"Uh ... Daddy made arrangements for me.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver held her in front of the screen so she would not float out\nof range of the scanner and microphone. As she spoke, he stared\nexasperatedly at a bulkhead, marveling at the influence of a man who\ncould arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to Ganymede and\nwondering what was behind it all.\n  \n \n  When he heard Betty requesting assistance in arresting Jeffers and\nreporting the manager as the head of a ring of crooks, he began to\nsuspect. He also noticed certain peculiarities about the remarks of the\nPatrolman.\n  \n"

He\nblinked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, jumpin' jimminy!\" he gulped. \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  , Miss Sally! Golly\u2014'scuse me!\nI didn't realize\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Dome Commander's niece giggled.\n  \n \n  \"That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather\nin Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki,\nbut I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" promised Isobar. \"It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally.\nFine sunshiny weather. You can go.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's wonderful. Thanks so much, Isobar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mention it, ma'am,\" said Isobar, and returned to his work.\n  \n \n  South America. Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the\nmeteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his\njob. As he wrote forecasts for each area, in his mind's eye he saw\nhimself enjoying such pastimes as each geographical division's terrain\nrendered possible.\n  \n<doc-sep>If home is where the heart is, Horatio Jones\u2014known better as \"Isobar\"\nto his associates at the Experimental Dome on Luna\u2014was a long, long\nway from home. His lean, gangling frame was immured, and had been for\nsix tedious Earth months, beneath the\n   \n   impervite\n   \n  hemisphere of Lunar\nIII\u2014that frontier outpost which served as a rocket refueling station,\nteleradio transmission point and meteorological base.\n  \n \n  \"Six solid months! Six sad, dreary months!\" thought Isobar, \"Locked up\nin an airtight Dome like\u2014like a goldfish in a glass bowl!\" Sunlight?\nOh, sure! But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not\nburn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a\ntoad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented,\nreoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.\n  \n \n  Excitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he\nsigned on for frontier service? Bah! Only a weary, monotonous, routine\nexistence.\n  \n \n  \"A pain!\" declared Isobar Jones. \"That's what it is; a pain in the\nstummick. Not even allowed to\u2014Yeah?\"\n  \n \n  It was Sparks, audioing from the Dome's transmission turret. He said,\n\"Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?\"\n  \n \n  \"Done,\" said Isobar. \"I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. But just bring\n   \n   it\n   \n  . Nothing else.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar bridled.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know what you're talkin' about.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of\nyours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.\"\n  \n \n  Isobar said defiantly, \"It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I\nguess I can play it if I want to\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not,\" said Sparks emphatically, \"in\n   \n   my\n   \n  cubby! I've got sensitive\neardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling\nquick today. Big doings up here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah? What?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, it's Roberts and Brown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What about 'em?\"\n  \n \n  \"They've gone Outside to make foundation repairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lucky stiffs!\" commented Isobar ruefully.\n  \n \n  \"Lucky, no. Stiffs, maybe\u2014if they should meet any Grannies. Well,\nscoot along. I'm on the ether in four point sixteen minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Be right up,\" promised Isobar, and, sheets in hand, he ambled from his\ncloistered cell toward the central section of the Dome.\n  \n \n  He didn't leave Sparks' turret after the sheets were delivered.\nInstead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally\nturned to him in sheer exasperation.\n  \n \n  \"Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble? Bugs in your\nbritches?\"\n  \n \n  Isobar said, \"H-huh? Oh, you mean\u2014Oh, thanks, no! I just thought mebbe\nyou wouldn't mind if I\u2014well\u2014er\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I get it!\" Sparks grinned. \"Want to play peekaboo while the contact's\nopen, eh? Well, O.Q. Watch the birdie!\"\n  \n \n  He twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of\nincomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before\nhim cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating\nwith painstaking clarity:\n  \n \n  \"Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me,\nLuna? Can you hear\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"I can not only hear you,\" snorted Riley, \"I can see you and smell you,\nas well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!\"\n  \n \n  The now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of\ndispleasure.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, it's\n   \n   you\n   \n  ? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Riley agreeably. \"I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley,\nthe cosmic comedian\u2014didn't you know? Flick on your dictacoder,\noyster-puss; here's the weather report.\" He read it. \"'\n   \n   Weather\nforecast for Terra, week of May 15-21\n   \n  \u2014'\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him,\" whispered Isobar eagerly. \"Sparks, don't forget to ask him!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Wilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\n  \n \n  A flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\n  \n \n  Raptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\n  \n \n  How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\n  \n \n  It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\n  \n \n  He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\n  \n \n  And the shooting? That could only be\u2014\n  \n \n  He did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\n  \n \n  And behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Simultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n  \n \n  \"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n  \n \n  \"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\n   \n   alone\n   \n  ! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\n  \n \n  He was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\n   \n   not\n   \n  a climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\n  \n \n  Roberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n  \n \n  \"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\n  \n \n  For the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\n  \n \n  Desperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!\n  \n"

        "Steve gave him another drink. \"You still haven't told me what happened.\"\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\n  \n \n  \"When did it happen?\" Steve demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Last night.\" It was now midafternoon. \"Three folks died,\" the Kumaji\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \"from the poisoning of the well. The\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\" Oasis City,\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\n  \n \n  \"They have to,\" the old man said. \"And they have to hurry. Men, women\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>All night the thought crept\nthrough my brain like a teasing\nspider:\n   \n   What can we do to make\nhim stay? What can we tell him?\nWhat, what, what?\n   \n \n \n  Unable to sleep the next morning,\nI left John to his snoring and\nwent for an aspirin and black coffee.\nAll the possible schemes were\ndrumming through my mind: finding\nan Earth blonde to capture\nJohn's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,\nbreaking his leg, forging\na letter from this mythical university\ntelling him his theory was\nproved valid and for him to take\na nice long vacation now. He was\na screwball about holes and force\nfields and dimensional worlds but\nfor that music of his I'd baby him\nthe rest of his life.\n  \n \n  It was early afternoon when I\ntrudged back to my apartment.\n  \n \n  John was squatting on the living\nroom floor, surrounded by a forest\nof empty beer bottles. His eyes were\nbulging, his hair was even wilder\nthan usual, and he was swaying.\n  \n \n  \"John!\" I cried. \"You're drunk!\"\n  \n \n  His watery eyes squinted at me.\n\"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm\nawful scared!\"\n  \n \n  \"But you mustn't be scared. That\nreporter was just stupid. We'll help\nyou with your theory.\"\n  \n \n  His body trembled. \"No, it isn't\nthat.

You've just had too\nmuch beer, that's all. Let's go out\nand get some air and some strong\nblack coffee. C'mon now.\"\n  \n \n  We staggered out into the morning\ndarkness, the three of us. John,\nthe\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  , and I.\n  \n \n  I was hanging on to him trying\nto see around and over and even\nunder the\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  \u2014steering by a\nsort of radar-like sixth sense. The\nstreet lights on Marsport are pretty\ndim compared to Earthside. I\ndidn't see the open manhole that\nthe workmen had figured would be\nall right at that time of night.

Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\n   \n   Rhapsody of The\nStars\n   \n  . He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  \u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\n  \n \n  But after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\n  \n \n  John Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought again.\n  \n \n  Awhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\n  \n \n  He pointed.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n  \n \n  \"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\n  \n \n  It didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\n  \n \n  Conclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\n  \n \n  At intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\n  \n \n  His grunt was negative.\n  \n \n  \"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled. \"Yes, I\n   \n   like\n   \n  beer.\"\n  \n \n  I escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n  \n \n  \"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\n  \n \n  John yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\n  \n \n  He made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n  \n \n  \"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\n  \n \n  His watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\n  \n \n  He yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n  \n \n  \"What\n   \n   do\n   \n  you like to do, John?\"\n  \n \n  His string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\n  \n \n  Oh Lord, that plan again!\n  \n \n  I took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John. It\n   \n   must\n   \n  be interesting.\"\n  \n \n  He made queer clicking noises\nwith his mouth that reminded me\nof a mechanical toy being wound\ninto motion. \"The whole foundation\nof this or any other culture is\nbased on the history of all the time\ndimensions, each interwoven with\nthe other, throughout the ages.

Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n   \n \n \n  \"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls.

They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\n  \n \n  He glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\n  \n \n  He was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n  \n \n  \"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  to prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools.

Only I get so tired\njust thinking about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see where thinking\nabout it would tire any one.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded. \"But it can't be too\nfar away.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to hear more about it,\"\nI said. \"But if you're not going to\nplay with us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he\nbeamed. \"I can talk to\n   \n   you\n   \n  .\n   \n   You\n   \n  understand.\"\n  \n \n  Thank heaven!\n  \n"

It\ngets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M.\nof a Martian morning, and I\nguess the men were warming up\nwith a little nip at the bar across\nthe street.\n  \n \n  Then\u2014he was gone.\n  \n \n  John just slipped out of my grasp\u2014\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  and all\u2014and was gone\u2014completely\nand irrevocably gone.\nI even risked a broken neck and\njumped in the manhole after him.\nNothing\u2014nothing but the smell of\nozone and an echo bouncing crazily\noff the walls of the conduit.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\u2014is it.\"\n  \n \n  John Smith was gone, so utterly\nand completely and tragically gone\nit was as if he'd never existed....\n  \n<doc-sep>We played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\n   \n   Rhapsody of The\nStars\n   \n  . He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth.

Remember, you still\nhave to eat.\n   \n \n \n  \"Trouble is,\" he went on, \"there\nare so many holes in this universe.\"\n  \n \n  \"Holes?\" I kept a straight face.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. Look around you. All\nyou see is holes. These beer bottles\nare just holes surrounded by glass.\nThe doors and windows\u2014they're\nholes in walls. The mine tunnels\nmake a network of holes under the\ndesert. Caves are holes, animals live\nin holes, our faces have holes,\nclothes have holes\u2014millions and\nmillions of holes!\"\n  \n \n  I winced and thought, humor\nhim because you gotta eat, you\ngotta eat.\n  \n \n  His voice trembled with emotion.\n\"Why, they're everywhere. They're\nin pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket\njets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes\nand well holes, and shoelace\nholes. There are doughnut\nholes and stocking holes and woodpecker\nholes and cheese holes.\nOceans lie in holes in the earth,\nand rivers and canals and valleys.\nThe craters of the Moon are holes.\nEverything is\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"But, John,\" I said as patiently as\npossible, \"what have these holes\ngot to do with you?\"\n  \n \n  He glowered at me as if I were\nunworthy of such a confidence.\n\"What have they to do with me?\"\nhe shrilled. \"I can't find the right\none\u2014that's what!\"\n  \n \n  I closed my eyes. \"Which particular\nhole are you looking for, John?\"\n  \n \n  He was speaking rapidly again\nnow.\n  \n \n  \"I was hurrying back to the University\nwith the\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  to prove\na point of ancient history to those\nfools.

And if I don't get\nback they will think I couldn't prove\nmy theory, that I'm ashamed to\ncome back, and I'll be discredited.\"\n  \n \n  His chest sagged for an instant.\nThen he straightened. \"But there's\nstill time for my plan to work out\u2014with\nthe relative difference taken\ninto account. Only I get so tired\njust thinking about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see where thinking\nabout it would tire any one.\"\n  \n \n  He nodded. \"But it can't be too\nfar away.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to hear more about it,\"\nI said. \"But if you're not going to\nplay with us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'll play with you,\" he\nbeamed. \"I can talk to\n   \n   you\n   \n  .\n   \n   You\n   \n  understand.\"\n  \n \n  Thank heaven!\n  \n<doc-sep>The cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders\nand fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes\nand looked at her. \"I just don't understand,\" he said. \"It seemed\nobvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd\ndo it.\"\n  \n \n  Her pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he\nwas facing her. \"I've got to understand. I've got to know\n   \n   why\n   \n  . What\nhappened? Why don't men want the planets any more?\"\n  \n \n  \"Honestly,\" she said, \"I did not know they ever had.\" She hesitated.\n\"Maybe you are asking the wrong question.\"\n  \n \n  He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.\n  \n \n  \"I mean,\" she explained, \"maybe you should ask why people in the 20th\nCentury\n   \n   did\n   \n  want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland felt his face become hot. \"Men can go anywhere, if they want\nto bad enough.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\n   \n   why\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Despite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick\nto logic. \"Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to\nthe population problem....\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that\nthe key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic\nsystem was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we\nhave held the number at that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Birth control,\" Maitland scoffed. \"How do you make it work\u2014secret\npolice?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we\ncherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those\ntwo are the best children we could possibly produce....\"\n  \n \n  She broke off, looking a little self-conscious. \"You understand, what\nI have been saying applies to\n   \n   most\n   \n  of the world. In some places like\nAresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I\nbelong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Even,\" he said, \"granting that you have solved the population problem,\nthere's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must\nbe men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in\nyour blood, the idea of going to Mars\u2014just to go there and see what's\nthere and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested\nin finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of\nVenus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance\nof only two hundred thousand miles?\" His hands were trembling as he\nstopped.\n  \n \n  She shrugged her shapely shoulders. \"Go into the past\u2014yes! But go out\nthere? I still cannot see why.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has the spirit of adventure\n   \n   evaporated\n   \n  from the human race, or\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts\nkilled the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time\ntraveling is the greatest adventure there is. At least, that is the\nway I feel. Listen, Bob.\" She laid a hand on his arm. \"You grew up in\nthe Age of Technology. Everybody was terribly excited about what could\nbe done with machines\u2014machines to blow up a city all at once, or fly\naround the world, or take a man to Mars. We have had our fill of\u2014what\nis the word?\u2014gadgets. Our machines serve us, and so long as they\nfunction right, we are satisfied to forget about them.\n  \n \n  \"Because this is the Age of\n   \n   Man\n   \n  . We are terribly interested in what\ncan be done with people. Our scientists, like Swarts, are studying\nhuman rather than nuclear reactions. We are much more fascinated by the\nlife and death of cultures than by the expansion or contraction of the\nUniverse. With us, it is the people that are important, not gadgets.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland stared at her, his face blank. His mind had just manufactured\na discouraging analogy. His present position was like that of an\nearnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of nature into\nthe year 1950, trying to find a way of reanimating the anti-Mohammedan\nmovement. What chance would he have? The unfortunate knight would argue\nin vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the\ninfidel....\n  \n \n  Maitland looked up at the girl, who was regarding him silently with\ntroubled eyes. \"I think I'd like to be alone for a while,\" he said.\n  \n"

Goon-Face is scowling\nagain with the icy fury of a\nPlutonian monsoon. As Goon-Face\nhas said, \"No beeg feedle, no contract.\"\n  \n \n  Without John, we're notes in a\nlost chord.\n  \n \n  We've searched everything, in\nhospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs,\nhotels. We've hounded spaceports\nand 'copter terminals. Nowhere, nowhere\nis John Smith.\n  \n \n  Ziggy, whose two fingers have\nhealed, has already bowed to what\nseems inevitable. He's signed up for\nthat trip to Neptune's uranium\npits. There's plenty of room for\nmore volunteers, he tells us. But I\nspend my time cussing the guy who\nforgot to set the force field at the\nother end of the hole and let John\nand his\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  back into his own\ntime dimension. I cuss harder when\nI think how we were robbed of the\nbest bass player in the galaxy.\n  \n \n  And without a corpus delecti we\ncan't even sue the city.\n  \n \n \n   ... THE END\n   \n \n<doc-sep>Heaven lasted for just three\ndays. During those seventy-two\ngolden hours the melodious tinkling\nof The Eye's cash register was as\nconstant as that of Santa's sleigh\nbells.\n  \n \n  John became the hero of tourists,\nspacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless\nhe remained stubbornly\naloof. He was quiet, moody, playing\nhis\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  automatically. He'd\nreveal definite indications of belonging\nto Homo Sapiens only when\ndrinking beer and talking about his\nholes.\n  \n \n  Goon-Face was still cautious.\n  \n \n  \"Contract?\" he wheezed. \"Maybe.\nWe see. Eef feedleman stay, we\nhave contract. He stay, yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"He'll stay\u2014just\nas long as you want him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Den he sign contract, too. No\nbeeg feedle, no contract.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. We'll get him to sign it.\"\nI laughed hollowly. \"Don't worry,\nMr. Ke-teeli.\"\n  \n \n  Just a few minutes later tragedy\nstruck.\n  \n \n  A reporter from the\n   \n   Marsport\nTimes\n   \n  ambled into interview the\nMan of The Hour. The interview,\nunfortunately, was conducted over\nthe bar and accompanied by a generous\nguzzling of beer. Fat Boy,\nHammer-Head and I watched\nfrom a table. Knowing John as we\ndid, a silent prayer was in our eyes.\n  \n \n  \"This is the first time he's talked\nto anybody,\" Fat Boy breathed.\n\"I\u2014I'm scared.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing can happen,\" I said,\noptimistically. \"This'll be good publicity.\"\n  \n \n  We watched.\n  \n \n  John murmured something. The\nreporter, a paunchy, balding man,\nscribbled furiously in his notebook.\n  \n \n  John yawned, muttered something\nelse. The reporter continued\nto scribble.\n  \n \n  John sipped beer. His eyes\nbrightened, and he began to talk\nmore rapidly.\n  \n \n  The reporter frowned, stopped\nwriting, and studied John curiously.\n  \n \n  John finished his first beer,\nstarted on his second. His eyes were\nwild, and he was talking more and\nmore rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"He's doing it,\" Hammer-Head\ngroaned. \"He's telling him!\"\n  \n \n  I rose swiftly. \"We better get\nover there. We should have known\nbetter\u2014\"\n  \n \n  We were too late. The reporter\nhad already slapped on his hat and\nwas striding to the exit. John turned\nto us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing\nlike air from a punctured balloon.\n  \n \n  \"He wouldn't listen,\" he said,\nweakly. \"I tried to tell him, but he\nsaid he'd come back when I'm\nsober. I'm sober now. So I quit.\nI've got to find my hole.\"\n  \n \n  I patted him on the back. \"No,\nJohn, we'll help you. Don't quit.\nWe'll\u2014well, we'll help you.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're working on a plan, too,\"\nsaid Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.\n\"We're going to make a more\nscientific approach.\"\n  \n \n  \"How?\" John asked.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy gulped.\n  \n \n  \"Just wait another day,\" I said.\n\"We'll have it worked out. Just be\npatient another day. You can't\nleave now, not after all your work.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I guess not,\" he sighed. \"I'll\nstay\u2014until tomorrow.\"\n  \n"

        "We played. Tune after tune.\nJohn knew them all, from the\nlatest pop melodies to a swing version\nof the classic\n   \n   Rhapsody of The\nStars\n   \n  . He was a quiet guy during\nthe next couple of hours, and getting\nmore than a few words from\nhim seemed as hard as extracting a\ntooth. He'd stand by his fiddle\u2014I\nmean, his\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  \u2014with a dreamy\nexpression in those watery eyes,\nstaring at nothing.\n  \n \n  But after one number he studied\nFat Boy's clarinet for a moment.\n\"Nice clarinet,\" he mused. \"Has an\nunusual hole in the front.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy scratched the back of\nhis head. \"You\u2014you mean here?\nWhere the music comes out?\"\n  \n \n  John Smith nodded. \"Unusual.\"\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought again.\n  \n \n  Awhile later I caught him eyeing\nmy piano keyboard. \"What's\nthe matter, John?\"\n  \n \n  He pointed.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, there,\" I said. \"A cigarette\nfell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole\nin the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll\nswear at me in seven languages.\"\n  \n \n  \"Even there,\" he said softly,\n\"even there....\"\n  \n \n  There was no doubt about it.\nJohn Smith was peculiar, but he\nwas the best bass man this side of a\nmusician's Nirvana.\n  \n \n  It didn't take a genius to figure\nout our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's\ncountenance had evidenced\nan excellent imitation of Mephistopheles\nbefore John began to play.\nItem two: Goon-Face had beamed\nlike a kitten with a quart of cream\nafter John began to play.\n  \n \n  Conclusion: If we wanted to\nkeep eating, we'd have to persuade\nJohn Smith to join our combo.\n  \n \n  At intermission I said, \"How\nabout a drink, John? Maybe a shot\nof wine-syrup?\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?\"\n  \n \n  His grunt was negative.\n  \n \n  \"Then some old-fashioned beer?\"\n  \n \n  He smiled. \"Yes, I\n   \n   like\n   \n  beer.\"\n  \n \n  I escorted him to the bar and assisted\nhim in his arduous climb onto\na stool.\n  \n \n  \"John,\" I ventured after he'd\ntaken an experimental sip, \"where\nhave you been hiding? A guy like\nyou should be playing every night.\"\n  \n \n  John yawned. \"Just got here. Figured\nI might need some money so\nI went to the union. Then I worked\non my plan.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you need a job. How\nabout playing with us steady? We\nlike your style a lot.\"\n  \n \n  He made a long, low humming\nsound which I interpreted as an\nexpression of intense concentration.\n\"I don't know,\" he finally drawled.\n  \n \n  \"It'd be a steady job, John.\" Inspiration\nstruck me. \"And listen, I\nhave an apartment. It's got everything,\nsolar shower, automatic chef,\n'copter landing\u2014if we ever get a\n'copter. Plenty of room there for\ntwo people. You can stay with me\nand it won't cost you a cent. And\nwe'll even pay you over union\nwages.\"\n  \n \n  His watery gaze wandered lazily\nto the bar mirror, down to the glittering\narray of bottles and then out\nto the dance floor.\n  \n \n  He yawned again and spoke\nslowly, as if each word were a leaden\nweight cast reluctantly from his\ntongue:\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't ... care much ...\nabout playing.\"\n  \n \n  \"What\n   \n   do\n   \n  you like to do, John?\"\n  \n \n  His string-bean of a body stiffened.\n\"I like to study ancient history ...\nand I must work on my\nplan.\"\n  \n \n  Oh Lord, that plan again!\n  \n \n  I took a deep breath. \"Tell me\nabout it, John.

Suddenly,\nsweeping across the dance\nfloor like a cold wind, was a bass\nfiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,\na refugee from a pawnbroker's\nattic. It was queerly shaped. It was\ntoo tall, too wide. It was more like\na monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass\nthan a bass.\n  \n \n  The fiddle was not unaccompanied\nas I'd first imagined. Behind\nit, streaking over the floor in a\nwaltz of agony, was a little guy, an\nanimated matchstick with a flat,\nbroad face that seemed to have\nbeen compressed in a vice. His sandcolored\nmop of hair reminded me\nof a field of dry grass, the long\nstrands forming loops that flanked\nthe sides of his face.\n  \n \n  His pale blue eyes were watery,\nlike twin pools of fog. His tightfitting\nsuit, as black as the bass,\nwas something off a park bench. It\nwas impossible to guess his age. He\ncould have been anywhere between\ntwenty and forty.\n  \n \n  The bass thumped down upon\nthe bandstand.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" he puffed. \"I'm John\nSmith, from the Marsport union.\"\nHe spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if\nanxious to conclude the routine of\nintroductions. \"I'm sorry I'm late,\nbut I was working on my plan.\"\n  \n \n  A moment's silence.\n  \n \n  \"Your plan?\" I echoed at last.\n  \n \n  \"How to get back home,\" he\nsnapped as if I should have known\nit already.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought.\n  \n \n  My gaze turned to the dance\nfloor. Goon-Face had his eyes on\nus, and they were as cold as six Indians\ngoing South.\n  \n \n  \"We'll talk about your plan at\nintermission,\" I said, shivering.\n\"Now, we'd better start playing.\nJohn, do you know\n   \n   On An Asteroid\nWith You\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know\n   \n   everything\n   \n  ,\" said John\nSmith.\n  \n \n  I turned to my piano with a\nshudder. I didn't dare look at that\nhorrible fiddle again. I didn't dare\nthink what kind of soul-chilling\ntones might emerge from its ancient\ndepths.\n  \n \n  And I didn't dare look again at\nthe second monstrosity, the one\nnamed John Smith. I closed my\neyes and plunged into a four-bar\nintro.\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head joined in on\nvibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,\nand then\u2014\n  \n \n  My eyes burst open. A shiver\ncoursed down my spine like gigantic\nmice feet.\n  \n \n  The tones that surged from that\nmonstrous bass were ecstatic. They\nwere out of a jazzman's Heaven.\nThey were great rolling clouds that\nseemed to envelop the entire universe\nwith their vibrance. They\nheld a depth and a volume and a\nrichness that were astounding, that\nwere like no others I'd ever heard.\n  \n \n  First they went\n   \n   Boom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom\n   \n  ,\nand then,\n   \n   boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom\n   \n  ,\njust like the tones of all bass\nfiddles.\n  \n \n  But there was something else, too.\nThere were overtones, so that John\nwasn't just playing a single note,\nbut a whole chord with each beat.\nAnd the fullness, the depth of those\nincredible chords actually set my\nblood tingling. I could\n   \n   feel\n   \n  the\ntingling just as one can feel the vibration\nof a plucked guitar string.\n  \n \n  I glanced at the cash customers.\nThey looked like weary warriors\ngetting their first glimpse of Valhalla.\nGap-jawed and wide-eyed,\nthey seemed in a kind of ecstatic\nhypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced\nMartians stopped sipping\ntheir wine-syrup and nodded their\ndark heads in time with the rhythm.\n  \n \n  I looked at The Eye. The transformation\nof his gaunt features\nwas miraculous. Shadows of gloom\ndissolved and were replaced by\na black-toothed, crescent-shaped\nsmile of delight. His eyes shone like\nthose of a kid seeing Santa Claus.\n  \n \n  We finished\n   \n   On An Asteroid With\nYou\n   \n  , modulated into\n   \n   Sweet Sally\nfrom Saturn\n   \n  and finished with\n   \n   Tighten Your Lips on Titan\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  We waited for the applause of\nthe Earth people and the shrilling\nof the Martians to die down. Then\nI turned to John and his fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"If I didn't hear it,\" I gasped,\n\"I wouldn't believe it!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the fiddle's so old, too!\"\nadded Hammer-Head who, although\nsober, seemed quite drunk.\n  \n \n  \"Old?\" said John Smith. \"Of\ncourse it's old. It's over five thousand\nyears old. I was lucky to find\nit in a pawnshop. Only it's not a\nfiddle but a\n   \n   Zloomph\n   \n  . This is the\nonly one in existence.\" He patted\nthe thing tenderly. \"I tried the hole\nin it but it isn't the right one.\"\n  \n \n  I wondered what the hell he was\ntalking about. I studied the black,\nmirror-like wood. The aperture in\nthe vesonator was like that of any\nbass fiddle.\n  \n \n  \"Isn't right for what?\" I had to\nask.\n  \n \n  He turned his sad eyes to me.\n\"For going home,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Hummm, I thought.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n \n \n \n   He was something out of a nightmare but his music was straight\nfrom heaven.

You might find it just on the other side\nof the fence\u2014where the grass is always greener.\n   \n \n \n \n  The Ship dove into Earth's sea of atmosphere like a great, silver\nfish.\n  \n \n  Inside the ship, a man and woman stood looking down at the expanse of\nland that curved away to a growing horizon. They saw the yellow ground\ncracked like a dried skin; and the polished stone of the mountains and\nthe seas that were shrunken away in the dust. And they saw how the\ncity circled the sea, as a circle of men surround a water hole in a\ndesert under a blazing sun.\n  \n \n  The ship's radio cried out. \"You've made it! Thank God! You've made\nit!\"\n  \n \n  Another voice, shaking, said, \"President\u2014Davis is\u2014overwhelmed. He\ncan't go on. On his behalf and on behalf of all the people\u2014with our\nhope that was almost dead, we greet you.\" A pause. \"Please come in!\"\n  \n \n  The voice was silent. The air screamed against the hull of the ship.\n  \n \n  \"I can't tell them,\" said the man.\n  \n \n  \"Please come in!\" said the radio. \"Do you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  The woman looked up at the man. \"You've got to Michael!\"\n  \n \n  \"Two thousand years. From one end of the galaxy to the other. Not one\ngrain of dust we can live on. Just Earth. And it's burned to a\ncinder.\"\n  \n \n  A note of hysteria stabbed into the radio voice. \"Are you all right?\nStand by! We're sending a rescue ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"They've got a right to know what we've found,\" said the woman. \"They\nsent us out. They've waited so long\u2014.\"\n  \n \n  He stared into space. \"It's hopeless. If we'd found another planet\nthey could live on, they'd do the same as they've done here.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the tiny golden locket that hung around his neck. \"Right\nnow, I could press this and scratch myself and the whole farce would\nbe over.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. A thousand of us died. You've got to think of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll go back out into space,\" he said. \"It's clean out there. I'm\ntired. Two thousand years of reincarnation.\"\n  \n \n  She spoke softly. \"We've been together for a long time. I've loved\nyou. I've asked very little. But I need to stay on Earth. Please,\nMichael.\"\n  \n \n  He looked at her for a moment. Then he flipped a switch. \"Milky Way to\nEarth. Never mind the rescue ship. We're all right. We're coming in.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ... THE END\n  \n \n"

        "In their rooms, Michael and Mary were talking through the hours, and\nwaiting. All around them were fragile, form-fitting chairs and\ntranslucent walls and a ceiling that, holding the light of the sun\nwhen they had first seen it, was now filled with moonlight.\n  \n \n  Standing at a circular window, ten feet in diameter, Michael saw, far\nbelow, the lights of the city extending into the darkness along the\nshoreline of the sea.\n  \n \n  \"We should have delivered our message by radio,\" he said, \"and gone\nback into space.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could probably still go,\" she said quietly.\n  \n \n  He came and stood beside her. \"I couldn't stand being out in space, or\nanywhere, without you.\"\n  \n \n  She looked up at him. \"We could go out into the wilderness, Michael,\noutside the force walls. We could go far away.\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her. \"It's all dead. What would be the use?\"\n  \n \n  \"I came from the Earth,\" she said quietly. \"And I've got to go back to\nit. Space is so cold and frightening. Steel walls and blackness and\nthe rockets and the little pinpoints of light. It's a prison.\"\n  \n \n  \"But to die out there in the desert, in that dust.\" Then he paused and\nlooked away from her. \"We're crazy\u2014talking as though we had a\nchoice.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe they'll have to\n   \n   give\n   \n  us a choice.\"\n  \n \n  \"What're you talking about?\"\n  \n \n  \"They went into hysterics at the sight of those bodies in the picture.\nThose young bodies that didn't die of old age.\"\n  \n \n  He waited.\n  \n \n  \"They can't stand the sight of people dying violently.\"\n  \n \n  Her hand went to her throat and touched the tiny locket.\n  \n \n  \"These lockets were given to us so we'd have a choice between\nsuffering or quick painless death.... We still have a choice.\"\n  \n \n  He touched the locket at his own throat and was very still for a long\nmoment. \"So we threaten to kill ourselves, before their eyes. What\nwould it do to them?\"\n  \n \n  He was still for a long time. \"Sometimes, Mary, I think I don't know\nyou at all.\" A pause. \"And so now you and I are back where we started.\nWhich'll it be, space or Earth?\"\n  \n \n  \"Michael.\" Her voice trembled. \"I\u2014I don't know how to say this.\"\n  \n \n  He waited, frowning, watching her intently.\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014going to have a child.\"\n  \n \n  His face went blank.\n  \n \n  Then he stepped forward and took her by the shoulders. He saw the\nsoftness there in her face; saw her eyes bright as though the sun were\nshining in them; saw a flush in her cheeks, as though she had been\nrunning. And suddenly his throat was full.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said thickly. \"I can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true.\"\n  \n \n  He held her for a long time, then he turned his eyes aside.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I can see it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I can't put into words why I let it happen, Michael.\"\n  \n \n  He shook his head. \"I don't know\u2014what to\u2014to say. It's so\nincredible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe\u2014I got so\u2014tired\u2014just seeing the two of us over and over again\nand the culturing of the scar tissue, for twenty centuries. Maybe that\nwas it. It was just\u2014something I felt I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to do. Some\u2014\n   \n   real\n   \n  life\nagain. Something new. I felt a need to produce something out of\nmyself. It all started way out in space, while we were getting close\nto the solar system. I began to wonder if we'd ever get out of the\nship alive or if we'd ever see a sunset again or a dawn or the night\nor morning like we'd seen on Earth\u2014so\u2014so long ago. And then I\n   \n   had\n   \n  to let it happen. It was a vague and strange thing. There was\nsomething forcing me. But at the same time I wanted it, too. I seemed\nto be willing it, seemed to be feeling it was a necessary thing.\" She\npaused, frowning. \"I didn't stop to think\u2014it would be like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Such a thing,\" he said, smiling grimly, \"hasn't happened on Earth for\nthree thousand years. I can remember in school, reading in the history\nbooks, how the whole Earth was overcrowded and how the food and water\nhad to be rationed and then how the laws were passed forbidding birth\nand after that how the people died and there weren't any more babies\nborn, until at last there was plenty of what the Earth had to give,\nfor everyone. And then the news was broken to everyone about the\nculturing of the scar tissue, and there were a few dissenters but they\nwere soon conditioned out of their dissension and the population was\nstabilized.\" He paused. \"After all this past history, I don't think\nthe council could endure what you've done.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" she said quietly. \"I don't think they could.\"\n  \n \n  \"And so this will be just for\n   \n   us\n   \n  .\" He took her in his arms. \"If I\nremember rightly, this is a traditional action.\" A pause. \"Now I'll go\nwith you out onto the Earth\u2014if we can swing it. When we get outside\nthe city, or if we do\u2014Well, we'll see.\"\n  \n \n  They were very still together and then he turned and stood by the\nwindow and looked down upon the city and she came and stood beside\nhim.\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n<doc-sep>Again they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\n  \n \n  The pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\n  \n \n  The President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n  \n \n  \"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  heroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\n  \n \n  He paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Proceed.\"\n  \n \n  Michael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\n  \n \n  The President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n  \n \n  \"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n  \n \n  \"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\n   \n   born\n   \n  and haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\n  \n \n  The President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\n  \n \n  Now they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\n  \n \n  Michael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n  \n \n  \"Stop!\" he said quietly.\n  \n \n  They halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n  \n \n  \"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  The faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n  \n \n  \"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n  \n \n  \"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\n  \n \n  The President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\n  \n \n  Michael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\n  \n \n  The half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\n   \n   Let\n   \n  them be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\n  \n \n  There was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\n  \n \n  Haltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\n   \n   will\n   \n  die. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n  \n \n  \"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n  \n \n  \"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n  \n \n  \"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\n  \n"

What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n  \n \n  \"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n  \n \n  \"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\n  \n \n  The President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\n  \n \n  Michael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\n  \n \n  The half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\n   \n   Let\n   \n  them be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\n  \n \n  There was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\n  \n \n  Haltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\n   \n   will\n   \n  die. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n  \n \n  \"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n  \n \n  \"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n  \n \n  \"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ... THE END\n  \n \n"

        "Michael and Mary, both staring, saw, along the line of desks, the\nagonized faces, some staring like white stones, others hidden in\nclutching fingers, as though they had been confronted by a Medusa.\nThere was the sound of heavy breathing that mixed with the throbbing\nof the pumps. The President held tightly to the edges of his desk to\nquiet his trembling.\n  \n \n  \"There\u2014there've been changes,\" he said, \"since you've been out in\nspace. There isn't a person on Earth who's seen a violent death for\nhundreds of years.\"\n  \n \n  Michael faced him, frowning. \"I don't follow you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dying violently happened so seldom on Earth that, after a long time,\nthe sight of it began to drive some people mad. And then one day a man\nwas struck by one of the ground cars and\n   \n   everyone\n   \n  who saw it went\ninsane. Since then we've eliminated accidents, even the idea. Now, no\none is aware that death by violence is even a possibility.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry,\" said Michael, \"we've been so close to violent death for\nso long.... What you've seen is part of the proof you asked for.\"\n  \n \n  \"What you showed us was a picture,\" said the President. \"If it had\nbeen real, we'd all be insane by now. If it were shown to the people\nthere'd be mass hysteria.\"\n  \n \n  \"But even if we'd found another habitable planet, getting to it would\ninvolve just what we've shown you. Maybe only a tenth of the people\nwho left Earth, or a hundredth, would ever reach a destination out in\nspace.\"\n  \n \n  \"We couldn't tolerate such a possibility,\" said the President\ngravely. \"We'd have to find a way around it.\"\n  \n \n  The pumps throbbed like giant hearts all through the stillness in the\ncouncil chambers. The faces along the line of desks were smoothing\nout; the terror in them was fading away.\n  \n \n  \"And yet the Earth is almost dead,\" said Michael quietly, \"and you\ncan't bring it back to life.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sins of our past, Mr. Nelson,\" said the President. \"The Atomic\nwars five thousand years ago. And the greed. It was too late a long\ntime ago. That, of course, is why the expedition was sent out. And now\nyou've come back to us with this terrible news.\" He looked around,\nslowly, then back to Michael. \"Can you give us any hope at all?\"\n  \n \n  \"None.\"\n  \n \n  \"Another expedition? To Andromeda perhaps? With you the leader?\"\n  \n \n  Michael shook his head. \"We're finished with expeditions, Mr.\nPresident.\"\n  \n \n  There were mutterings in the council, and hastily whispered\nconsultations. Now they were watching the man and woman again.\n  \n \n  \"We feel,\" said the President, \"it would be dangerous to allow you to\ngo out among the people. They've been informed that your statement\nwasn't entirely true. This was necessary, to avoid a panic. The people\nsimply must not know the whole truth.\" He paused. \"Now we ask you to\nkeep in mind that whatever we decide about the two of you will be for\nthe good of the people.\"\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary were silent.\n  \n \n  \"You'll wait outside the council chambers,\" the President went on,\n\"until we have reached our decision.\"\n  \n \n  As the man and woman were led away, the pumps beat in the stillness,\nand at the edge of the shrinking seas the salt thick waters were being\npulled into the distilleries, and from them into the tier upon tier of\nartificial gardens that sat like giant bee hives all around the\nshoreline; and the mounds of salt glistening in the sunlight behind\nthe gardens were growing into mountains.\n  \n<doc-sep>Again they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\n  \n \n  The pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\n  \n \n  The President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n  \n \n  \"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  heroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\n  \n \n  He paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Proceed.\"\n  \n \n  Michael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\n  \n \n  The President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n  \n \n  \"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n  \n \n  \"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\n   \n   born\n   \n  and haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\n  \n \n  The President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\n  \n \n  Now they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\n  \n \n  Michael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n  \n \n  \"Stop!\" he said quietly.\n  \n \n  They halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n  \n \n  \"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  The faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n  \n \n  \"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets!

A thin little man with bald head and frameless glasses was there,\nputting on a white coat. His veiny hands shook. He looked a hundred\nyears old. \"Where's Petey?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Pete's all right, Dad. Just leading a horse back to Burr's farm.\"\n  \n \n  The old man sighed. \"I didn't know what form it would take. I expected\none or two cases, but I couldn't predict whether it would be gradual or\nsudden, whether or not it would lead to violence.\"\n  \n \n  \"No violence, Dad.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, Stan.\" He looked at Harry. \"I'm going to give you a little\ntreatment, Mr. Burr. It'll settle your nerves and make everything....\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to Davie?\" Harry asked, things pushing at his brain\nagain.\n  \n \n  Stan helped him up. \"Just step this way, Mr. Burr.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't resist. He went through the second door into the room with\nthe big chair. He sat down and let them strap his arms and legs and let\nthem lower the metal thing over his head. He felt needles pierce his\nscalp and the back of his neck. He let them do what they wanted; he\nwould let them kill him if they wanted. All he asked was one answer so\nas to know whether or not he was insane.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to my son Davie?\"\n  \n \n  The old man walked across the room and examined what looked like the\ninsides of a dozen big radios. He turned, his hand on a switch.\n  \n \n  \"Please,\" Harry whispered. \"Just tell me about my son.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor blinked behind his glasses, and then his hand left the\nswitch. \"Dead,\" he said, his voice a rustling of dried leaves. \"Like so\nmany millions of others. Dead, when the bombs fell. Dead, as everyone\nknew they would be and no one did anything to prevent. Dead. Perhaps\nthe whole world is dead\u2014except for us.\"\n  \n \n  Harry stared at him.\n  \n"

        "They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n<doc-sep>As the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank came\nup out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and\ncoat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were\nthere, hurrying home to dinner.\n  \n \n  \"Good night,\" the guard said, locking the door after him.\n  \n \n  \"Good night,\" Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street\ntoward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the\nvault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there\nwas room for another tier. He was glad to be finished.\n  \n \n  At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The\nstreet was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around\u2014and froze.\n  \n \n  From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large\nand shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind.\n  \n \n  What the hell was it?\n  \n \n  Mason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and\nhungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner\ntable. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous\nand ugly. The light was bad; he couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew\nhim on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made\nhim uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened\u2014and fascinated.\n  \n \n  And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.\n  \n<doc-sep>Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel\nsuite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as\nhe watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again\nthat night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a\ncoin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,\nreserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to\nthe letter combination\n   \n   bodyguard\n   \n  , he went out into the street.\n  \n \n  If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have\nbeen nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real\nidentification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for\nyears.\n  \n \n  The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. \"Where to, fellow-man?\"\nthe driver asked.\n  \n \n  \"I'm new in the parish,\" the other man replied and let it hang there.\n  \n \n  \"Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?\"\n  \n \n  But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"Games?\" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was\nwanted by then. \"Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there a good zarquil game in town?\"\n  \n \n  The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the\nteleview. A very ordinary face. \"Look, colleague, why don't you commit\nsuicide? It's cleaner and quicker.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't contact your attitude,\" the passenger said with a thin\nsmile. \"Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it\nhappens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a\nthrill-mill.\" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and\nwhich the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?\" The driver spat out of the\nwindow. \"If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the\ncab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...\nanybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a\ncommission, wouldn't it?\" the other man asked coolly.\n  \n \n  \"Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're the dictator,\" the driver agreed sullenly.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no\ncondition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.\n  \n \n  \"Let me take the controls, honey,\" the light-haired girl urged, but he\nshook his handsome head.\n  \n \n  \"Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,\" he said thickly,\nreferring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,\nand of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.\n  \n \n  Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that\nwhen they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little\ntown, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed\non the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a\nshort fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.\n  \n \n  To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto\nthe dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the\nyoung man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there\nat all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to\nremember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment\nbefore the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.\n  \n \n  Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him\nspeculatively. \"My guardian angel,\" he mumbled\u2014shock had sobered him\na little, but not enough. He sat up. \"Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have\nthrown me back in.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's no joke,\" the fat man agreed.\n  \n \n  The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall\nthat he had not been alone. \"How about Helen? She on course?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seems to be,\" the fat man said. \"You all right, miss?\" he asked,\nglancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mrs.\n   \n  ,\" Gabriel corrected. \"Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel\nLockard,\" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.\n\"Pretty bauble, isn't she?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,\" the fat man said,\nlooking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up\nfrom her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. \"I hope\nyou'll be worthy of the name.\" The light given off by the flaming\ncar flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.\nOtherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.\n  \n \n  There were no public illuminators this far out\u2014even in town the\nlights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the\nnewer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and\nbeginning to slide downhill....\n  \n \n  Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.\n  \n"

There was a large four-color\npicture on the lid showing men, women and children moving through a\nbusy city street.

They called it that because the touch\nof certain kings was supposed to cure it ... and other diseases, too, I\nguess.\"\n  \n \n  She nodded. \"Certain people must have had the healing power and that's\nprobably why they originally got to be the rulers.\"\n  \n \n  In a very short time, I became a pretty important person. All the other\ndeficients in the world were tested for the healing power and all of\nthem turned out negative. I proved to be the only human healer alive,\nand not only that, I could work a thousand times more efficiently and\neffectively than any of the machines. The government built a hospital\njust for my work! Wounded people were ferried there from all over the\nworld and I cured them. I could do practically everything except raise\nthe dead and sometimes I wondered whether, with a little practice, I\nwouldn't be able to do even that.\n  \n \n  When I came to my new office, whom did I find waiting there for me but\nLucy, her trim figure enhanced by a snug blue and white uniform. \"I'm\nyour assistant, Kev,\" she said shyly.\n  \n \n  I looked at her. \"You are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014I hope you want me,\" she went on, coyness now mixing with\napprehension.\n  \n \n  I gave her shoulder a squeeze. \"I do want you, Lucy. More than I can\ntell you now. After all this is over, there's something more I want to\nsay. But right now\u2014\" I clapped her arm\u2014\"there's a job to be done.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Kevin,\" she said, glaring at me for some reason I didn't have\ntime to investigate or interpret at the moment. My patients were\nwaiting for me.\n  \n \n  They gave me everything else I could possibly need, except enough\nsleep, and I myself didn't want that. I wanted to heal. I wanted to\nshow my fellow human beings that, though I couldn't receive or transmit\nthoughts or foretell the future or move things with my mind, all those\npowers were useless without life, and that was what I could give.\n  \n \n  I took pride in my work. It was good to stop pain and ugliness, to know\nthat, if it weren't for me, these people would be dead or permanently\ndisfigured. In a sense, they were\u2014well, my children; I felt a warm\nglow of affection toward them.\n  \n \n  They felt the same way toward me. I knew because the secret of the\nhospital soon leaked out\u2014during all those years of peace, the\ngovernment had lost whatever facility it had for keeping secrets\u2014and\npeople used to come in droves, hoping for a glimpse of me.\n  \n<doc-sep>The blow shook the gun from my fingers. It almost fell into the\n   \n   thing\n   \n  on the floor, but at the last moment seemed to change direction and\nmiss it.\n  \n \n  I knew something. \"I don't wash because I drink coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's all right to drink coffee, isn't it?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" I said, and added absurdly, \"That's why I don't wash.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean,\" Andre said slowly, ploddingly, \"that if you bathed, you\nwould be admitting that drinking coffee was in the same class as any\nother solitary vice that makes people wash frequently.\"\n  \n \n  I was knocked to my knees.\n  \n \n  \"Kevin,\" the Martian said, \"drinking coffee represents a major vice\nonly in Centurian humanoids, not Earth-norm human beings.\n   \n   Which are\nyou?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Nothing came out of my gabbling mouth.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   What is Doc's full name?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  I almost fell in, but at the last instant I caught myself and said,\n\"Doctor Kevin O'Malley, Senior.\"\n  \n \n  From the bed, Doc said a word. \"Son.\"\n  \n \n  Then he disappeared.\n  \n \n  I looked at that which he had made. I wondered where he had gone, in\nsearch of what.\n  \n \n  \"He didn't use that,\" Andre said.\n  \n \n  So I was an Earthman, Doc's son. So my addiction to coffee was all in\nmy mind. That didn't change anything. They say sex is all in your mind.\nI didn't want to be cured. I wouldn't be. Doc was gone. That was all I\nhad now. That and the\n   \n   thing\n   \n  he left.\n  \n \n  \"The rest is simple,\" Andre said. \"Doc O'Malley bought up all the stock\nin a certain ancient metaphysical order and started supplying members\nwith certain books. Can you imagine the effect of the\n   \n   Book of Dyzan\n   \n  or the\n   \n   Book of Thoth\n   \n  or the\n   \n   Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan\n   \n  or the\n   \n   Necronomican\n   \n  itself on human beings?\"\n  \n \n  \"But they don't exist,\" I said wearily.\n  \n \n  \"Exactly, Kevin, exactly.

He could as easily\nhave walked downstairs as teleported, but I belonged to a family of\nexhibitionists. And Father tended to show off as if he were still a\nkid.

The tablecloth spread itself out\non the table. \"Wrinkles,\" he grumbled to himself. \"Wrinkles. And I had\nit so nice and smooth before. Mother will be furious.\"\n  \n \n  \"If she were going to be furious, she'd be furious already,\" Father\nreminded him sadly. It must be tough to be married to a deep-probe\ntelepath, I thought, and I felt a sudden wave of sympathy for him. It\nwas so seldom I got the chance to feel sorry for anyone except myself.\n\"But I think you'll find she understands.\"\n  \n \n  \"She knows, all right,\" Danny remarked as he went on into the kitchen,\n\"but I'm not sure she always understands.\"\n  \n \n  I was surprised to find him so perceptive on the abstract level,\nbecause he wasn't what you might call an understanding person, either.\n  \n<doc-sep>Breakfast was finally over and the rest of my family dispersed to their\nvarious jobs. Father simply took his briefcase and disappeared\u2014he was\na traveling salesman and he had a morning appointment clear across the\ncontinent. The others, not having his particular gift, had to take\nthe helibus to their different destinations. Mother, as I said, was a\npsychiatrist. Sylvia wrote advertising copy. Tim was a meteorologist.\nDan was a junior executive in a furniture moving company and expected a\npromotion to senior rank as soon as he achieved a better mental grip on\npianos.\n  \n \n  Only I had no job, no profession, no place in life. Of course there\nwere certain menial tasks a psi-negative could perform, but my parents\nwould have none of them\u2014partly for my sake, but mostly for the sake of\ntheir own community standing.\n  \n \n  \"We don't need what little money Kev could bring in,\" my father always\nsaid. \"I can afford to support my family. He can stay home and take\ncare of the house.\"\n  \n \n  And that's what I did. Not that there was much to do except call a\ntechno whenever one of the servomechanisms missed a beat. True enough,\nthose things had to be watched mighty carefully because, if they broke\ndown, it sometimes took days before the repair and/or replacement\nrobots could come. There never were enough of them because ours was a\nconstructive society. Still, being a machine-sitter isn't very much of\na career. And every function that wasn't the prerogative of a machine\ncould be done ten times more quickly and efficiently by some member of\nmy family than I could do it. If I went ahead and did something anyway,\nthey would just do it all over again when they got home.\n  \n \n  So I had nothing to do all day. I had a special dispensation to\ntake books out of the local Archives, because I was a deficient and\ncouldn't receive the tellie programs. Almost everybody on Earth was\ntelepathic to some degree and could get the amplified projections even\nif he couldn't transmit or receive with his natural powers. But I got\nnothing. I had to derive all my recreation from reading, and you can\nget awfully tired of books, especially when they're all at least a\nhundred years old and written by primitives. I could borrow sound\ntapes, but they also bored me after a while.\n  \n \n  I thought maybe I could develop a talent for composing or painting,\nwhich would classify me as a telesensitive\u2014artistic ability being\nconsidered as the oldest, if least important, psi power\u2014but I couldn't\neven do anything like that.\n  \n \n  About all there was left for me was to take long walks. Athletics were\nout of the question; I couldn't compete with psi-boys and they didn't\nwant to compete with me. All the people in the neighborhood knew me\nand were nice to me, but I didn't need to be a 'path to tell what they\nwere saying to one another when I hove into sight. \"There's that oldest\nFaraday boy. Pity, such a talented family, to have a defective.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  I didn't have a girl, either. Although some of them were sort of\nattracted to me\u2014I could see that\u2014they could hardly go out with me\nwithout exposing themselves to ridicule. In their sandals, I would have\ndone the same thing, but that didn't stop me from hating them.\n  \n<doc-sep>Now that the virus diseases had been licked, people hardly ever\ngot sick any more and, when they did, it was mostly psychosomatic.\nLife was so well organized that there weren't even many accidents\nthese days. It was a safe, orderly existence for those who fitted\ninto it\u2014which accounted for more than ninety-five per cent of the\npopulation. The only ones who didn't adjust were those who couldn't,\nlike me\u2014psi-deficients, throwbacks to an earlier era. There were no\nphysical cripples, because anybody could have a new arm or a new leg\ngrafted on, but you couldn't graft psi powers onto an atavism or, if\nyou could, the technique hadn't been developed yet.\n  \n \n  \"I feel a sense of impending doom brooding over this household,\" my\nyoungest brother remarked cheerfully as he vaulted into his chair.\n  \n \n  \"You always do, Timothy,\" my mother said, unfolding her napkin. \"And I\nmust say it's not in good taste, especially at breakfast.\"\n  \n \n  He reached for his juice. \"Guess this is a doomed household. And what\nwas all that emotional uproar about?\"\n  \n \n  \"The usual,\" Sylvia said from the doorway before anyone else could\nanswer. She slid warily into her chair. \"Hey, Dan, I'm here!\" she\ncalled. \"If anything else comes in, it comes in manually, understand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Dan emerged from the kitchen with a tray of food\nfloating ahead of him.\n  \n \n  \"The usual? Trouble with Kev?\" Tim looked at me narrowly. \"Somehow my\nsense of ominousness is connected with him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's perfectly natural\u2014\" Sylvia began, then stopped as Mother\ncaught her eye.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't mean that,\" Tim said. \"I still say Kev's got something we\ncan't figure out.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've been saying that for years,\" Danny protested, \"and he's been\ntested for every faculty under the Sun. He can't telepath or teleport\nor telekinesthesize or even teletype. He can't precognize or prefix or\nprepossess. He can't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Strictly a bundle of no-talent, that's me,\" I interrupted, trying to\nkeep my animal feelings from getting the better of me. That was how my\nfamily thought of me, I knew\u2014as an animal, and not a very lovable one,\neither.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Tim said, \"he's just got something we haven't developed a test\nfor. It'll come out some day, you'll see.\" He smiled at me.\n  \n"

I could feel them all the way\nupstairs. And today I'm working on the Sleepsweet Mattress copy, so I\nmust feel absolutely tranquil. Everyone will think beautiful thoughts,\nplease.\"\n  \n \n  She sat down just as a glass of orange juice was arriving at her\nplace; Danny apparently didn't know she'd come in already. The glass\nbumped into the back of her neck, tilted and poured its contents over\nher shoulder and down her very considerable decolletage. Being a mere\nprimitive, I couldn't help laughing.\n  \n \n  \"Danny, you fumbler!\" she screamed.\n  \n \n  Danny erupted from the kitchen. \"How many times have I asked all of you\nnot to sit down until I've got everything on the table? Always a lot of\ninterfering busybodies getting in the way.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't see why you have to set the table at all,\" she retorted. \"A\nrobot could do it better and faster than you. Even Kev could.\" She\nturned quickly toward me. \"Oh, I am sorry, Kevin.\"\n  \n \n  I didn't say anything; I was too busy pressing my hands down on the\nback of the chair to make my knuckles turn white.\n  \n \n  Sylvia's face turned even whiter. \"Father, stop him\u2014\n   \n   stop\n   \n  him! He's\nhating again! I can't stand it!\"\n  \n \n  Father looked at me, then at her. \"I don't think he can help it,\nSylvia.\"\n  \n \n  I grinned. \"That's right\u2014I'm just a poor atavism with no control over\nmyself a-tall.\"\n  \n \n  Finally my mother came in from the kitchen; she was an old-fashioned\nwoman and didn't hold with robocooks. One quick glance at me gave her\nthe complete details, even though I quickly protested, \"It's illegal to\nprobe anyone without permission.\"\n  \n \n  \"I used to probe you to find out when you needed your diapers changed,\"\nshe said tartly, \"and I'll probe you now. You should watch yourself,\nSylvia\u2014poor Kevin isn't responsible.\"\n  \n \n  She didn't need to probe to get the blast of naked emotion that spurted\nout from me. My sister screamed and even Father looked uncomfortable.\nDanny stomped back into the kitchen, muttering to himself.\n  \n \n  Mother's lips tightened. \"Sylvia, go upstairs and change your dress.\nKevin, do I have to make an appointment for you at the clinic again?\"\nA psychiatrist never diagnosed members of his own family\u2014that is, not\nofficially; they couldn't help offering thumbnail diagnoses any more\nthan they could help having thumbnails.\n  \n \n  \"No use,\" I said, deciding it was safe to drop into my chair. \"Who can\nadjust me to an environment to which I'm fundamentally unsuited?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe there is something physically wrong with him, Amy,\" my father\nsuggested hopefully. \"Maybe you should make an appointment for him at\nthe cure-all?\"\n  \n \n  Mother shook her neatly coiffed head. \"He's been to it dozens of times\nand he always checks out in splendid shape. None of us can spare the\ntime to go with him again, just on an off-chance, and he could hardly\nbe allowed to make such a long trip all by himself. Pity there isn't a\nmachine in every community, but, then, we don't really need them.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him\nall this.\n  \n \n  She went on, \"Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a\nhome for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful\nfuture for them as well\u2014not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by\nyear, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos\nAires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would\nteach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where\nhe would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so\non. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been\naway. His research was keeping him very busy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Jack broke in with, \"Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive\nwork on growth and fertilization?\"\n  \n \n  Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering\ndarkness. \"But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early\nevening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to\nthe station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary\nrode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering\nto the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the\nsaddle to welcome him home.\n  \n \n  \"Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station\nwagon had to be sent down for that.\" She looked defiantly at Jack. \"I\ndrove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.\"\n  \n \n  She paused. \"It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold\nline of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were\nwaiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the\nstation. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the\ngravel of the crossing.\n  \n \n  \"Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and\nHilda followed\u2014to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage\nthat, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as\nher horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.\n  \n \n  \"Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he\nwas out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In\nfact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary\u2014I mean, what had been\nMary\u2014and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.\"\n  \n \n  A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened\nand was silent. Jack turned.\n  \n \n  The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall\u2014a seemingly young,\nsensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was\na click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray\nhair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive\nmouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the\nyouth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Barr,\" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.\n  \n \n  The great biologist had come home.\n  \n"

Finding\n    \n   one worth living for is the genuine problem!\n   \n \n \n \n  In the region of the Coal Sack Nebula, on the dead fourth planet of\na star called Tyban, Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command stood\ncounting buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He wondered if there was any\nsignificance in the number. He had no idea.\n  \n \n  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  Lieutenant Ball, the executive officer of the ship, almost tried to\nscratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing a spacesuit.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like a temporary camp,\" Ball said. \"Very few buildings, and all\nbuilt out of native materials, the only stuff available. Castaways,\nmaybe?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens was silent as he walked up onto the rise. The flat weathered\nstone jutted out of the sand before him.\n  \n \n  \"No inscriptions,\" he pointed out.\n  \n \n  \"They would have been worn away. See the wind grooves? Anyway, there's\nnot another building on the whole damn planet. You wouldn't call it\nmuch of a civilization.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't think these are native?\"\n  \n \n  Ball said he didn't. Steffens nodded.\n  \n \n  Standing there and gazing at the stone, Steffens felt the awe of great\nage. He had a hunch, deep and intuitive, that this was old\u2014\n   \n   too\n   \n  old.\nHe reached out a gloved hand, ran it gently over the smooth stone\nridges of the wall. Although the atmosphere was very thin, he noticed\nthat the buildings had no airlocks.\n  \n \n  Ball's voice sounded in his helmet: \"Want to set up shop, Skipper?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens paused. \"All right, if you think it will do any good.\"\n  \n \n  \"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. These\nthings are on a raised rock foundation, swept clean by the wind. And\nyou can see that the rock itself is native\u2014\" he indicated the ledge\nbeneath their feet\u2014\"and was cut out a long while back.\"\n  \n \n  \"How long?\"\n  \n \n  Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. \"I wouldn't like to say off-hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Make a rough estimate.\"\n  \n \n  Ball looked at the captain, knowing what was in his mind. He smiled\nwryly and said: \"Five thousand years? Ten thousand? I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens whistled.\n  \n \n  Ball pointed again at the wall. \"Look at the striations. You can tell\nfrom that alone. It would take even a brisk Earth wind\n   \n   at least\n   \n  several thousand years to cut that deep, and the wind here has only a\nfraction of that force.\"\n  \n \n  The two men stood for a long moment in silence. Man had been in\ninterstellar space for three hundred years and this was the first\nuncovered evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race. It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\n  \n \n  Man had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\n  \n \n  Which ought to give\n   \n   them\n   \n  , thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"You have done well,\" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report\non the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. \"We now\nhave located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to\nOrtha at once.\n  \n \n  \"I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the\ncomplete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations\nof the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they\nwere permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that\nthree circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient\nfor the purposes of complete liquidation.\"\n  \n \n  \"But why,\" asked Thig slowly, \"could we not disarm all the natives and\nexile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for\nexample or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once\na race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own\ndegree of knowledge and comfort?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only the good of the Horde matters!\" shouted Torp angrily. \"Shall a\nrace of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way\nof a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The\nLaw of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,\" gritted out Thig savagely.\n\"Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.\nThere are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long\nforgotten.\"\n  \n \n  \"Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,\" ordered Torp shortly. \"His\nwords are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this\nworld. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.\"\n  \n \n  Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the\nsquat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments\nand gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the\nwalls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of\na decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of\nthe invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or\nvegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.\n  \n \n  The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble\nclutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's\nbroad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly\nhe knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children\nof the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must\nstand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an\nempty world\u2014this planet was not for them.\n  \n \n  \"Turn back!\" he cried wildly. \"I must go back to Earth. There is a\nwoman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need\nthis planet.\"\n  \n \n  Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its\ncase. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac\nof the finest members of the Horde.\n  \n \n  \"No human being is more important than the Horde,\" he stated baldly.\n\"This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we\nmust eliminate for the good of the Horde.\"\n  \n \n  Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick\njaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying\nthe Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into\nKam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it\ncould be uttered.\n  \n \n  Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness\nand dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and\nfor long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly\nstruggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand\nfought against that lone arm of Thig.\n  \n<doc-sep>Up in the committee room, the other Wolvers slumped around the table.\nOnly little Dotty sat straight and staring, speechless and unanswering,\nquite beyond their reach, like a telephone off the hook and with the\nconnection open, but no voice from the other end.\n  \n \n  They had just switched off the TV after listening to a confused\nmedley of denials, prayers, Kometevskyite chatterings, and a few\nastonishingly realistic comments on the possibility of survival.\n  \n \n  These last pointed out that, on the side of the Earth opposite the\nPacific, the convulsions would come slowly when the entombed spaceship\nburst forth\u2014provided, as seemed the case, that it moved without jets\nor reaction.\n  \n \n  It would be as if the Earth's vast core simply vanished. Gravity would\ndiminish abruptly to a fraction of its former value. The empty envelope\nof rock and water and air would slowly fall together, though at the\nsame time the air would begin to escape from the debris because there\nwould no longer be the mass required to hold it.\n  \n \n  However, there might be definite chances of temporary and even\nprolonged survival for individuals in strong, hermetically sealed\nstructures, such as submarines and spaceships. The few spaceships on\nEarth were reported to have blasted off, or be preparing to leave, with\nas many passengers as could be carried.\n  \n \n  But most persons, apparently, could not contemplate action of any sort.\nThey could only sit and think, like the Wolvers.\n  \n \n  A faint smile relaxed Celeste's face. She was thinking,\n   \n   how beautiful!\nIt means the death of the Solar System, which is a horrifying\nsubjective concept. Objectively, though, it would be a more awesome\nsight than any human being has ever seen or ever could see. It's an\nabsurd and even brutal thing to wish\u2014but I wish I could see the whole\ncataclysm from beginning to end.

There\nseems to be\u2014there\n   \n   is\n   \n  a change in them. Where they were harsh and\nvindictive before, they now are gentle and conciliatory.\" She paused,\nthe alarm on her childish features pinching into anxious uncertainty.\n\"Our pursuers have always been shrewd. The change in them may be false,\nintended merely to lull us into allowing them to come close enough to\ndestroy us. We must not fall into the trap by growing hopeful....\"\n  \n \n  They leaned forward, clutching hands, watching the little face as\nthough it were a television screen. Celeste had the wild feeling that\nshe was listening to a communique from a war so unthinkably vast and\nviolent, between opponents so astronomically huge and nearly immortal,\nthat she felt like no more than a reasoning ameba ... and then realized\nwith an explosive urge to laugh that that was exactly the situation.\n  \n \n  \"No!\" said Dotty. Her eyes began to glow. \"They\n   \n   have\n   \n  changed! During\nthe eons in which we lay sealed away and hidden from them, knowing\nnothing of them, they have rebelled against the tyranny of a communal\nmind to which no thoughts are private ... the tyranny that we ourselves\nfled to escape.

It was\nan historic moment, but neither of them was thinking about history.\n  \n \n  Man had been in space for only three hundred years. Whatever had built\nthese had been in space for thousands of years.\n  \n \n  Which ought to give\n   \n   them\n   \n  , thought Steffens uncomfortably, one hell of\na good head-start.\n  \n<doc-sep>When he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\n  \n \n  The gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\n  \n \n  The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\n  \n \n  It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n  \n \n  \"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\n  \n \n  He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n  \n \n  \"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\n  \n \n  A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\n  \n \n  I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\n  \n \n  And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\n  \n \n  He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\n  \n \n \n   The clock was warm.\n   \n \n \n  He felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\n  \n \n  He touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\n  \n \n  Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\n  \n \n  He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\n  \n<doc-sep>  Raiders of the Second Moon\n  \n \n  By GENE ELLERMAN\n  \n \n  A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world\u2014to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n  \n"

A certain amount of physical knowledge was imparted to us at\nbirth by the Makers. We spend the main part of our time expanding that\nknowledge wherever possible. We have made some progress in the natural\nsciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you see, is\nto serve the Makers. Any ability we can acquire will make us that much\nmore fit to serve when the Makers return.\"\n  \n \n  \"When they return?\" It had not occurred to Steffens until now that the\nrobots expected the Makers to do so.\n  \n \n  Elb regarded him out of the band of the circling eye. \"I see you had\nsurmised that the Makers were not coming back.\"\n  \n \n  If the robot could have laughed, Steffens thought it would have, then.\nBut it just stood there, motionless, its tone politely emphatic.\n  \n \n  \"It has always been our belief that the Makers would return. Why else\nwould we have been built?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens thought the robot would go on, but it didn't. The question, to\nElb, was no question at all.\n  \n \n  Although Steffens knew already what the robot could not possibly have\nknown\u2014that the Makers were gone and would never come back\u2014he was a\nlong time understanding. What he did was push this speculation into the\nback of his mind, to keep it from Elb. He had no desire to destroy a\nfaith.\n  \n \n  But it created a problem in him. He had begun to picture for Elb the\nstructure of human society, and the robot\u2014a machine which did not eat\nor sleep\u2014listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens\nmentioned God.\n  \n \n  \"God?\" the robot repeated without comprehension. \"What is God?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens explained briefly, and the robot answered:\n  \n \n  \"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that you\nwere the Makers returning\u2014\" Steffens remembered the brief lapse, the\nseeming disappointment he had sensed\u2014\"but then we probed your minds\nand found that you were not, that you were another kind of being,\nunlike either the Makers or ourselves. You were not even\u2014\" Elb caught\nhimself\u2014\"you did not happen to be telepaths. Therefore we troubled\nover who made you. We did detect the word 'Maker' in your theology,\nbut it seemed to have a peculiar\u2014\" Elb paused for a long while\u2014\"an\nuntouchable, intangible meaning which varies among you.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens understood. He nodded.\n  \n \n  The Makers were the robots' God, were all the God they needed. The\nMakers had built them, the planet, the universe. If he were to ask them\nwho made the Makers, it would be like their asking him who made God.\n  \n \n  It was an ironic parallel, and he smiled to himself.\n  \n \n  But on that planet, it was the last time he smiled.\n  \n<doc-sep>Both men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically\nfor the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or\ncare.\n  \n \n  Finally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area\naround the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n  \n \n  \"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n  \n \n  \"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It\ntalked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I\nused to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"There are other books. We'll get another.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"There are no more.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with\nsongs.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  killed it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying\nforgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too\nweak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage.\n  \n \n  When he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night\nwhen I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take\nthem we lose forever.\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never\nheard of negotiation?\"\n  \n \n  \"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One\neither loves them, or kills them.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step\nfrom star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that.\nJust an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would\never guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit\nme and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day\nI'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than\nthat.\"\n  \n"

When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\n  \n \n  The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\n   \n   feel\n   \n  their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\n  \n \n  Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\n  \n \n  Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things. There was something in their\nvery lines which was pleasant and relaxing.\n  \n \n  Their builders, Steffens thought, had probably thought of that, too.\n  \n \n  \"There's no harm in them,\" said Ball at last, openly, not minding if\nthe robots heard. \"They seem actually glad we're here. My God, whoever\nheard of a robot being glad?\"\n  \n \n  Steffens, embarrassed, spoke quickly to the nearest mechanical: \"I hope\nyou will forgive us our curiosity, but\u2014yours is a remarkable race. We\nhave never before made contact with a race like yours.\" It was said\nhaltingly, but it was the best he could do.\n  \n \n  The robot made a singularly human nodding motion of its head.\n  \n \n  \"I perceive that the nature of our construction is unfamiliar to you.\nYour question is whether or not we are entirely 'mechanical.' I am\nnot exactly certain as to what the word 'mechanical' is intended to\nconvey\u2014I would have to examine your thought more fully\u2014but I believe\nthat there is fundamental similarity between our structures.\"\n  \n \n  The robot paused. Steffens had a distinct impression that it was\ndisconcerted.\n  \n \n  \"I must tell you,\" the thing went on, \"that we ourselves are\u2014curious.\"\nIt stopped suddenly, struggling with a word it could not comprehend.\nSteffens waited, listening with absolute interest. It said at length:\n  \n \n  \"We know of only two types of living structure. Ours, which is largely\nmetallic, and that of the\n   \n   Makers\n   \n  , which would appear to be somewhat\nmore like yours. I am not a\u2014doctor\u2014and therefore cannot acquaint you\nwith the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you are\ninterested I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be\nof assistance.\"\n  \n \n  It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while\nBall and the second robot looked on in silence. The Makers, obviously,\nwere whoever or whatever had built the robots, and the \"doctors,\"\nSteffens decided, were probably just that\u2014doctor-robots, designed\nspecifically to care for the apparently flesh-bodies of the Makers.\n  \n \n  The efficiency of the things continued to amaze him, but the question\nhe had been waiting to ask came out now with a rush:\n  \n \n  \"Can you tell us where the Makers are?\"\n  \n \n  Both robots stood motionless. It occurred to Steffens that he couldn't\nreally be sure which was speaking. The voice that came to him spoke\nwith difficulty.\n  \n \n  \"The Makers\u2014are not here.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens stared in puzzlement. The robot detected his confusion and\nwent on:\n  \n \n  \"The Makers have gone away. They have been gone for a very long time.\"\n  \n \n  Could that be\n   \n   pain\n   \n  in its voice, Steffens wondered, and then the\nspectre of the ruined cities rose harsh in his mind.\n  \n \n  War. The Makers had all been killed in that war. And these had not been\nkilled.\n  \n \n  He tried to grasp it, but he couldn't. There were robots here in the\nmidst of a radiation so lethal that\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  ,\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  could live;\nrobots on a dead planet, living in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide.\n  \n \n  The carbon dioxide brought him up sharp.\n  \n \n  If there had been life here once, there would have been plant life as\nwell, and therefore oxygen. If the war had been so long ago that the\nfree oxygen had since gone out of the atmosphere\u2014good God, how old\nwere the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\n  \n \n  Were they immortal?\n  \n<doc-sep>Steffens had not realized that there were so many.\n  \n \n  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were arriving\neven as the skiff landed; they glided in over the rocky hills with\nfantastic ease and power, so that Steffens felt a momentary anxiety.\nMost of the robots were standing with the silent immobility of metal.\nOthers threaded their way to the fore and came near the skiff, but none\ntouched it, and a circle was cleared for Steffens when he came out.\n  \n \n \n \n  One of the near robots came forward alone, moving, as Steffens now\nsaw, on a number of short, incredibly strong and agile legs. The black\nthing paused before him, extended a hand as it had done in the picture.\nSteffens took it, he hoped, warmly; felt the power of the metal through\nthe glove of his suit.\n  \n \n  \"Welcome,\" the robot said, speaking again to his mind, and now\nSteffens detected a peculiar alteration in the robot's tone. It was\nless friendly now, less\u2014Steffens could not understand\u2014somehow less\n   \n   interested\n   \n  , as if the robot had been\u2014expecting someone else.\n  \n \n  \"Thank you,\" Steffens said. \"We are deeply grateful for your permission\nto land.\"\n  \n \n  \"Our desire,\" the robot repeated mechanically, \"is only to serve.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly, Steffens began to feel alone, surrounded by machines. He\ntried to push the thought out of his mind, because he knew that they\n   \n   should\n   \n  seem inhuman. But....\n  \n \n  \"Will the others come down?\" asked the robot, still mechanically.\n  \n \n  Steffens felt his embarrassment. The ship lay high in the mist above,\njets throbbing gently.\n  \n \n  \"They must remain with the ship,\" Steffens said aloud, trusting to the\nrobot's formality not to ask him why. Although, if they could read his\nmind, there was no need to ask.\n  \n \n  For a long while, neither spoke, long enough for Steffens to grow tense\nand uncomfortable. He could not think of a thing to say, the robot was\nobviously waiting, and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men\nto come on out of the skiff.\n  \n \n  They came, wonderingly, and the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard\nthe one robot speak again. The voice was now much more friendly.\n  \n \n  \"We hope you will forgive us for intruding upon your thought. It is\nour\u2014custom\u2014not to communicate unless we are called upon. But when we\nobserved that you were in ignorance of our real\u2014nature\u2014and were about\nto leave our planet, we decided to put aside our custom, so that you\nmight base your decision upon sufficient data.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens replied haltingly that he appreciated their action.\n  \n \n  \"We perceive,\" the robot went on, \"that you are unaware of our complete\naccess to your mind, and would perhaps be\u2014dismayed\u2014to learn that\nwe have been gathering information from you. We must\u2014apologize.\nOur only purpose was so that we could communicate with you. Only\nthat information was taken which is necessary for communication\nand\u2014understanding. We will enter your minds henceforth only at your\nrequest.\"\n  \n \n  Steffens did not react to the news that his mind was being probed\nas violently as he might have. Nevertheless it was a shock, and he\nretreated into observant silence as the Aliencon men went to work.\n  \n \n  The robot which seemed to have been doing the speaking was in no way\ndifferent from any of the others in the group. Since each of the robots\nwas immediately aware of all that was being said or thought, Steffens\nguessed that they had sent one forward just for appearance's sake,\nbecause they perceived that the Earthmen would feel more at home. The\npicture of the extended hand, the characteristic handshake of Earthmen,\nhad probably been borrowed, too, for the same purpose of making him and\nthe others feel at ease. The one jarring note was the robot's momentary\nlapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the things had seemed\nalmost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to\nexamine the first robot in detail.\n  \n \n  It was not very tall, being at least a foot shorter than the Earthmen.\nThe most peculiar thing about it, except for the circling eye-band of\nthe head, was a mass of symbols which were apparently engraved upon the\nmetal chest. Symbols in row upon row\u2014numbers, perhaps\u2014were upon the\nchest, and repeated again below the level of the arms, and continued\nin orderly rows across the front of the robot, all the way down to the\nbase of the trunk. If they were numbers, Steffens thought, then it was\na remarkably complicated system. But he noticed the same pattern on\nthe nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to conclude\nthat the symbols were merely decoration and let it go tentatively at\nthat, although the answer seemed illogical.\n  \n \n  It wasn't until he was on his way home that Steffens remembered the\nsymbols again. And only then did he realized what they were.\n  \n"

        "After a while, convinced that there was no danger, Steffens had the\nship brought down. When the crew came out of the airlock, they were met\nby the robots, and each man found himself with a robot at his side,\nhumbly requesting to be of service. There were literally thousands of\nthe robots now, come from all over the barren horizon. The mass of them\nstood apart, immobile on a plain near the ship, glinting in the sun\nlike a vast, metallic field of black wheat.\n  \n \n  The robots had obviously been built to serve. Steffens began to\n   \n   feel\n   \n  their pleasure, to sense it in spite of the blank, expressionless\nfaces. They were almost like children in their eagerness, yet they were\nstill reserved. Whoever had built them, Steffens thought in wonder, had\nbuilt them well.\n  \n \n  Ball came to join Steffens, staring at the robots through the clear\nplastic of his helmet with baffledly widened eyes. A robot moved out\nfrom the mass in the field, allied itself to him. The first to speak\nhad remained with Steffens.\n  \n \n  Realizing that the robot could hear every word he was saying, Ball\nwas for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of standing and\ntalking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead metal upon the\nbare rock of a dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died.\nIt was impossible not to like the things.

Steffens looked at Ball, then at the silent robots,\nthen out across the field to where the rest of them stood. The black\nwheat. Steffens felt a deep chill.\n  \n \n  Were they immortal?\n  \n<doc-sep>The Earthmen remained for several weeks. During that time, Steffens was\nusually with Elb, talking now as often as he listened, and the Aliencon\nteam roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the\nstrangest culture in history. There was still the mystery of those\nbuildings on Tyban IV; that, as well as the robots' origin, would have\nto be cleared up before they could leave.\n  \n \n  Surprisingly, Steffens did not think about the future. Whenever he came\nnear a robot, he sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling\nthat it warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the robots\nthat he did little thinking.\n  \n \n  Something he had not realized at the beginning was that he was as\nunusual to the robots as they were to him. It came to him with a great\nshock that not one of the robots had ever seen a living thing. Not a\nbug, a worm, a leaf. They did not know what flesh was. Only the doctors\nknew that, and none of them could readily understand what was meant by\nthe words \"organic matter.\" It had taken them some time to recognize\nthat the Earthmen wore suits which were not parts of their bodies, and\nit was even more difficult for them to understand why the suits were\nneeded.\n  \n \n  But when they did understand, the robots did a surprising thing.\n  \n \n  At first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen\ncould remain outside the ship for long, even in radiation suits. And\none morning, when Steffens came out of the ship, it was to discover\nthat hundreds of the robots, working through the night, had effectively\ndecontaminated the entire area.\n  \n \n  It was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there were.\nHe learned to his amazement that there were more than nine million.\nThe great mass of them had politely remained a great distance from the\nship, spread out over the planet, since they were highly radioactive.\n  \n \n  Steffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his mind.\nThe robot extracted all the knowledge of matter that Steffens held,\npondered over the knowledge and tried to digest it, and passed it on to\nthe other robots. Steffens, in turn, had a difficult time picturing the\nmind of a thing that had never known life.\n  \n \n  He had a vague idea of the robot's history\u2014more, perhaps, then they\nknew themselves\u2014but he refrained from forming an opinion until\nAliencon made its report. What fascinated him was Elb's amazing\nphilosophy, the only outlook, really, that the robot could have had.\n  \n<doc-sep>Steffens had not realized that there were so many.\n  \n \n  They had been gathering since his ship was first seen, and now there\nwere hundreds of them clustered upon the hill.

        " \n  A CITY NEAR CENTAURUS\n  \n \n  By BILL DOEDE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WEST\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine October 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   The city was sacred, but not to its gods.\n    \n   Michaelson was a god\u2014but far from sacred!\n   \n \n \n \n  Crouched in the ancient doorway like an animal peering out from his\nburrow, Mr. Michaelson saw the native.\n  \n \n  At first he was startled, thinking it might be someone else from the\nEarth settlement who had discovered the old city before him. Then he\nsaw the glint of sun against the metallic skirt, and relaxed.\n  \n \n  He chuckled to himself, wondering with amusement what a webfooted man\nwas doing in an old dead city so far from his people. Some facts were\nknown about the people of Alpha Centaurus II. They were not actually\nnatives, he recalled. They were a colony from the fifth planet of\nthe system. They were a curious people. Some were highly intelligent,\nthough uneducated.\n  \n \n  He decided to ignore the man for the moment. He was far down the\nancient street, a mere speck against the sand. There would be plenty of\ntime to wonder about him.\n  \n \n  He gazed out from his position at the complex variety of buildings\nbefore him. Some were small, obviously homes. Others were huge\nwith tall, frail spires standing against the pale blue sky. Square\nbuildings, ellipsoid, spheroid. Beautiful, dream-stuff bridges\nconnected tall, conical towers, bridges that still swung in the wind\nafter half a million years. Late afternoon sunlight shone against ebony\nsurfaces. The sands of many centuries had blown down the wide streets\nand filled the doorways. Desert plants grew from roofs of smaller\nbuildings.\n  \n \n  Ignoring the native, Mr. Michaelson poked about among the ruins\nhappily, exclaiming to himself about some particular artifact,\nmarveling at its state of preservation, holding it this way and that to\ncatch the late afternoon sun, smiling, clucking gleefully. He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\n  \n<doc-sep>He paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward\nthem from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was\nbarefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around\nher sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her\nbrown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table\ncloth at one time in its history.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" she breathed. \"By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a\nman!\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't let him get away!\" cried Ann.\n  \n \n  \"Hilda!\" the brunette shrieked. \"A man! It's a man!\"\n  \n \n  A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off\nwarily.\n  \n \n  Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: \"Don't let him get away!\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way\nhe had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the\ncanyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the\nbend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.\n  \n \n  Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer\nweight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up\nbodily, started up the canyon chanting: \"\n   \n   He was a rocket riding daddy\nfrom Mars.\n   \n  \" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.\n  \n \n  Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the\nspaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had\nbeen broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of\nhis left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy,\ntough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from\nmortification.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Put me down. I'll walk.\"\n  \n \n  \"You won't try to get away?\" said Ann.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being\nheld aloft by four barbarous young women.\n  \n \n  \"Let him down,\" said Ann. \"We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a\nbreak.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between\ntwo husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease\nwith which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light\nweight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the\nplains. He wished he was a centaur.\n  \n \n  The trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan\npicked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. \"Don't be afraid,\" advised\none of his captors. \"Just don't look down.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not afraid,\" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow\nledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from\nunder him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment\nhe thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck,\nhauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a\nrope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top\nlike a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it.\n  \n \n  The trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking\nthe prairie.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" cried Ann pointing over the edge.\n  \n \n  A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first,\nJonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up\nthey resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to\nhis own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs!\" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes.\n  \n<doc-sep>The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who\nreared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they\nhurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly\nlike the neighing of horses.\n  \n \n  Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem\nof the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred\nto him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's\nmoon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to\nthe lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty\ntimes as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.\n  \n \n  At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults\nback and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls\nresumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.\nThe brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Olga,\" she confided. \"Has anybody ever told you what a handsome\nfellow you are?\" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.\n  \n \n  They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep\nvalley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees\nalong its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of\nthe valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.\n  \n \n  They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind\na promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming\nordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew\nthe girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp\nlike a bag of meal.\n  \n \n  The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner\nreappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded\nand rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded\nhim of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He\nlooked away hastily.\n  \n \n  Someone hailed them from the space ship.\n  \n \n  \"We've caught a man,\" shrieked one of his captors.\n  \n \n  A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She\nhad green eyes. \"We're rescued!\"\n  \n \n  \"No. No,\" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. \"He was wrecked like us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" came a disappointed chorus.\n  \n \n  \"He's a man,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"That's the next best thing.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Olga,\" said a strapping brunette. \"Who'd ever thought a man could\nlook so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"I did,\" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered\nlike an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt\nlike a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.\n  \n \n  A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,\n\"Dinner's ready.\" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of\nthe voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him\nappraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. \"Bring him\ninto the ship,\" she said. \"The man must be starved.\"\n  \n \n  He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the\nwrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of\nthe floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His\nfeet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the\nThirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.\n  \n \n  With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang\nforward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be\nseated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like\na captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar\nsettings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan\nFawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild\nwomen.\n  \n"

The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim\u2014but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings\u2014a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor\u2014the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n  \n"

There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\n  \n \n  Michaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\n  \n \n  Darkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\n  \n \n  He stood there alone feeling the age of the place. Even the smell\nof age was in the air. Silver moonlight from the two moons filtered\nthrough clear air down upon the ruins. The city lay now in darkness,\ndead and still, waiting for morning so it could lie dead and still in\nthe sun.\n  \n \n  There was no hurry to be going home, although he was alone, although\nthis was Alpha Centaurus II with many unknowns, many dangers ...\nalthough home was a very great distance away. There was no one back\nthere to worry about him.\n  \n \n  His wife had died many years ago back on Earth. No children. His\nfriends in the settlement would not look for him for another day at\nleast. Anyway, the tiny cylinder, buried in flesh behind his ear, a\nthing of mystery and immense power, could take him home instantly,\nwithout effort save a flicker of thought.\n  \n \n  \"You did not leave, as I asked you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson whirled around at the sound of the native's voice. Then he\nrelaxed. He said, \"You shouldn't sneak up on a man like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must leave, or I will be forced to kill you. I do not want to kill\nyou, but if I must....\" He made a clucking sound deep in the throat.\n\"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense. Superstition! But never mind. You have been here longer\nthan I. Tell me, what are those instruments in the rooms? It looks like\na clock but I'm certain it had some other function.\"\n  \n \n  \"What rooms?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, come now. The small rooms back there. Look like they were\nbedrooms.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not know.\" The webfoot drew closer. Michaelson decided he was\nsixty or seventy years old, at least.\n  \n \n  \"You've been here a long time. You are intelligent, and you must be\neducated, the way you talk. That gadget looks like a time-piece of some\nsort. What is it? What does it measure?\"\n  \n \n  \"I insist that you go.\" The webfoot held something in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"No.\" Michaelson looked off down the street, trying to ignore the\nnative, trying to feel the life of the city as it might have been.\n  \n<doc-sep>The native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\n  \n \n  The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n  \n \n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why? Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am keeper of the city.\"\n  \n \n  \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits may return.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave!\"\n  \n \n  The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\n  \n \n  He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\n  \n"

        "When he awoke dawn was red against thin clouds in the east.\n  \n \n  Old Maota stood in the street with webbed feet planted far apart in\nthe sand, a weapon in the crook of his arm. It was a long tube affair,\nfamiliar to Michaelson.\n  \n \n  Michaelson asked, \"Did you sleep well?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry to hear that.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, but my head aches a little.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Maota said.\n  \n \n  \"For what?\"\n  \n \n  \"For hitting you. Pain is not for gods like you.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson relaxed somewhat. \"What kind of man are you? First you try\nto break my skull, then you apologize.\"\n  \n \n  \"I abhor pain. I should have killed you outright.\"\n  \n \n  He thought about that for a moment, eyeing the weapon.\n  \n \n  It looked in good working order. Slim and shiny and innocent, it looked\nlike a glorified African blowgun. But he was not deceived by its\nappearance. It was a deadly weapon.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Well,\" he said, \"before you kill me, tell me about the book.\" He held\nit up for Maota to see.\n  \n \n  \"What about the book?\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of book is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"What does Mr. Earthgod mean, what\n   \n   kind\n   \n  of book? You have seen it. It\nis like any other book, except for the material and the fact that it\ntalks.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. I mean, what's in it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Poetry? For God's sake, why poetry? Why not mathematics or history?\nWhy not tell how to make the metal of the book itself? Now there is a\nsubject worthy of a book.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"One does not study a dead culture to learn how\nthey made things, but how they thought. But we are wasting time. I must\nkill you now, so I can get some rest.\"\n  \n \n  The old man raised the gun.\n  \n<doc-sep>When he regained consciousness the two moons, bright sentinel orbs in\nthe night sky, had moved to a new position down their sliding path. Old\nMaota's absence took some of the weirdness and fantasy away. It seemed\na more practical place now.\n  \n \n  The gash in his head was painful, throbbing with quick, short\nhammer-blows synchronized with his heart beats. But there was a new\ndetermination in him. If it was a fight that the old webfooted fool\nwanted, a fight he would get. The cylinder flicked him, at his command,\nacross five hundred miles of desert and rocks to a small creek he\nremembered. Here he bathed his head in cool water until all the caked\nblood was dissolved from his hair. Feeling better, he went back.\n  \n \n  The wind had turned cool. Michaelson shivered, wishing he had brought\na coat. The city was absolutely still except for small gusts of wind\nsighing through the frail spires. The ancient book still lay in the\nsand beside the dark spot of blood. He stooped over and picked it up.\n  \n \n  It was light, much lighter than most Earth books. He ran a hand over\nthe binding. Smooth it was, untouched by time or climate. He squinted\nat the pages, tilting the book to catch the bright moonlight, but the\nwriting was alien. He touched the page, ran his forefinger over the\nwriting.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sprang back. The book fell from his hands.\n  \n \n  \"God in heaven!\" he exclaimed.\n  \n \n  He had heard a voice. He looked around at the old buildings, down the\nlength of the ancient street. Something strange about the voice. Not\nMaota. Not his tones. Not his words. Satisfied that no one was near, he\nstooped and picked up the book again.\n  \n \n  \"Good God!\" he said aloud. It was the book talking. His fingers had\ntouched the writing again. It was not a voice, exactly, but a stirring\nin his mind, like a strange language heard for the first time.\n  \n \n  A talking book. What other surprises were in the city? Tall,\nfragile buildings laughing at time and weather. A clock measuring\nGod-knows-what. If such wonders remained, what about those already\ndestroyed? One could only guess at the machines, the gadgets, the\nartistry already decayed and blown away to mix forever with the sand.\n  \n \n  I must preserve it, he thought, whether Maota likes it or not. They\nsay these people lived half a million years ago. A long time. Let's\nsee, now. A man lives one hundred years on the average. Five thousand\nlifetimes.\n  \n \n  And all you do is touch a book, and a voice jumps across all those\nyears!\n  \n \n  He started off toward the tall building he had examined upon discovery\nof the city. His left eyelid began to twitch and he laid his forefinger\nagainst the eye, pressing until it stopped. Then he stooped and entered\nthe building. He laid the book down and tried to take the \"clock\"\noff the wall. It was dark in the building and his fingers felt along\nthe wall, looking for it. Then he touched it. His fingers moved over\nits smooth surface. Then suddenly he jerked his hand back with an\nexclamation of amazement. Fear ran up his spine.\n  \n \n \n   The clock was warm.\n   \n \n \n  He felt like running, like flicking back to the settlement where there\nwere people and familiar voices, for here was a thing that should not\nbe. Half a million years\u2014and here was warmth!\n  \n \n  He touched it again, curiosity overwhelming his fear. It was warm. No\nmistake. And there was a faint vibration, a suggestion of power. He\nstood there in the darkness staring off into the darkness, trembling.\nFear built up in him until it was a monstrous thing, drowning reason.\nHe forgot the power of the cylinder behind his ear. He scrambled\nthrough the doorway. He got up and ran down the ancient sandy street\nuntil he came to the edge of the city. Here he stopped, gasping for\nair, feeling the pain throb in his head.\n  \n \n  Common sense said that he should go home, that nothing worthwhile could\nbe accomplished at night, that he was tired, that he was weak from loss\nof blood and fright and running. But when Michaelson was on the trail\nof important discoveries he had no common sense.\n  \n \n  He sat down in the darkness, meaning to rest a moment.\n  \n<doc-sep>He turned and walked off, not looking back.\n  \n \n  Michaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building.

He crawled\nover the rubble through old doorways half filled with the accumulation\nof ages. He dug experimentally in the sand with his hands, like a dog,\nunder a roof that had weathered half a million years of rain and sun.\nThen he crawled out again, covered with dust and cobwebs.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"No!\" Maota's thought was prickled with fear and anger.\n  \n \n  Michaelson did not know how to try, but he remembered the cylinder and\ngathered all the force of his mind in spite of Maota's protests, and\ngave his most violent command.\n  \n \n  At first he thought it didn't work. He got up and looked around, then\nit struck him.\n   \n   He was standing up!\n   \n \n \n  The cylinder. He knew it was the cylinder. That was the difference\nbetween himself and Maota. When he used the cylinder, that was where\nhe went, the place where Maota was now. It was a door of some kind,\nleading to a path of some kind where distance was non-existent. But the\n\"clock\" was a mechanism to transport only the mind to that place.\n  \n \n  To be certain of it, he pressed the button again, with the same result\nas before. He saw his own body fall down. He felt Maota's presence.\n  \n \n  \"You devil!\" Maota's thought-scream was a sword of hate and anger,\nirrational suddenly, like a person who knows his loss is irrevocable.\n\"I said you were a god. I said you were a god.\n   \n   I said you were a\ngod...!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n"

As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started\naft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly\nthat Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers.\n  \n \n  Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet\nroom door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was\nmanipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One\nby one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence.\n  \n \n  The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable\nconditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open.\nQuickly the commander entered the blasted jet room.

The\nline accelerator was a shapeless ruin, but except for broken meter\nglasses and scorched control handles other mechanical damage appeared\nminor. They had been lucky.\n  \n \n  \"Turnover starts in six hours twelve minutes,\" the captain said\nmeaningfully.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind cleared his throat. \"We can change accelerators in two\nhours,\" he declared. With a quick reassumption of authority he began to\norder his crew into action.\n  \n \n  It took nearer three hours than two to change accelerators despite\nHind's shouted orders.\n  \n \n  At last the job was completed. Hind made a final check, floated over to\nthe control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he\nthrew in the accelerator switch.\n  \n \n  The meter needles climbed, soared past the red lines without pausing,\nand just in time to prevent a second blowback, Hind cut the power.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   There's metal in the field!\n   \n  \" His voice was high and unsteady.\n  \n<doc-sep>The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n  \n \n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n  \n \n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\n   \n   varpa\n   \n  cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n  \n \n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n  \n \n  Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n  \n \n  \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n  \n \n  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage.

The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open\nlock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He\nturned.\n  \n \n  \"Everything shipshape, I take it!\" he commented.\n  \n \n  The OD nodded. \"I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,\" he said.\n\"Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers\nready to lift as soon as they come back.\"\n  \n \n  The Exec tossed away his cigarette. \"\n   \n   If\n   \n  they come back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is there any question?\"\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged. \"I don't know, Lowry,\" he said. \"This is a funny\nplace. I don't trust the natives.\"\n  \n \n  Lowry lifted his eyebrows. \"Oh? But after all, they're human beings,\njust like us\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't\neven look human any more. Those white, flabby skins\u2014I don't like them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Acclimation,\" Lowry said scientifically. \"They had to acclimate\nthemselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.\"\n  \n \n  The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the\noutskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present\nVenusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing\nwonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of\nguards.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Lowry said suddenly, \"there's a minority who are afraid\nof us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.\nThey think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we\nknow Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground\ngroup that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the\nnative Venusians\u2014the descendants of the first expedition, that\nis\u2014right down into the mud. Well\u2014\" he laughed\u2014\"maybe they will.\nAfter all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic\nvoice rasped: \"Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments\nreports a spy ray focused on the main lock!\"\n  \n \n  Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and\nstared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure\nenough, it was glowing red\u2014might have been glowing for minutes. He\nsnatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.\n\"Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!\" But\neven while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly\nand went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.\n  \n \n  The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, \"You see!\"\n  \n"

The skin between his fingers and toes spread, grew into\nmembranous webs. The swellings in his neck became more pronounced and\ndark parallel lines appeared.\n  \n \n  But despite the doctor's pessimistic reports that the changes had not\nstopped, Barry continued to tell himself he was recovering. He had\nto believe and keep on believing to retain sanity in the face of the\nweird, unclassifiable feelings that surged through his body. Still\nhe was subject to fits of almost suicidal depression, and Dorothy's\nfailure to visit him did not help his mental condition.\n  \n \n  Then one day he woke from a nap and thought he was still dreaming.\nDorothy was leaning over him.\n  \n \n  \"Barry! Barry!\" she whispered. \"I can't help it. I love you even if you\ndo have a wife and child in Philadelphia.

She wrote to me before Three blasted\noff\u2014oh, the most piteous letter!\"\n  \n \n  Barry was fully awake now. \"I'm not married. I have no child.\nI've never been in Philadelphia,\" he shouted. His lips thinned.\n\"I\u2014think\u2014I\u2014know\u2014who\u2014wrote\u2014that\u2014letter!\" he declared grimly.\n  \n \n  \"Robson wouldn't!\" she objected, shocked, but there was a note of doubt\nin her voice.\n  \n \n  Then she was in his arms, sobbing openly.\n  \n \n  \"I believe you, Barry.\"\n  \n \n  She stayed with him for hours, and she had changed since the days\nat Training Base. Long months away from the patterned restraints of\ncivilization, living each day on the edge of unknown perils, had\nawakened in her the realization that she was a human being and a\nwoman, as well as a toxicologist.\n  \n \n  When the water-mist finally forced her departure she left Barry joyous\nand confident of his eventual recovery. For a few minutes anger\nsimmered in his brain as he contemplated the pleasure of rearranging\nRobson Hind's features.\n  \n \n  The accident with the scaffold had been remarkably convenient, but\nthis time the ruthless, restless, probably psychopathic drive that had\nmade Robson Hind more than just another rich man's spoiled son had\ncarried him too far. Barry wondered whether it had been inefficiency or\njudiciously distributed money that had made the psychometrists overlook\nsome undesirable traits in Hind's personality in accepting him for the\nFive Ship Plan.\n  \n \n  But even with his trickery Hind had lost.\n  \n \n  He slept, and woke with a feeling of doom.\n  \n \n  The slow Venusian twilight had ended in blackness and the overhead\ntubelight was off.\n  \n \n  He sat up, and apprehension gave way to burning torture in his chest.\n  \n \n  Silence! He fumbled for the light switch, then knelt beside the mist\nmachine that no longer hummed. Power and water supplies were both dead,\ncut off outside his room.\n  \n \n  Floating droplets were merging and falling to the floor. Soon the air\nwould be dry, and he would be choking and strangling. He turned to call\nfor help.\n  \n \n  The door was locked!\n  \n \n  He tugged and the knob came away in his hand. The retaining screw had\nbeen removed.\n  \n \n  He beat upon the panel, first with his fists and then with the metal\ndoorknob, but the insulation between the double alloy sheets was\nefficient soundproofing. Furiously he hurled himself upon it, only to\nbounce back with a bruised shoulder. He was trapped.\n  \n \n  Working against time and eventual death he snatched a metal chair\nand swung with all his force at the window, again, again, yet again.\nA small crack appeared in the transparent plastic, branched under\ncontinued hammering, became a rough star. He gathered his waning\nstrength, then swung once more. The tough plastic shattered.\n  \n \n  He tugged at the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame. Fog-laden\nVenusian air poured in\u2014but it was not enough!\n  \n \n  He dragged himself head first through the narrow opening, landed\nsprawling on hands and knees in the darkness. In his ears a confused\nrustling drone from the alien swamp mingled with the roar of\napproaching unconsciousness.\n  \n \n  There was a smell in his nostrils. The smell of water. He lurched\nforward at a shambling run, stumbling over the uneven ground.\n  \n \n  Then he plunged from the rocky ledge into the slough. Flashes of\ncolored light flickered before his eyes as he went under. But Earth\nhabits were still strong; instinctively he held his breath.\n  \n \n  Then he fainted. Voluntary control of his body vanished. His mouth hung\nslack and the breathing reflex that had been an integral part of his\nlife since the moment of birth forced him to inhale.\n  \n \n  Bubbles floated upward and burst. Then Barry Barr was lying in the ooze\nof the bottom. And he was breathing, extracting vital oxygen from the\nbrackish, silt-clouded water.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Slowly his racing heartbeat returned to normal. Gradually he became\naware of the stench of decaying plants and of musky taints he knew\ninstinctively were the scents of underwater animals. Then with a shock\nthe meaning became clear. He had become a water-breather, cut off from\nall other Earthmen, no longer entirely human. His fellows in the colony\nwere separated from him now by a gulf more absolute than the airless\nvoid between Earth and Venus.\n  \n \n  Something slippery and alive touched him near one armpit. He opened\nhis eyes in the black water and his groping hand clutched something\nburrowing into his skin. With a shudder of revulsion he crushed a fat\nworm between his fingers.\n  \n \n  Then dozens of them\u2014hundreds\u2014were upon him from all sides. He was\nwearing only a pair of khaki pants but the worms ignored his chest to\ncongregate around his face, intent on attacking the tender skin of his\neyelids.\n  \n \n  For a minute his flailing hands fought them off, but they came in\nincreasing numbers and clung like leeches. Pain spread as they bit and\nburrowed, and blindly he began to swim.\n  \n \n  Faster and faster. He could sense the winding banks of the slough and\nkept to midchannel, swimming with his eyes tightly closed. One by one\nthe worms dropped off.\n  \n \n  He stopped, opened his eyes, not on complete darkness this time but on\na faint blue-green luminescence from far below. The water was saltier\nhere, and clearer.\n  \n \n  He had swum down the slough and out into the ocean. He tried to turn\nback, obsessed by a desire to be near the colony even though he\ncould not go ashore without strangling, but he had lost all sense of\ndirection.\n  \n \n  He was still weak and his lungs were not completely adjusted to\nunderwater life. Again he grew dizzy and faint. The slow movements of\nhands and feet that held him just below the surface grew feeble and\nceased. He sank.\n  \n \n  Down into dimly luminous water he dropped, and with his respiratory\nsystem completely water-filled there was no sensation of pressure. At\nlast he floated gently to the bottom and lay motionless.\n  \n \n  Shouting voices awakened him, an exultant battle cry cutting through a\ngasping scream of anguish. Streaks of bright orange light were moving\ntoward him in a twisting pattern. At the head of each trail was a\nfigure. A human figure that weaved and swam in deadly moving combat.\nOne figure drifted limply bottomward.\n  \n \n  Hallucination, Barry told himself. Then one of the figures broke from\nthe group. Almost overhead it turned sharply downward and the feet\nmoved in a powerful flutter-kick. A slender spear aimed directly at the\nEarthman.\n  \n \n  Barry threw himself aside. The spear point plunged deep into the\nsticky, yielding bottom and Barry grappled with its wielder.\n  \n \n  Pointed fingernails raked his cheek. Barry's balled fist swung\nin a roundhouse blow but water resistance slowed the punch to\nineffectiveness. The creature only shook its head and came in kicking\nand clawing.\n  \n \n  Barry braced his feet against the bottom and leaped. His head butted\nthe attacker's chest and at the same instant he lashed a short jab to\nthe creature's belly. It slumped momentarily, its face working.\n  \n \n  Human\u2014or nearly so\u2014the thing was, with a stocky, powerful body and\nwebbed hands and feet. A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more\nfor ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face\nwas coarse and savage.\n  \n \n  It shook off the effects of Barry's punch and one webbed hand snatched\na short tube from its belt.\n  \n \n  Barry remembered the spring-opening knife in his pocket, and even as\nhe flicked the blade out the tube-weapon fired. Sound thrummed in the\nwater and the water grew milky with a myriad of bubbles. Something\nzipped past his head, uncomfortably close.\n  \n \n  Then Barry struck, felt his knife slice flesh and grate against bone.\nHe struck again even as the undersea being screamed and went limp.\n  \n \n  Barry stared through the reddening water.\n  \n \n  Another figure plunged toward him. Barry jerked the dead Venusian's\nspear from the mud and raised it defensively.\n  \n \n  But the figure paid no attention. This one was a female who fled\ndesperately from two men closing in from opposite sides. One threw his\nspear, using an odd pushing motion, and as she checked and dodged, the\nother was upon her from behind.\n  \n \n  One arm went around her neck in a strangler's hold, bending her slender\nbody backward. Together captor and struggling captive sank toward the\nbottom. The other recovered his thrown spear and moved in to help\nsecure her arms and legs with lengths of cord.\n  \n \n  One scooped up the crossbow the girl had dropped. The other ripped at\nher brief skirt and from her belt took a pair of tubes like the one the\ndead Venusian had fired at Barry, handling them as though they were\nloot of the greatest value. He jerked cruelly at the slender metallic\nnecklace the girl wore but it did not break.\n  \n \n  He punched the helpless girl in the abdomen with the butt of his spear.\nThe girl writhed but she did not attempt to cry out.\n  \n \n  Barry bounded toward them in a series of soaring leaps, knife and spear\nready. One Venusian turned to meet him, grinning maliciously.\n  \n \n  Barry dug one foot into the bottom and sidestepped a spear thrust. His\nown lunge missed completely. Then he and the Venusian were inside each\nother's spear points, chest to chest. A pointed hook strapped to the\ninside of the creature's wrist just missed Barry's throat. The Earthman\narched his body backward and his knife flashed upward. The creature\ngasped and pulled away, clutching with both hands at a gaping wound in\nits belly.\n  \n \n  The other one turned too late as Barry leaped.\n  \n \n  Barry's hilt cracked against its jawbone.\n  \n<doc-sep>Barry opened his eyes. The ship was in normal deceleration and Nick\nPodtiaguine was watching him from a nearby bunk.\n  \n \n  \"I could eat a cow with the smallpox,\" Barry declared.\n  \n \n  Nick grinned. \"No doubt. You slept around the clock and more. Nice job\nof work out there.\"\n  \n \n  Barry unhitched his straps and sat up.\n  \n \n  \"Say,\" he asked anxiously. \"What's haywire with the air?\"\n  \n \n  Nick looked startled. \"Nothing. Everything checked out when I came off\nwatch a few minutes ago.\"\n  \n \n  Barry shrugged. \"Probably just me. Guess I'll go see if I can mooch a\nhandout.\"\n  \n \n  He found himself a hero. The cook was ready to turn the galley inside\nout while a radio engineer and an entomologist hovered near to wait on\nhim. But he couldn't enjoy the meal. The sensations of heat and dryness\nhe had noticed on awakening grew steadily worse. It became difficult to\nbreathe.\n  \n \n  He started to rise, and abruptly the room swirled and darkened around\nhim. Even as he sank into unconsciousness he knew the answer.\n  \n \n  The suit's Kendall-shield had leaked!\n  \n \n  Four plunged toward Venus tail first, the Hoskins jets flaring ahead.\nThe single doctor for the Colony had gone out in Two and the crewmen\ntrained in first aid could do little to relieve Barry's distress.\nFainting spells alternated with fever and delirium and an unquenchable\nthirst. His breathing became increasingly difficult.\n  \n \n  A few thousand miles out Four picked up a microbeam. A feeling of\nexultation surged through the ship as Captain Reno passed the word, for\nthe beam meant that some Earthmen were alive upon Venus. They were not\nnecessarily diving straight toward oblivion. Barry, sick as he was,\nfelt the thrill of the unknown world that lay ahead.\n  \n \n  Into a miles-thick layer of opacity Four roared, with Captain Reno\nhimself jockeying throttles to keep it balanced on its self-created\nsupport of flame.\n  \n \n  \"You're almost in,\" a voice chanted into his headphones through\ncrackling, sizzling static. \"Easy toward spherical one-thirty. Hold it!\nLower. Lower. CUT YOUR POWER!\"\n  \n \n  The heavy hull dropped sickeningly, struck with a mushy thud, settled,\nsteadied.\n  \n \n  Barry was weak, but with Nick Podtiaguine steadying him he was waiting\nwith the others when Captain Reno gave the last order.\n  \n \n  \"Airlock open. Both doors.\"\n  \n \n  Venusian air poured in.\n  \n \n  \"For this I left Panama?\" one of the men yelped.\n  \n \n  \"Enough to gag a maggot,\" another agreed with hand to nose.\n  \n \n  It was like mid-summer noon in a tropical mangrove swamp, hot and\nunbearably humid and overpowering with the stench of decaying\nvegetation.\n  \n \n  But Barry took one deep breath, then another. The stabbing needles in\nhis chest blunted, and the choking band around his throat loosened.\n  \n \n  The outer door swung wide. He blinked, and a shift in the encompassing\nvapors gave him his first sight of a world bathed in subdued light.\n  \n \n  Four had landed in a marsh with the midships lock only a few feet above\na quagmire surface still steaming from the final rocket blast. Nearby\nthe identical hulls of Two and Three stood upright in the mud. The\nmist shifted again and beyond the swamp he could see the low, rounded\noutlines of the collapsible buildings Two and Three had carried in\ntheir cargo pits. They were set on a rock ledge rising a few feet out\nof the marsh. The Colony!\n  \n \n  Men were tossing sections of lattice duckboard out upon the swamp,\nextending a narrow walkway toward Four's airlock, and within a few\nminutes the new arrivals were scrambling down.\n  \n \n  Barry paid little attention to the noisy greetings and excited talk.\nImpatiently he trotted toward the rock ledge, searching for one\nparticular figure among the men and women who waited.\n  \n \n  \"Dorothy!\" he said fervently.\n  \n \n  Then his arms were around her and she was responding to his kiss.\n  \n \n  Then unexpected pain tore at his chest. Her lovely face took on an\nexpression of fright even as it wavered and grew dim. The last thing he\nsaw was Robson Hind looming beside her.\n  \n \n  By the glow of an overhead tubelight he recognized the kindly, deeply\nlined features of the man bending over him. Dr. Carl Jensen, specialist\nin tropical diseases. He tried to sit up but the doctor laid a\nrestraining hand on his shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Water!\" Barry croaked.\n  \n \n  The doctor held out a glass. Then his eyes widened incredulously as his\npatient deliberately drew in a breath while drinking, sucking water\ndirectly into his lungs.\n  \n \n  \"Doctor,\" he asked, keeping his voice low to spare his throat. \"What\nare my chances? On the level.\"\n  \n \n  Dr. Jensen shook his head thoughtfully. \"There's not a thing\u2014not a\ndamned solitary thing\u2014I can do. It's something new to medical science.\"\n  \n \n  Barry lay still.\n  \n \n  \"Your body is undergoing certain radical changes,\" the doctor\ncontinued, \"and you know as much\u2014more about your condition than I do.\nIf a normal person who took water into his lungs that way didn't die of\na coughing spasm, congestive pneumonia would get him sure. But it seems\nto give you relief.\"\n  \n \n  Barry scratched his neck, where a thickened, darkening patch on each\nside itched infuriatingly.\n  \n \n  \"What are these changes?\" he asked. \"What's this?\"\n  \n \n  \"Those things seem to be\u2014\" the doctor began hesitantly. \"Damn it, I\nknow it sounds crazy but they're rudimentary gills.\"\n  \n \n  Barry accepted the outrageous statement unemotionally. He was beyond\nshock.\n  \n \n  \"But there must be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Pain struck again, so intense his body twisted and arched\ninvoluntarily. Then the prick of a needle brought merciful oblivion.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Barry's mind was working furiously. The changes the Sigma radiations\nhad inflicted upon his body might reverse themselves spontaneously, Dr.\nJensen had mentioned during a second visit\u2014but for that to happen he\nmust remain alive. That meant easing all possible strains.\n  \n \n  When the doctor came in again Barry asked him to find Nick Podtiaguine.\nWithin a few minutes the mechanic appeared.\n  \n \n  \"Cheez, it's good to see you, Barry,\" he began.\n  \n \n  \"Stuff it,\" the sick man interrupted. \"I want favors. Can do?\"\n  \n \n  Nick nodded vigorously.\n  \n \n  \"First cut that air conditioner and get the window open.\"\n  \n \n  Nick stared as though he were demented, but obeyed, unbolting the heavy\nplastic window panel and lifting it aside. He made a face at the damp,\nmalodorous Venusian air but to Barry it brought relief.\n  \n \n  It was not enough, but it indicated he was on the right track. And he\nwas not an engineer for nothing.\n  \n \n  \"Got a pencil?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  He drew only a rough sketch, for Nick was far too competent to need\ndetailed drawings.\n  \n \n  \"Think you can get materials?\"\n  \n \n  Nick glanced at the sketch. \"Hell, man, for you I can get anything the\nColony has. You saved Four and everybody knows it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two days?\"\n  \n \n  Nick looked insulted.\n  \n \n  He was back in eight hours, and with him came a dozen helpers. A\npower line and water tube were run through the metal partition to the\ncorridor, connections were made, and the machine Barry had sketched was\nready.\n  \n \n  Nick flipped the switch. The thing whined shrilly. From a fanshaped\nnozzle came innumerable droplets of water, droplets of colloidal size\nthat hung in the air and only slowly coalesced into larger drops that\nfell toward the metal floor.\n  \n \n  Barry nodded, a smile beginning to spread across his drawn features.\n  \n \n  \"Perfect. Now put the window back.\"\n  \n \n  Outside lay the unknown world of Venus, and an open, unguarded window\nmight invite disaster.\n  \n \n  A few hours later Dr. Jensen found his patient in a normal sleep. The\nroom was warm and the air was so filled with water-mist it was almost\nliquid. Coalescing drops dripped from the walls and curving ceiling\nand furniture, from the half clad body of the sleeping man, and the\nscavenger pump made greedy gulping sounds as it removed excess water\nfrom the floor.\n  \n \n  The doctor shook his head as he backed out, his clothes clinging wet\nfrom the short exposure.\n  \n \n  It was abnormal.\n  \n \n  But so was Barry Barr.\n  \n \n  With breathing no longer a continuous agony Barry began to recover some\nof his strength. But for several days much of his time was spent in\nsleep and Dorothy Voorhees haunted his dreams.\n  \n \n  Whenever he closed his eyes he could see her as clearly as though\nshe were with him\u2014her face with the exotic high cheek-bones\u2014her\neyes a deep gray in fascinating contrast to her raven hair\u2014lips that\nseemed to promise more of giving than she had ever allowed herself to\nfulfil\u2014her incongruously pert, humorous little nose that was a legacy\nfrom some venturesome Irishman\u2014her slender yet firmly lithe body.\n  \n \n  After a few days Dr. Jensen permitted him to have visitors. They came\nin a steady stream, the people from Four and men he had not seen since\nTraining Base days, and although none could endure his semi-liquid\natmosphere more than a few minutes at a time Barry enjoyed their visits.\n  \n \n  But the person for whom he waited most anxiously did not arrive. At\neach knock Barry's heart would leap, and each time he settled back with\na sigh of disappointment. Days passed and still Dorothy did not come\nto him. He could not go to her, and stubborn pride kept him from even\ninquiring. All the while he was aware of Robson Hind's presence in the\nColony, and only weakness kept him from pacing his room like a caged\nanimal.\n  \n \n  Through his window he could see nothing but the gradual brightening\nand darkening of the enveloping fog as the slow 82-hour Venusian day\nprogressed, but from his visitors' words he learned something of\nVenusian conditions and the story of the Colony.\n  \n \n  Number One had bumbled in on visual, the pilot depending on the smeary\nimages of infra-sight goggles. An inviting grassy plain had proved to\nbe a layer of algae floating on quicksand. Frantically the crew had\nblasted down huge balsa-like marsh trees, cutting up the trunks with\nflame guns to make crude rafts. They had performed fantastic feats of\nstrength and endurance but managed to salvage only half their equipment\nbefore the shining nose of One had vanished in the gurgling ooze.\n  \n \n  Lost in a steaming, stinking marsh teeming with alien creatures that\nslithered and crawled and swam and flew, blinded by the eternal fog,\nthe crew had proved the rightness of their choice as pioneers. For\nweeks they had floundered across the deadly terrain until at last,\nbeside a stagnant-looking slough that drained sluggishly into a warm,\nalmost tideless sea a mile away, they had discovered an outcropping of\nrock. It was the only solid ground they had encountered.\n  \n \n  One man had died, his swamp suit pierced by a poisonous thorn, but the\nothers had hand-hauled the radio beacon piece by piece and set it up\nin time to guide Two to a safe landing. Houses had been assembled, the\nsecondary power units of the spaceship put to work, and the colony had\nestablished a tenuous foothold.\n  \n \n  Three had landed beside Two a few months later, bringing\nreinforcements, but the day-by-day demands of the little colony's\nstruggle for survival had so far been too pressing to permit extended\nor detailed explorations. Venus remained a planet of unsolved mysteries.\n  \n \n  The helicopter brought out in Three had made several flights which\nby radar and sound reflection had placed vague outlines on the blank\nmaps. The surface appeared to be half water, with land masses mainly\njungle-covered swamp broken by a few rocky ledges, but landings away\nfrom base had been judged too hazardous.\n  \n \n  Test borings from the ledge had located traces of oil and radioactive\nminerals, while enough Venusian plants had proven edible to provide an\nadequate though monotonous food source.\n  \n \n  Venus was the diametric opposite of lifeless Mars. Through the fog\ngigantic insects hummed and buzzed like lost airplanes, but fortunately\nthey were harmless and timid.\n  \n \n  In the swamps wildly improbable life forms grew and reproduced and\nfought and died, and many of those most harmless in appearance\npossessed surprisingly venomous characteristics.\n  \n \n  The jungle had been flamed away in a huge circle around the colony to\nminimize the chances of surprise by anything that might attack, but the\nblasting was an almost continuous process. The plants of Venus grew\nwith a vigor approaching fury.\n  \n \n  Most spectacular of the Venusian creatures were the amphibious armored\nmonsters, saurian or semi-saurians with a slight resemblance to the\nbrontosauri that had once lived on Earth, massive swamp-dwellers that\nused the slough beside the colony's ledge as a highway. They were\napparently vegetarians, but thorough stupidity in tremendous bulk made\nthem dangerous. One had damaged a building by blundering against it,\nand since then the colony had remained alert, using weapons to repel\nthe beasts.\n  \n \n  The most important question\u2014that of the presence or absence of\nintelligent, civilized Venusians\u2014remained unanswered. Some of the men\nreported a disquieting feeling of being watched, particularly when near\nopen water, but others argued that any intelligent creatures would have\nestablished contact.\n  \n"

        "  THE LOST TRIBES OF VENUS\n  \n \n  By ERIK FENNEL\n  \n \n \n   On mist-shrouded Venus, where hostile\n    \n   swamp meets hostile sea ... there did\n    \n   Barry Barr\u2014Earthman transmuted\u2014swap\n    \n   his Terran heritage for the deep dark\n    \n   waters of Tana; for the strangely\n    \n   beautiful Xintel of the blue-brown skin.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories May 1954.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Evil luck brought the meteorite to those particular space-time\ncoordinates as Number Four rode the downhill spiral toward Venus. The\nfootball-sized chunk of nickel-iron and rock overtook the ship at a\nrelative speed of only a few hundred miles per hour and passed close\nenough to come within the tremendous pseudo-gravatic fields of the\nidling drivers.\n  \n \n  It swerved into a paraboloid course, following the flux lines, and was\ndragged directly against one of the three projecting nozzles. Energy\nof motion was converted to heat and a few meteoric fragments fused\nthemselves to the nonmetallic tube casing.\n  \n \n  In the jet room the positronic line accelerator for that particular\ndriver fouled under the intolerable overload, and the backsurge sent\nsearing heat and deadly radiation blasting through the compartment\nbefore the main circuit breakers could clack open.\n  \n \n  The bellow of the alarm horn brought Barry Barr fully awake, shattering\na delightfully intimate dream of the dark haired girl he hoped to see\nagain soon in Venus Colony. As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started\naft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly\nthat Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers.\n  \n \n  Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet\nroom door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was\nmanipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One\nby one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence.\n  \n \n  The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable\nconditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open.\nQuickly the commander entered the blasted jet room. Barry Barr was\nclose behind him.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind, jet chief of Four and electronics expert for Venus Colony,\nhung back until others had gone in first. His handsome, heavy face had\nlost its usual ruddiness.\n  \n \n  Captain Reno surveyed the havoc. Young Ryan's body floated eerily in\nthe zero gravity, charred into instant death by the back-blast. The\nline accelerator was a shapeless ruin, but except for broken meter\nglasses and scorched control handles other mechanical damage appeared\nminor. They had been lucky.\n  \n \n  \"Turnover starts in six hours twelve minutes,\" the captain said\nmeaningfully.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind cleared his throat. \"We can change accelerators in two\nhours,\" he declared. With a quick reassumption of authority he began to\norder his crew into action.\n  \n \n  It took nearer three hours than two to change accelerators despite\nHind's shouted orders.\n  \n \n  At last the job was completed. Hind made a final check, floated over to\nthe control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he\nthrew in the accelerator switch.\n  \n \n  The meter needles climbed, soared past the red lines without pausing,\nand just in time to prevent a second blowback, Hind cut the power.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   There's metal in the field!\n   \n  \" His voice was high and unsteady.\n  \n<doc-sep>The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n  \n \n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n  \n \n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\n   \n   varpa\n   \n  cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n  \n \n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the\nobject of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.\n  \n \n  \"Green Flames, eh?\" he repeated slowly. \"Well yes, I suppose I could\nfind that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a\ncigarette. \"You know where it is, don't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ye-s,\" Karn nodded. \"But like I told you before, that ship lies in\nVarsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.\"\n  \n \n  \"What are the Varsoom?\" I asked. \"A native tribe?\"\n  \n \n  Karn shook his head. \"They're a form of life that's never been seen by\nEarthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside\nof myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away\nbecause I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped\nbecause he made 'em laugh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Laugh?\" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" Karn said. \"The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction\nthat's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them\nlaugh, I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.\nSeveral mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the\nVenusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.\n  \n \n  \"The Doctor Universe program,\" he said. \"I ain't missed one in months.\nYou gotta wait 'til I hear it.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He\nflipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a\nchair, listening with avid interest.\n  \n \n  It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I\nheard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once\nagain I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back\nand forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi\nscreen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead\nmy thoughts far away.\n  \n<doc-sep>class=\"chap\"/>\n  \n  2.\n  \n \n  If you have explored the weird life of many a planet, as I have, you\ncan appreciate the deep sense of excitement that comes over me when,\nlooking out at a new world for the first time, I see a man-like animal.\n  \n \n  Walking upright!\n  \n \n  Wearing adornments in the nature of clothing!\n  \n \n  I gazed, and my lungs filled with the breath of wonderment. A man!\nAcross millions of miles of space\u2014a man, like the men of the Earth.\n  \n \n  Six times before in my life of exploration I had gazed at new realms\nwithin the approachable parts of our universe, but never before had the\nliving creatures borne such wonderful resemblance to the human life of\nour Earth.\n  \n \n  A man!\n  \n \n  He might have been creeping on all fours.\n  \n \n  He might have been skulking like a lesser animal.\n  \n \n  He might have been entirely naked.\n  \n \n  He was none of these\u2014and at the very first moment of viewing him I\nfelt a kinship toward him. Oh, he was primitive in appearance\u2014but had\nmy ancestors not been the same? Was this not a mirror of my own race\na million years or so ago? I sensed that my own stream of life had\nsomehow crossed with his in ages gone by. How? Who can ever know? By\nwhat faded charts of the movements through the sky will man ever be\nable to retrace relationships of forms of life among planets?\n  \n \n  \"Get ready to go out and meet him, Campbell,\" I said. \"He's a friend.\"\n  \n \n  Split Campbell gave me a look as if to say, Sir, you don't even know\nwhat sort of animal he is, actually, much less whether he's friendly or\nmurderous.\n  \n \n  \"There are some things I can sense on first sight, Campbell. Take my\nword for it, he's a friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't say anything, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Don't. Just get ready.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're going to go\n   \n   out\n   \n  \u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" I said. \"Orders.\"\n  \n \n  \"And meet both of them?\" Split was at the telescope.\n  \n \n  \"Both?\" I took the instrument from him. Both! \"Well!\"\n  \n \n  \"They seem to be coming out of the ground,\" Split said. \"I see no signs\nof habitation, but apparently we've landed on top of an underground\ncity\u2014though I hasten to add that this is only an hypothesis.\"\n  \n \n  \"One's a male and the other's a female,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"Another hypothesis,\" said Split.\n  \n \n  The late evening sunshine gave us a clear view of our two \"friends\".\nThey were fully a mile away. Split was certain they had not seen our\nship, and to this conclusion I was in agreement. They had apparently\ncome up out of the barren rock hillside to view the sunset. I studied\nthem through the telescope while Split checked over equipment for a\nhike.\n  \n \n  The man's walk was unhurried. He moved thoughtfully, one might\nguess. His bare chest and legs showed him to be statuesque in mold,\ncleanly muscled, fine of bone. His skin was almost the color of the\ncream-colored robe which flowed from his back, whipping lightly in\nthe breeze. He wore a brilliant red sash about his middle, and this\nwas matched by a red headdress that came down over his shoulders as a\ncircular mantle.\n  \n \n  The girl stood several yards distant, watching him. This was some\nsort of ritual, no doubt. He was not concerned with her, but with the\nsetting sun. Its rays were almost horizontal, knifing through a break\nin the distant mountain skyline. He went through some routine motions,\nhis moving arms highlighted by the lemon-colored light of evening.\n  \n \n  The girl approached him. Two other persons appeared from somewhere back\nof her.... Three.... Four.... Five....\n  \n \n  \"Where do they come from?\" Split had paused in the act of checking\nequipment to take his turn at the telescope. If he had not done so, I\nmight not have made a discovery. The landscape was\n   \n   moving\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The long shadows that I had not noticed through the telescope were a\nprominent part of the picture I saw through the ship's window when I\nlooked out across the scene with the naked eye. The shadows were moving.\n  \n \n  They were tree shadows. They were moving toward the clearing where the\ncrowd gathered. And the reason for their movement was that the trees\nthemselves were moving.\n  \n \n  \"Notice anything?\" I asked Split.\n  \n \n  \"The crowd is growing. We've certainly landed on top of a city.\" He\ngazed. \"They're coming from underground.\"\n  \n \n  Looking through the telescope, obviously he didn't catch the view of\nthe moving trees.\n  \n \n  \"Notice anything else unusual?\" I persisted.\n  \n \n  \"Yes. The females\u2014I'm speaking hypothetically\u2014but they\n   \n   must\n   \n  be\nfemales\u2014are all wearing puffy white fur ornaments around their elbows.\nI wonder why?\"\n  \n \n  \"You haven't noticed the trees?\"\n  \n \n  \"The females are quite attractive,\" said Split.\n  \n \n  I forgot about the moving trees, then, and took over the telescope.\nMobile trees were not new to me. I had seen similar vegetation on other\nplanets\u2014\"sponge-trees\"\u2014which possessed a sort of muscular quality. If\nthese were similar, they were no doubt feeding along the surface of the\nslope below the rocky plateau. The people in the clearing beyond paid\nno attention to them.\n  \n \n  I studied the crowd of people. Only the leader wore the brilliant garb.\nThe others were more scantily clothed. All were handsome of build. The\nlemon-tinted sunlight glanced off the muscular shoulders of the males\nand the soft curves of the females.\n  \n \n  \"Those furry elbow ornaments on the females,\" I said to Split,\n\"they're for protection. The caves they live in must be narrow, so\nthey pad their elbows.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't they pad their shoulders? They don't have anything on their\nshoulders.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you complaining?\"\n  \n \n  We became fascinated in watching, from the seclusion of our ship. If we\nwere to walk out, or make any sounds, we might have interrupted their\nmeeting. Here they were in their native ritual of sunset, not knowing\nthat people from another world watched. The tall leader must be making\na speech. They sat around him in little huddles. He moved his arms in\ncalm, graceful gestures.\n  \n \n  \"They'd better break it up!\" Split said suddenly. \"The jungles are\nmoving in on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're spellbound,\" I said. \"They're used to sponge-trees. Didn't you\never see moving trees?\"\n  \n \n  Split said sharply, \"Those trees are marching! They're an army under\ncover. Look!\"\n  \n \n  I saw, then. The whole line of advancing vegetation was camouflage for\na sneak attack. And all those natives sitting around in meeting were as\ninnocent as a flock of sitting ducks.

The\nfootball-sized chunk of nickel-iron and rock overtook the ship at a\nrelative speed of only a few hundred miles per hour and passed close\nenough to come within the tremendous pseudo-gravatic fields of the\nidling drivers.\n  \n \n  It swerved into a paraboloid course, following the flux lines, and was\ndragged directly against one of the three projecting nozzles.

As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started\naft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly\nthat Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers.\n  \n \n  Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet\nroom door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was\nmanipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One\nby one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence.\n  \n \n  The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable\nconditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open.\nQuickly the commander entered the blasted jet room. Barry Barr was\nclose behind him.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind, jet chief of Four and electronics expert for Venus Colony,\nhung back until others had gone in first. His handsome, heavy face had\nlost its usual ruddiness.\n  \n \n  Captain Reno surveyed the havoc. Young Ryan's body floated eerily in\nthe zero gravity, charred into instant death by the back-blast. The\nline accelerator was a shapeless ruin, but except for broken meter\nglasses and scorched control handles other mechanical damage appeared\nminor. They had been lucky.\n  \n \n  \"Turnover starts in six hours twelve minutes,\" the captain said\nmeaningfully.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind cleared his throat. \"We can change accelerators in two\nhours,\" he declared. With a quick reassumption of authority he began to\norder his crew into action.\n  \n \n  It took nearer three hours than two to change accelerators despite\nHind's shouted orders.\n  \n \n  At last the job was completed. Hind made a final check, floated over to\nthe control panel and started the fuel feed. With a confident smile he\nthrew in the accelerator switch.\n  \n \n  The meter needles climbed, soared past the red lines without pausing,\nand just in time to prevent a second blowback, Hind cut the power.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   There's metal in the field!\n   \n  \" His voice was high and unsteady.\n  \n<doc-sep>The blazing disc of Sol, the minor globes of the planets, the unwinking\npinpoints of the stars, all stared with cosmic disinterest at the tiny\nfigure crawling along the hull. His spacesuit trapped and amplified\nbreathing and heartbeats into a roaring chaos that was an invitation\nto blind panic, and all the while there was consciousness of the\ninsidiously deadly Sigma radiations.\n  \n \n  Barry found the debris of the meteorite, an ugly shining splotch\nagainst the dull superceramic tube, readied his power chisel, started\ncutting. Soon it became a tedious, torturingly strenuous manual task\nrequiring little conscious thought, and Barry's mind touched briefly on\nthe events that had brought him here.\n  \n \n  First Luna, and that had been murderous. Man had encountered Sigma\nfor the first time, and many had died before the Kendall-shield was\nperfected. And the chemical-fueled rockets of those days had been\ninherently poor.\n  \n \n  Hoskins semi-atomics had made possible the next step\u2014to Mars. But men\nhad found Mars barren, swept clear of all life in the cataclysm that\nhad shattered the trans-Martian planet to form the Asteroid Belt.\n  \n \n  Venus, its true surface forever hidden by enshrouding mists, had been\nwell within one-way range. But Hoskins fuel requirements for a round\ntrip added up to something beyond critical mass. Impossible.\n  \n \n  But the Five Ship Plan had evolved, a joint enterprise of government\nand various private groups. Five vessels were to go out, each fueled\nto within a whiskered neutron of spontaneous detonation, manned by\nspecialists who, it was hoped, could maintain themselves under alien\nconditions.\n  \n \n  On Venus the leftover fuel from all five would be transferred to\nwhichever ship had survived the outbound voyage in best condition.\nThat one would return to Earth. Permanent base or homeward voyage with\ncolonists crowded aboard like defeated sardines? Only time would tell.\n  \n \n  Barry Barr had volunteered, and because the enlightened guesses of the\nexperts called for men and women familiar with tropical conditions,\nhe had survived the rigorous weeding-out process. His duties in Venus\nColony would be to refabricate the discarded ships into whatever form\nwas most needed\u2014most particularly a launching ramp\u2014and to study\nnative Venusian materials.\n  \n \n  Dorothy Voorhees had signed on as toxicologist and dietician. When the\nlimited supply of Earth food ran out the Colony would be forced to\nrely upon Venusian plants and animals. She would guard against subtle\ndelayed-action poisons, meanwhile devising ways of preparing Venusian\nmaterials to suit Earth tastes and digestions.\n  \n \n  Barry had met her at Training Base and known at once that his years of\nloneliness had come to an end.\n  \n \n  She seemed utterly independent, self-contained, completely intellectual\ndespite her beauty, but Barry had not been deceived. From the moment\nof first meeting he had sensed within her deep springs of suppressed\nemotion, and he had understood. He too had come up the hard way, alone,\nand been forced to develop a shell of hardness and cold, single-minded\ndevotion to his work. Gradually, often unwillingly under his\ninsistence, her aloofness had begun to melt.\n  \n \n  But Robson Hind too had been attracted. He was the only son of the\nbusiness manager of the great Hoskins Corporation which carried\na considerable share in the Five Ship Plan. Dorothy's failure to\nvirtually fall into his arms had only piqued his desires.\n  \n \n  The man's smooth charm had fascinated the girl and his money had opened\nto her an entirely new world of lavish nightclubs and extravagantly\nexpensive entertainments, but her inborn shrewdness had sensed some\nfactor in his personality that had made her hesitate.\n  \n \n  Barry had felt a distrust of Hind apart from the normal dislike of\nrivalry. He had looked forward to being with Dorothy aboard Three, and\nhad made no secret of his satisfaction when Hind's efforts to have\nhimself transferred to Three also or the girl to Four had failed.\n  \n \n  But then a scaffold had slipped while Three was being readied, and with\na fractured ankle he had been forced to miss the ship.\n  \n \n  He unclipped the magnetic detector from his belt and ran it inch by\ninch over the nozzle. He found one spot of metal, pinhead-sized, but\nenough to cause trouble, and once more swung his power chisel into\nstuttering action.\n  \n \n  Then it was done.\n  \n \n  As quickly as possible he inched back to the airlock. Turnover had to\nstart according to calculations.\n  \n<doc-sep>Barry developed definite external signs of what the Sigma radiation had\ndone to him. The skin between his fingers and toes spread, grew into\nmembranous webs. The swellings in his neck became more pronounced and\ndark parallel lines appeared.\n  \n \n  But despite the doctor's pessimistic reports that the changes had not\nstopped, Barry continued to tell himself he was recovering. He had\nto believe and keep on believing to retain sanity in the face of the\nweird, unclassifiable feelings that surged through his body. Still\nhe was subject to fits of almost suicidal depression, and Dorothy's\nfailure to visit him did not help his mental condition.\n  \n \n  Then one day he woke from a nap and thought he was still dreaming.\nDorothy was leaning over him.\n  \n \n  \"Barry! Barry!\" she whispered. \"I can't help it. I love you even if you\ndo have a wife and child in Philadelphia. I know it's wrong but all\nthat seems so far away it doesn't matter any more.\" Tears glistened in\nher eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\" he grunted. \"Who? Me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, Barry, don't lie. She wrote to me before Three blasted\noff\u2014oh, the most piteous letter!\"\n  \n \n  Barry was fully awake now. \"I'm not married. I have no child.\nI've never been in Philadelphia,\" he shouted. His lips thinned.\n\"I\u2014think\u2014I\u2014know\u2014who\u2014wrote\u2014that\u2014letter!\" he declared grimly.\n  \n \n  \"Robson wouldn't!\" she objected, shocked, but there was a note of doubt\nin her voice.\n  \n \n  Then she was in his arms, sobbing openly.\n  \n \n  \"I believe you, Barry.\"\n  \n \n  She stayed with him for hours, and she had changed since the days\nat Training Base. Long months away from the patterned restraints of\ncivilization, living each day on the edge of unknown perils, had\nawakened in her the realization that she was a human being and a\nwoman, as well as a toxicologist.\n  \n \n  When the water-mist finally forced her departure she left Barry joyous\nand confident of his eventual recovery. For a few minutes anger\nsimmered in his brain as he contemplated the pleasure of rearranging\nRobson Hind's features.\n  \n \n  The accident with the scaffold had been remarkably convenient, but\nthis time the ruthless, restless, probably psychopathic drive that had\nmade Robson Hind more than just another rich man's spoiled son had\ncarried him too far. Barry wondered whether it had been inefficiency or\njudiciously distributed money that had made the psychometrists overlook\nsome undesirable traits in Hind's personality in accepting him for the\nFive Ship Plan.\n  \n \n  But even with his trickery Hind had lost.\n  \n \n  He slept, and woke with a feeling of doom.\n  \n \n  The slow Venusian twilight had ended in blackness and the overhead\ntubelight was off.\n  \n \n  He sat up, and apprehension gave way to burning torture in his chest.\n  \n \n  Silence! He fumbled for the light switch, then knelt beside the mist\nmachine that no longer hummed. Power and water supplies were both dead,\ncut off outside his room.\n  \n \n  Floating droplets were merging and falling to the floor. Soon the air\nwould be dry, and he would be choking and strangling. He turned to call\nfor help.\n  \n \n  The door was locked!\n  \n \n  He tugged and the knob came away in his hand. The retaining screw had\nbeen removed.\n  \n \n  He beat upon the panel, first with his fists and then with the metal\ndoorknob, but the insulation between the double alloy sheets was\nefficient soundproofing. Furiously he hurled himself upon it, only to\nbounce back with a bruised shoulder. He was trapped.\n  \n \n  Working against time and eventual death he snatched a metal chair\nand swung with all his force at the window, again, again, yet again.\nA small crack appeared in the transparent plastic, branched under\ncontinued hammering, became a rough star. He gathered his waning\nstrength, then swung once more. The tough plastic shattered.\n  \n \n  He tugged at the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame. Fog-laden\nVenusian air poured in\u2014but it was not enough!\n  \n \n  He dragged himself head first through the narrow opening, landed\nsprawling on hands and knees in the darkness. In his ears a confused\nrustling drone from the alien swamp mingled with the roar of\napproaching unconsciousness.\n  \n \n  There was a smell in his nostrils. The smell of water. He lurched\nforward at a shambling run, stumbling over the uneven ground.\n  \n \n  Then he plunged from the rocky ledge into the slough. Flashes of\ncolored light flickered before his eyes as he went under. But Earth\nhabits were still strong; instinctively he held his breath.\n  \n \n  Then he fainted. Voluntary control of his body vanished. His mouth hung\nslack and the breathing reflex that had been an integral part of his\nlife since the moment of birth forced him to inhale.\n  \n \n  Bubbles floated upward and burst. Then Barry Barr was lying in the ooze\nof the bottom. And he was breathing, extracting vital oxygen from the\nbrackish, silt-clouded water.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Slowly his racing heartbeat returned to normal. Gradually he became\naware of the stench of decaying plants and of musky taints he knew\ninstinctively were the scents of underwater animals. Then with a shock\nthe meaning became clear. He had become a water-breather, cut off from\nall other Earthmen, no longer entirely human. His fellows in the colony\nwere separated from him now by a gulf more absolute than the airless\nvoid between Earth and Venus.\n  \n \n  Something slippery and alive touched him near one armpit. He opened\nhis eyes in the black water and his groping hand clutched something\nburrowing into his skin. With a shudder of revulsion he crushed a fat\nworm between his fingers.\n  \n \n  Then dozens of them\u2014hundreds\u2014were upon him from all sides. He was\nwearing only a pair of khaki pants but the worms ignored his chest to\ncongregate around his face, intent on attacking the tender skin of his\neyelids.\n  \n \n  For a minute his flailing hands fought them off, but they came in\nincreasing numbers and clung like leeches. Pain spread as they bit and\nburrowed, and blindly he began to swim.\n  \n \n  Faster and faster. He could sense the winding banks of the slough and\nkept to midchannel, swimming with his eyes tightly closed. One by one\nthe worms dropped off.\n  \n \n  He stopped, opened his eyes, not on complete darkness this time but on\na faint blue-green luminescence from far below. The water was saltier\nhere, and clearer.\n  \n \n  He had swum down the slough and out into the ocean. He tried to turn\nback, obsessed by a desire to be near the colony even though he\ncould not go ashore without strangling, but he had lost all sense of\ndirection.\n  \n \n  He was still weak and his lungs were not completely adjusted to\nunderwater life. Again he grew dizzy and faint. The slow movements of\nhands and feet that held him just below the surface grew feeble and\nceased. He sank.\n  \n \n  Down into dimly luminous water he dropped, and with his respiratory\nsystem completely water-filled there was no sensation of pressure. At\nlast he floated gently to the bottom and lay motionless.\n  \n \n  Shouting voices awakened him, an exultant battle cry cutting through a\ngasping scream of anguish. Streaks of bright orange light were moving\ntoward him in a twisting pattern. At the head of each trail was a\nfigure. A human figure that weaved and swam in deadly moving combat.\nOne figure drifted limply bottomward.\n  \n \n  Hallucination, Barry told himself. Then one of the figures broke from\nthe group. Almost overhead it turned sharply downward and the feet\nmoved in a powerful flutter-kick. A slender spear aimed directly at the\nEarthman.\n  \n \n  Barry threw himself aside. The spear point plunged deep into the\nsticky, yielding bottom and Barry grappled with its wielder.\n  \n \n  Pointed fingernails raked his cheek. Barry's balled fist swung\nin a roundhouse blow but water resistance slowed the punch to\nineffectiveness. The creature only shook its head and came in kicking\nand clawing.\n  \n \n  Barry braced his feet against the bottom and leaped. His head butted\nthe attacker's chest and at the same instant he lashed a short jab to\nthe creature's belly. It slumped momentarily, its face working.\n  \n \n  Human\u2014or nearly so\u2014the thing was, with a stocky, powerful body and\nwebbed hands and feet. A few scraps of clothing, seemingly worn more\nfor ornament than covering, clung to the fishbelly-white skin. The face\nwas coarse and savage.\n  \n \n  It shook off the effects of Barry's punch and one webbed hand snatched\na short tube from its belt.\n  \n \n  Barry remembered the spring-opening knife in his pocket, and even as\nhe flicked the blade out the tube-weapon fired. Sound thrummed in the\nwater and the water grew milky with a myriad of bubbles. Something\nzipped past his head, uncomfortably close.\n  \n \n  Then Barry struck, felt his knife slice flesh and grate against bone.\nHe struck again even as the undersea being screamed and went limp.\n  \n \n  Barry stared through the reddening water.\n  \n \n  Another figure plunged toward him. Barry jerked the dead Venusian's\nspear from the mud and raised it defensively.\n  \n \n  But the figure paid no attention. This one was a female who fled\ndesperately from two men closing in from opposite sides. One threw his\nspear, using an odd pushing motion, and as she checked and dodged, the\nother was upon her from behind.\n  \n \n  One arm went around her neck in a strangler's hold, bending her slender\nbody backward. Together captor and struggling captive sank toward the\nbottom. The other recovered his thrown spear and moved in to help\nsecure her arms and legs with lengths of cord.\n  \n \n  One scooped up the crossbow the girl had dropped. The other ripped at\nher brief skirt and from her belt took a pair of tubes like the one the\ndead Venusian had fired at Barry, handling them as though they were\nloot of the greatest value. He jerked cruelly at the slender metallic\nnecklace the girl wore but it did not break.\n  \n \n  He punched the helpless girl in the abdomen with the butt of his spear.\nThe girl writhed but she did not attempt to cry out.\n  \n \n  Barry bounded toward them in a series of soaring leaps, knife and spear\nready. One Venusian turned to meet him, grinning maliciously.\n  \n \n  Barry dug one foot into the bottom and sidestepped a spear thrust. His\nown lunge missed completely. Then he and the Venusian were inside each\nother's spear points, chest to chest. A pointed hook strapped to the\ninside of the creature's wrist just missed Barry's throat. The Earthman\narched his body backward and his knife flashed upward. The creature\ngasped and pulled away, clutching with both hands at a gaping wound in\nits belly.\n  \n \n  The other one turned too late as Barry leaped.\n  \n \n  Barry's hilt cracked against its jawbone.\n  \n"

The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from\nthe Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned\nproton-rifles slung over their backs.

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base.

Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\"\n  \n \n  \"The same.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's\na prize stinker ... but you were in command of the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . And,\nafter all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come\nthis?\" He indicated the monitor expressively.\n  \n \n  Strike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with\nme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you\nwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp\noperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy with\ntradition.\n  \n \n  \"The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polish\nimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and Congressional\nMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in the\nabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a United\nNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...\nme.\n  \n \n  \"From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But something\nhappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest of\nthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.\n  \n \n  \"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the\nwrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too\nmuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  because I left my station where I was supposed to be running\nsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in\ndanger....\"\n  \n \n  \"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob.\n  \n \n  \"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical\nastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my\nroutine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No\nnova. I made an ass of myself and lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . Gorman gave it\nto his former aide. I got this.\"\n  \n \n  Cob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me again. The\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.\nWe celebrated a bit too freely.\"\n  \n \n  Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night\nafter the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,\nwasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\"\n  \n \n  \"Canalopolis?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded.\n  \n \n  \"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian\nEmbassy Ball.\"\n  \n \n  \"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Strike's the name, Cob.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like\nour old tin pot here.\" He patted the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  nether belly\naffectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to\nmeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\"\n  \n \n  Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . \"She'll\ncarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket\nfuel, anyway. Deep space?\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Cob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run. Hot work.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.\n\"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.\"\n  \n \n  Cob nodded agreement. \"The last of her class.\"\n  \n"

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Both men began scooping sand in their cupped hands, digging frantically\nfor the book. Saliva dripped from Maota's mouth, but he didn't know or\ncare.\n  \n \n  Finally they stopped, exhausted. They had covered a substantial area\naround the hole. They had covered the complete area where they had been.\n  \n \n  \"We killed it,\" the old man moaned.\n  \n \n  \"It was just a book. Not alive, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"How do you know?\" The old man's pale eyes were filled with tears. \"It\ntalked and it sang. In a way, it had a soul. Sometimes on long nights I\nused to imagine it loved me, for taking care of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"There are other books. We'll get another.\"\n  \n \n  Maota shook his head. \"There are no more.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I've seen them. Down there in the square building.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not poetry. Books, yes, but not poetry. That was the only book with\nsongs.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You\n   \n  killed it!\" Maota suddenly sprang for the weapon, lying\nforgotten in the sand. Michaelson put his foot on it and Maota was too\nweak to tear it loose. He could only weep out his rage.\n  \n \n  When he could talk again, Maota said, \"I am sorry, Mr. Earthgod. I've\ndisgraced myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be sorry.\" Michaelson helped him to his feet. \"We fight for some\nreasons, cry for others. A priceless book is a good reason for either.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not for that. For not winning. I should have killed you last night\nwhen I had the chance. The gods give us chances and if we don't take\nthem we lose forever.\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you before! We are on the same side. Negotiate. Have you never\nheard of negotiation?\"\n  \n \n  \"You are a god,\" Maota said. \"One does not negotiate with gods. One\neither loves them, or kills them.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's another thing. I am not a god. Can't you understand?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course you are.\" Maota looked up, very sure. \"Mortals cannot step\nfrom star to star like crossing a shallow brook.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. I don't step from one star to another. An invention does that.\nJust an invention. I carry it with me. It's a tiny thing. No one would\never guess it has such power. So you see, I'm human, just like you. Hit\nme and I hurt. Cut me and I bleed. I love. I hate. I was born. Some day\nI'll die. See? I'm human. Just a human with a machine. No more than\nthat.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n"

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Michael blushed. He should indeed. For a year prior to his leaving the\nLodge, he had carefully studied the customs and tabus of the Universe\nso that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself,\nwith confidence and ease. Under the system of universal kinship, all\nthe customs and all the tabus of all the planets were the law on all\nthe other planets. For the Wise Ones had decided many years before\nthat wars arose from not understanding one's fellows, not sympathizing\nwith them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the\nsame laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be no\ndifferences, and hence no wars.\n  \n \n  Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred years\nthere had been no war in the United Universe, and there was peace and\nplenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar\nsystems\u2014injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepaths\nof Aldebaran were still trying to add\n   \n   thought\n   \n  to the statute).\n  \n \n  Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any\nreason for the Lodge's existence, any reason for a group of humans to\nretire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive\nforefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had,\nperhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the\nworld. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's\nface upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the\npast\u2014the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coal\nfurnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days?\n  \n \n  The Father Superior had smiled. \"You are not yet a fully fledged\nBrother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved\nyour majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why\ndon't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?\"\n  \n \n  Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying\nthe ways of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because\nhe had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his\npreparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence.\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n"

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n"

LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full.",
        " \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>Five doctors were bustling back and forth as Walton entered the main\nsection of the clinic. There must have been a hundred babies there,\neach in a little pen of its own, and the doctors were humming from one\nto the next, while anxious parents watched from screens above.\n  \n \n  The Equalization Law provided that every child be presented at its\nlocal clinic within two weeks of birth, for an examination and a\ncertificate. Perhaps one in ten thousand would be denied a\ncertificate ... and life.\n  \n \n  \"Hello, Mr. Walton. What brings you down here?\"\n  \n \n  Walton smiled affably. \"Just a routine investigation, Doctor. I try to\nkeep in touch with every department we have, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. FitzMaugham was down here to look around a little while ago. We're\nreally getting a going-over today, Mr. Walton!\"\n  \n \n  \"Umm. Yes.\" Walton didn't like that, but there was nothing he could\ndo about it. He'd have to rely on the old man's abiding faith in his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 to pull him out of any possible stickiness that arose.\n  \n \n  \"Seen my brother around?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Fred? He's working in room seven, running analyses. Want me to get him\nfor you, Mr. Walton?\"\n  \n \n  \"No\u2014no, don't bother him, thanks. I'll find him later.\" Inwardly,\nWalton felt relieved. Fred Walton, his younger brother, was a doctor in\nthe employ of Popeek. Little love was lost between the brothers, and\nRoy did not care to have Fred know he was down there.\n  \n \n  Strolling casually through the clinic, he peered at a few plump,\nsqualling babies, and said, \"Find many sour ones today?\"\n  \n \n  \"Seven so far. They're scheduled for the 1100 chamber. Three tuberc,\ntwo blind, one congenital syph.\"\n  \n \n  \"That only makes six,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, and a spastic,\" the doctor said. \"Biggest haul we've had yet.\nSeven in one morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have any trouble with the parents?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you think?\" the doctor asked. \"But some of them seemed to\nunderstand. One of the tuberculars nearly raised the roof, though.\"\n  \n \n  Walton shuddered. \"You remember his name?\" he asked, with feigned calm.\n  \n \n  Silence for a moment. \"No. Darned if I can think of it. I can look it\nup for you if you like.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother,\" Walton said hurriedly.\n  \n \n  He moved on, down the winding corridor that led to the execution\nchamber. Falbrough, the executioner, was studying a list of names at\nhis desk when Walton appeared.\n  \n \n  Falbrough didn't look like the sort of man who would enjoy his work. He\nwas short and plump, with a high-domed bald head and glittering contact\nlenses in his weak blue eyes. \"Morning, Mr. Walton.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Doctor Falbrough. You'll be operating soon, won't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eleven hundred, as usual.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. There's a new regulation in effect from now on,\" Walton said.\n\"To keep public opinion on our side.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Henceforth, until further notice, you're to check each baby that\ncomes to you against the main file, just to make sure there's been no\nmistake. Got that?\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Mistake?\n   \n  But how\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that, Falbrough. There was quite a tragic slip-up at one\nof the European centers yesterday. We may all hang for it if news gets\nout.\"\n   \n   How glibly I reel this stuff off\n   \n  , Walton thought in amazement.\n  \n \n  Falbrough looked grave. \"I see, sir. Of course. We'll double-check\neverything from now on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. Begin with the 1100 batch.\"\n  \n \n  Walton couldn't bear to remain down in the clinic any longer. He left\nvia a side exit, and signaled for a lift tube.\n  \n \n  Minutes later he was back in his office, behind the security of a\ntowering stack of work. His pulse was racing; his throat was dry. He\nremembered what FitzMaugham had said:\n   \n   Once we make even one exception,\nthe whole framework crumbles.\n   \n \n \n  Well, the framework had begun crumbling, then. And there was little\ndoubt in Walton's mind that FitzMaugham knew or would soon know what he\nhad done. He would have to cover his traces, somehow.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed and said, \"Dr. Falbrough of Happysleep calling\nyou, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Put him on.\"\n  \n \n  The screen lit and Falbrough's face appeared; its normal blandness had\ngiven way to wild-eyed tenseness.\n  \n \n  \"What is it, Doctor?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a good thing you issued that order when you did, sir! You'll\nnever guess what just happened\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"No guessing games, Falbrough. Speak up.\"\n  \n \n  \"I\u2014well, sir, I ran checks on the seven babies they sent me this\nmorning. And guess\u2014I mean\u2014well, one of them shouldn't have been sent\nto me!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the truth, sir. A cute little baby indeed. I've got his card\nright here. The boy's name is Philip Prior, and his gene-pattern is\nfine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any recommendation for euthanasia on the card?\" Walton asked.\n  \n \n  \"No, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton chewed at a ragged cuticle for a moment, counterfeiting great\nanxiety. \"Falbrough, we're going to have to keep this very quiet.\nSomeone slipped up in the examining room, and if word gets out that\nthere's been as much as one mistake, we'll have a mob swarming over us\nin half an hour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\" Falbrough looked terribly grave. \"What should I do, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't say a word about this to\n   \n   anyone\n   \n  , not even the men in the\nexamining room. Fill out a certificate for the boy, find his parents,\napologize and return him to them. And make sure you keep checking for\nany future cases of this sort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly, sir. Is that all?\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" Walton said crisply, and broke the contact. He took a deep\nbreath and stared bleakly at the far wall.\n  \n \n  The Prior boy was safe. And in the eyes of the law\u2014the Equalization\nLaw\u2014Roy Walton was now a criminal. He was every bit as much a criminal\nas the man who tried to hide his dying father from the investigators,\nor the anxious parents who attempted to bribe an examining doctor.\n  \n \n  He felt curiously dirty. And, now that he had betrayed FitzMaugham and\nthe Cause, now that it was done, he had little idea why he had done\nit, why he had jeopardized the Popeek program, his position\u2014his life,\neven\u2014for the sake of one potentially tubercular baby.\n  \n \n  Well, the thing was done.\n  \n \n  No. Not quite. Later, when things had quieted down, he would have to\nfinish the job by transferring all the men in the clinic to distant\nplaces and by obliterating the computer's memories of this morning's\nactivities.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed again. \"Your brother is on the wire, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton trembled imperceptibly as he said, \"Put him on.\" Somehow, Fred\nnever called unless he could say or do something unpleasant. And\nWalton was very much afraid that his brother meant no good by this\ncall. No good at all.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Roy Walton watched his brother's head and shoulders take form out of\nthe swirl of colors on the screen. Fred Walton was more compact, built\ncloser to the ground than his rangy brother; he was a squat five-seven,\nnext to Roy's lean six-two. Fred had always threatened to \"get even\"\nwith his older brother as soon as they were the same size, but to\nFred's great dismay he had never managed to catch up with Roy in height.\n  \n \n  Even on the screen, Fred's neck and shoulders gave an impression of\ntremendous solidity and force. Walton waited for his brother's image to\ntake shape, and when the time lag was over he said, \"Well, Fred? What\ngoes?\"\n  \n \n  His brother's eyes flickered sleepily. \"They tell me you were down here\na little while ago, Roy. How come I didn't rate a visit?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wasn't in your section. It was official business, anyway. I didn't\nhave time.\"\n  \n \n  Walton fixed his eyes sharply on the caduceus emblem gleaming on Fred's\nlapel, and refused to look anywhere else.\n  \n \n  Fred said slowly, \"You had time to tinker with our computer, though.\"\n  \n \n  \"Official business!\"\n  \n \n  \"Really, Roy?\" His brother's tone was venomous. \"I happened to\nbe using the computer shortly after you this morning. I was\ncurious\u2014unpardonably so, dear brother. I requested a transcript of\nyour conversation with the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Sparks seemed to flow from the screen. Walton sat back, feeling numb.\nHe managed to pull his sagging mouth back into a stiff hard line and\nsay, \"That's a criminal offense, Fred. Any use I make of a Popeek\ncomputer outlet is confidential.\"\n  \n \n  \"Criminal offence? Maybe so ... but that makes two of us, then. Eh,\nRoy?\"\n  \n \n  \"How much do you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't want me to recite it over a public communications system,\nwould you? Your friend FitzMaugham might be listening to every word of\nthis, and I have too much fraternal feeling for that. Ole Doc Walton\ndoesn't want to get his bigwig big brother in trouble\u2014oh, no!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks for small blessings,\" Roy said acidly.\n  \n \n  \"You got me this job. You can take it away. Let's call it even for now,\nshall we?\"\n  \n \n  \"Anything you like,\" Walton said. He was drenched in sweat, though\nthe ingenious executive filter in the sending apparatus of the screen\ncloaked that fact and presented him as neat and fresh. \"I have some\nwork to do now.\" His voice was barely audible.\n  \n \n  \"I won't keep you any longer, then,\" Fred said.\n  \n \n  The screen went dead.\n  \n \n  Walton killed the contact at his end, got up, walked to the window. He\nnudged the opaquer control and the frosty white haze over the glass\ncleared away, revealing the fantastic beehive of the city outside.\n  \n \n \n   Idiot!\n   \n  he thought.\n   \n   Fool!\n   \n \n \n  He had risked everything to save one baby, one child probably doomed\nto an early death anyway. And FitzMaugham knew\u2014the old man could see\nthrough Walton with ease\u2014and Fred knew, too. His brother, and his\nfather-substitute.\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham might well choose to conceal Roy's defection this time,\nbut would surely place less trust in him in the future. And as for\nFred....\n  \n \n  There was no telling what Fred might do. They had never been\nparticularly close as brothers; they had lived with their parents (now\nalmost totally forgotten) until Roy was nine and Fred seven. Their\nparents had gone down off Maracaibo in a jet crash; Roy and Fred had\nbeen sent to the public cr\u00e8che.\n  \n \n  After that it had been separate paths for the brothers. For Roy, an\neducation in the law, a short spell as Senator FitzMaugham's private\nsecretary, followed last month by his sudden elevation to assistant\nadministrator of the newly-created Popeek Bureau. For Fred, medicine,\nunsuccessful private practice, finally a job in the Happysleep section\nof Popeek, thanks to Roy.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Joyce glared at him furiously. \"Four! Act your age! We've got to do\nsomething with him. It's preposterous that we should be detained here\nat the whim of a mere blob!\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't figure it's a whim,\" Grampa said. \"Circular gravity is what\nhe's got to have for one reason or another, so he just naturally bends\nthe space-time continuum around him\u2014conscious or subconscious, I don't\nknow. But protoplasm is always more efficient than machines, so the\nflivver won't move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care why that thing does it,\" Joyce said icily. \"I want it\nstopped, and the sooner the better. If it won't turn the gravity off,\nwe'll just have to do away with it.\"\n  \n \n  \"How?\" asked Four. \"Fweep's skin is pretty close to impervious and\nyou can't shoot him, stab him or poison him. He doesn't breathe, so\nyou can't drown or strangle him. You can't imprison him; he 'eats'\neverything. And violence might be more dangerous to us than to him.\nRight now, Fweep is friendly, but suppose he got mad! He could lower\nhis radioactive shield or he might increase the gravity by a few times.\nEither way, you'd feel rather uncomfortable, Grammy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't call me 'Grammy!' Well, what are we going to do, just sit around\nand wait for that thing to die?\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd have a long wait,\" Four observed. \"Fweep is the only one of his\nkind on this planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Probably he's immortal.\"\n  \n \n  \"And he doesn't reproduce?\" Reba asked sympathetically.\n  \n \n  \"Probably not. If he doesn't die, there's no point in reproduction.\nReproduction is nature's way of providing racial immortality to mortal\ncreatures.\"\n  \n \n  \"But he must have some way of reproduction,\" Reba argued. \"An egg or\nsomething. He couldn't just have sprung into being as he is now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe he developed,\" Four offered. \"It seems to me that he's bigger\nthan when we first landed.\" \"He must have been here a long, long time,\"\nFred said. \"Fweepland, as Four calls it, kept its atmosphere and its\nwater, which a planet this size ordinarily would have lost by now.\"\n  \n"

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n<doc-sep>The room was large, as rooms went nowadays\u2014thirty by twenty, with deck\nupon deck of Donnerson micro-memory-tubes racked along one wall and a\nbank of microfilm records along the other. In six weeks of life Popeek\nhad piled up an impressive collection of data.\n  \n \n  While he stood there, the computer chattered, lights flashed. New facts\npoured into the memory banks. It probably went on day and night.\n  \n \n  \"Can I help\u2014oh, it's you, Mr. Walton,\" a white-smocked technician\nsaid. Popeek employed a small army of technicians, each one faceless\nand without personality, but always ready to serve. \"Is there anything\nI can do?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm simply running a routine checkup. Mind if I use the machine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all, sir. Go right ahead.\"\n  \n \n  Walton grinned lightly and stepped forward. The technician practically\nbacked out of his presence.\n  \n \n \n   No doubt I must radiate charisma\n   \n  , he thought. Within the building he\nwore a sort of luminous halo, by virtue of being Director FitzMaugham's\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 and second-in-command. Outside, in the colder reality of the\ncrowded metropolis, he kept his identity and Popeek rank quietly to\nhimself.\n  \n \n  Frowning, he tried to remember the Prior boy's name. Ah ... Philip,\nwasn't it? He punched out a request for the card on Philip Prior.\n  \n \n  A moment's pause followed, while the millions of tiny cryotronic\ncircuits raced with information pulses, searching the Donnerson\ntubes for Philip Prior's record. Then, a brief squeaking sound and a\nyellow-brown card dropped out of the slot:\n  \n \n \n   3216847AB1\n   \n \n \n \n   PRIOR, Philip Hugh. Born 31 May 2232, New York General Hospital, New\nYork. First son of Prior, Lyle Martin and Prior, Ava Leonard. Wgt. at\nbirth 5lb. 3oz.\n   \n \n \n  An elaborate description of the boy in great detail followed, ending\nwith blood type, agglutinating characteristic, and gene-pattern,\ncodified. Walton skipped impatiently through that and came to the\nnotification typed in curt, impersonal green capital letters at the\nbottom of the card:\n  \n \n \n   EXAMINED AT N Y EUTH CLINIC 10 JUNE 2332\n   \n \n \n   EUTHANASIA RECOMMENDED\n   \n \n \n  He glanced at his watch: the time was 1026. The boy was probably still\nsomewhere in the clinic lab, waiting for the figurative axe to descend.\n  \n \n  Walton had set up the schedule himself: the gas chamber delivered\nHappysleep each day at 1100 and 1500. He had about half an hour to save\nPhilip Prior.\n  \n \n  He peered covertly over his shoulder; no one was in sight. He slipped\nthe baby's card into his breast pocket.\n  \n \n  That done, he typed out a requisition for explanation of the\ngene-sorting code the clinic used. Symbols began pouring forth,\nand Walton puzzledly correlated them with the line of gibberish on\nPhillip Prior's record card. Finally he found the one he wanted:\n   \n   3f2,\ntubercular-prone\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He scrapped the guide sheet he had and typed out a message to the\nmachine.\n   \n   Revision of card number 3216847AB1 follows. Please alter in\nall circuits.\n   \n \n \n  He proceeded to retype the child's card, omitting both the fatal symbol\n   \n   3f2\n   \n  and the notation recommending euthanasia from the new version.\nThe machine beeped an acknowledgement. Walton smiled. So far, so good.\n  \n \n  Then, he requested the boy's file all over again. After the customary\npause, a card numbered 3216847AB1 dropped out of the slot. He read it.\n  \n \n  The deletions had been made. As far as the machine was concerned,\nPhilip Prior was a normal, healthy baby.\n  \n \n  He glanced at his watch. 1037. Still twenty-three minutes before this\nmorning's haul of unfortunates was put away.\n  \n \n  Now came the real test: could he pry the baby away from the doctors\nwithout attracting too much attention to himself in the process?\n  \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n"

He didn't like it. Not a bit! It was too\u2014too\u2014\n  \n \n  He turned away angrily, ripped the offending article from about his\nneck, and chose another necktie from the rack. This one was brighter,\ngaudier, much more in keeping with the gaiety of his mood. He emitted a\ngrunt of satisfaction, spun from the mirror to face his two companions\ntriumphantly.\n  \n \n  \"There! How do you like\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always\nlanguid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem\nconcerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned\ninsultingly and forced a shudder.\n  \n \n  \"Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!\"\n  \n \n  \"You,\" Chip told him serenely, \"have no appreciation of beauty. What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think of it, Padre?\"\n  \n \n  \"Salvation\" Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black,\na lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his\nweathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. \"Well,\nmy boy,\" he admitted, \"there is\n   \n   some\n   \n  Biblical precedent for\nyour\u2014ahem!\u2014clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coat\nwhich was of many colors\u2014'\"\n  \n \n  \"Both of you,\" declared Chip, \"give me a pain in the pants!\nStick-in-the-muds! Here we are in port for the first time in months,\ncargo-bins loaded to the gunwales with enough ekalastron to make us\nrich for life\u2014and you sit here like a pair of stuffed owls!\n  \n \n  \"Well, not me! I'm going to take a night off, throw myself a party the\nlikes of which was never seen around these parts. Put a candle in the\nwindow, chilluns, 'cause li'l' Chip won't be home till the wee, sma'\nhours!\"\n  \n \n  Syd chuckled.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q., big shot. But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-joint\nentertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer!\"\n  \n \n  Salvation said soberly, \"Syd's just fooling, my boy. But I\n   \n   would\n   \n  be\ncareful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law\nand order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as\nwell as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent\nand unheeding the words of Him who rules all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that\nSalvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who\nespoused the principle of \"turning the other cheek\" to evildoers.\nSalvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n  \n \n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation\nacknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be\nthe best hand with a gun!\n  \n \n  Now Chip gave quiet answer. \"I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well,\nSyd\u2014sure you won't change your mind and come along?\"\n  \n \n  \"No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this\njalopy with ek. Got to stay and watch 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. I'm off alone, then. See you later!\"\n  \n \n  And, whistling, Chip Warren stepped through the lock of the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  onto the soil of the asteroid Danae.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was only two stories down the moving ramp to Lorelei Cooper's\nlaboratory. Peter took it in fifteen seconds, running, and stumbled to\na halt in front of the door marked \"Radiation.\" She had set her door\nmechanism to \"Etaoin Shrdlu,\" principally because he hated double-talk.\nHe mouthed the syllables, had to repeat them because he put an accent\nin the wrong place, and squeezed through the door as soon as it opened\nfar enough to admit him.\n  \n \n  Lorelei, beautiful in spite of dark-circled eyes and a smear of grease\non her chin, looked up from a huge ledger at the end of the room. One\nblonde eyebrow arched in the quizzical expression he knew so well.\n  \n \n  \"What makes, Peter my love?\" she asked, and bent back to the ledger.\nThen she did a double-take, looked at his face intently, and said,\n\"Darling, what's wrong?\"\n  \n \n  He said, \"Have you seen the news recently?\"\n  \n \n  She frowned. \"Why, no\u2014Harry and I have been working for thirty-six\nhours straight. Haven't seen anybody, haven't heard anything. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't believe me. Where's your newsbox?\"\n  \n \n  She came around the desk and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Pete,\nyou know I haven't one\u2014it bores me or upsets me, depending on whether\nthere's trouble or not. What\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry, I forgot,\" he said. \"But you have a scanner?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, of course. But really, Pete\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll understand in a minute. Turn it on, Lorelei.\"\n  \n \n  She gazed at him levelly for a moment, kissed him impulsively, and then\nwalked over to the video panel on the wall and swept a mountain of\npapers away from in front of it. She turned the selector dial to \"News\"\nand pressed the stud.\n  \n \n  A faint wash of color appeared on the panel, strengthened slowly, and\nsuddenly leapt into full brilliance.\n  \n \n  Lorelei caught her breath.\n  \n \n  It was a street scene in the Science City of Manhattan, flooded by\nthe warm spring sunshine. Down on the lowest level, visible past the\ntransport and passenger tubes, the parks and moving ways should have\nbeen dotted with colorful, holiday crowds. The people were there,\nyes but they were flowing away in a swiftly-widening circle. They\ndisappeared into buildings, and the ways snatched them up, and in a\nheartbeat they were gone.\n  \n \n  There were left only two blood-red, malignant monstrosities somehow\ndefiling the air they floated in; and below them, a pitiful huddle of\nflesh no longer recognizable as human beings. They were not dead, those\nmen and women, but they wanted to be. Their bodies had been impossibly\njoined, fused together into a single obscene, floundering mass of\nhelpless protoplasm. The thin moaning that went up from them was more\nhorrible than any cry of agony.\n  \n \n  \"The Invaders are here, citizens,\" the commentator was saying in a\nstrangled voice. \"Stay off the streets. Hide yourselves. Stay off the\nstreets....\" His voice droned on, but neither of them heard it.\n  \n<doc-sep>Chip stared at his friend bewilderedly for a moment. Then he grinned.\n\"Hey\u2014I must be getting slightly whacky in my old age. I stand here\nwith an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I\nthought you said 'Lorelei.' The Lorelei, my space-cop friend, is a\nmyth. An old Teutonic myth about a beautiful damsel who sits out in\nthe middle of a sea on a treacherous rock, combing her golden locks,\nwarbling and luring her fascinated admirers to destruction.\"\n  \n \n  He grunted. \"A dirty trick, if you ask me. Catch a snort of this\nalleged Scotch, pal, and I'll torture your eardrums with the whole, sad\nstory.\" He started to sing. \"'\n   \n   Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten\n   \n  \u2014'\"\n  \n \n  The Patrolman laid a hand on his arm, silenced him.\n  \n \n  \"It's not funny, Chip. You've described the Lorelei exactly. That's\nhow she got her name. An incredibly beautiful woman who wantonly lures\nspace-mariners to their death.\n  \n \n  \"The only difference is that her 'rock' is an asteroid somewhere in\nthe Belt\u2014and she does not sing, she calls! She began exercising\nher vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth reckoning. Since\nthen, no less than a dozen spacecraft\u2014freighters, liners, even one\nPatrolship\u2014have fallen prey to her wiles. Their crews have been\nbrutally murdered, their cargos stolen.\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute!\" interrupted Chip shrewdly. \"How do you know about her\nif the crews have been murdered?\"\n  \n \n  \"She has a habit of locking the controls,\" explained Haldane, \"and\nsetting ravaged ships adrift. Apparently there is no room on her\nhideout\u2014wherever it is\u2014for empty hulks. One of these ships was\nsalvaged by a courageous cabin-boy who hid from the Lorelei and her\npirate band beneath a closetful of soiled linens in the laundry. He\ndescribed her. His description goes perfectly with less accurate\nglimpses seen over the visiphones of several score spacecraft!\"\n  \n \n  Chip said soberly, \"So it's no joke, eh, pal? Sorry I popped off. I\nthought you were pulling my leg. Where do\n   \n   I\n   \n  come into this mess,\nthough?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ekalastron!\" grunted Johnny succinctly. \"A jackpot prize for any\ncorsair! And you\n   \n   advertised\n   \n  a cargo of it over the etherwaves! The\nLorelei will be waiting for you with her tongue hanging out. The only\nthing for you to do, kid, is go back to Jupiter or Io as fast as you\ncan get there. Make the Patrol give you a convoy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  A sudden light danced in Chip Warren's eyes. It was a light Syd Palmer\nwould have groaned to see\u2014for it usually presaged trouble. It was a\nbright, hard, reckless light.\n  \n \n  \"Hold your jets, Johnny!\" drawled Chip. \"Aren't you forgetting one\nthing?

She can't touch the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  , because\nit's being plated right now!\"\n  \n \n  Haldane snapped his fingers in quick remembrance.\n  \n \n  \"By thunder, you're right!

But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-joint\nentertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer!\"\n  \n \n  Salvation said soberly, \"Syd's just fooling, my boy. But I\n   \n   would\n   \n  be\ncareful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law\nand order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as\nwell as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent\nand unheeding the words of Him who rules all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that\nSalvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who\nespoused the principle of \"turning the other cheek\" to evildoers.\nSalvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n  \n \n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation\nacknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be\nthe best hand with a gun!\n  \n \n  Now Chip gave quiet answer. \"I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well,\nSyd\u2014sure you won't change your mind and come along?\"\n  \n \n  \"No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this\njalopy with ek. Got to stay and watch 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. I'm off alone, then. See you later!\"\n  \n \n  And, whistling, Chip Warren stepped through the lock of the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  onto the soil of the asteroid Danae.\n  \n<doc-sep>Haldane shouted and moved at the same time. His arm lashed out wildly,\nthrusting, smashing Chip to the floor in a sprawling heap. The as-yet\nunopened bottle was now violently opened; it splintered into a thousand\nshards against a wall.\n  \n \n  Bruised and shaken, Chip lifted his head to see what had caused\nJohnny's alarm. Even as he did so, the dull gloom of the bar was\nblazoned with searing effulgence. A lancet of flame leaped from the\ndark, rearward doorway, burst in Johnny Haldane's face!\n  \n \n  The Patrolman cried once, a choking cry that died in a mewling whimper.\nHis unused pistol slipped from slackening fingers, and he sagged to\nthe floor. Again crimson lightning laced the shadows; Haldane's body\njerked, and the air was raw with the hot, sickening stench of charred\nflesh.\n  \n \n  With an instinct born of bitter years, Chip had come to his knees\nbehind the shelter of the mahogany bar. But now his own flame-pistol\nwas in his hand, and a dreadful rage was mingled with the agony in his\nheart. Reckless of results, he sprang to his feet, gun spewing livid\ndeath into the shadows.\n  \n \n  His blast found a mark. For an instant flame haloed a human face drawn\nin inhuman pain. A heavy, sultry, bestial face, already puckered with\none long, ugly scar that ran from right temple to jawbone, now newly\nscarred with the red brand of Chip's marksmanship.\n  \n \n  Then, before Chip could fire again, came the rasp of pounding\nfootsteps. The man turned and fled. Chip bent over his fallen friend,\nseeking, with hands that did not even feel the heat, fluttering life\nbeneath still smoldering cloth.\n  \n \n  He felt\u2014nothing. Johnny was dead.\n  \n \n  A snarl of sheer animal rage burst from Chip's lips. Someone would pay\nfor this; pay dearly! Help was coming now. He himself would lead the\nhue-and-cry that would track a foul murderer to his lair. He spun as\nthe footsteps drew nearer.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry!\" he cried. \"This way! Follow me\u2014\"\n  \n \n  In a bound, he hurdled the bar, lingered at the door only long enough\nto let the others mark his course. For they had burst into the room,\nnow, a full score of them. Excited, hard-bitten dogs of space,\nquick-triggered and willing. Once more he cried for help.\n  \n \n  \"After him! Come on! He\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And then\u2014disaster struck! For a reedy voice broke from the van of the\nmob. The voice of the Martian bartender.\n  \n \n  \"That's him!\" he piped sibilantly. \"That's the man! He's a desperate\ncriminal, wanted on four planets for murder! The Patrolman came to\narrest him\u2014\n   \n   and now he's murdered the Spacie\n   \n  !\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Two hours later, Chip was still following the bright pinpoint of\nscarlet which marked the course of his quarry.\n  \n \n  In the time that had elapsed since their take-off, he had told his\nfriends the whole story. When he told about the Lorelei, Salvation\nSmith's seamy old features screwed up in a perplexed grimace. \"A\nwoman pirate in the Belt, son? I find it hard to believe. Yet\u2014\" And\nwhen he described the death of Johnny Haldane, anger smoldered in the\nmissionary's eyes, and Syd Palmer's hands knotted into tight, white\nfists. Said Syd, \"A man with a scar, eh? Well, we'll catch him sooner\nor later. And when we do\u2014\" His tone boded no good to the man who had\nslain an old and loved friend.\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact,\" offered Salvation, \"we've got him now. Any time\nyou say the word, Chip. We're faster than he is. We can close in on him\nin five minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" nodded Warren grimly. \"But we won't do it\u2014yet. I'm borrowing\na bit of Johnny's strategy. I've been plotting his course. As soon as\nI'm sure of his destination, we'll take care of\n   \n   him\n   \n  . But our first\nand most vital problem is to locate the Lorelei's hideaway.\"\n  \n \n  Syd said, \"That's all right with me, chum. I like a good scrap as much\nas the next guy. Better, maybe. But this isn't our concern, strictly\nspeaking. What we ought to do is report this matter to the Space\nPatrol, let them take care of it.\"\n  \n \n  Salvation shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"That's where you're mistaken, Sydney.

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n  \n<doc-sep>III\n  \n \n  From a billion miles away, from a bourne unguessable thousands of\nlight-years distant, came the faint, far whisper of a voice. Nearer and\nnearer it came, and ever faster, till it throbbed upon Chip's eardrums\nwith booming savagery.\n  \n \n  \"\u2014coming to, now. Good! We'll soon find out\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Chip opened his eyes, too dazed, at first, to understand the situation\nin which he found himself. Gone was the familiar control-turret of the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  , gone the bulger into which he had so hastily clambered. He\nlay on the parched, rocky soil of a\u2014a something. A planetoid, perhaps.\nAnd he was surrounded by a motley crew of strangers: scum of all the\nplanets that circle the Sun....\n  \n \n  Then recollection flooded back upon him, sudden and complete. The\nchase ... the call of the fateful Lorelei ... the crash! New strength,\nborn of anger, surged through him. He lifted his head.\n  \n \n  \"My\u2014my companions?\" he demanded weakly.\n  \n \n  The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massive\nof shoulder and thigh, black-haired, with an unshaven blue jaw,\nraven-bright eyes and a jutting, aquiline nose like the beak of a hawk,\nloosed a satisfied grunt.\n  \n \n  \"Ah! Back to normal, eh, sailor? Damn near time!\"\n  \n \n  Climbing to his feet sent a swift wave of giddiness through Chip\u2014but\nhe managed it. He fought down the vertigo which threatened to overwhelm\nhim, and confronted the big man boldly.\n  \n \n  \"What,\" he stormed, \"is the meaning of this?\"\n  \n \n  The giant stared at him for a moment, his jaw slack. Then his\nraven-bright eyes glittered; he slapped a trunklike thigh and guffawed\nin boisterous mirth.\n  \n \n  \"Hear that?\" he roared to his companions. \"Quite a guy, ain't he?\n'What's the meanin' o' this?' he asks! Game little fightin' cock, hey?\"\nThen he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement in\nhis eyes. Here was not a man to be trifled with, Chip realized. His\ntone assumed a biting edge. \"The meanin' is, my bucko,\" he answered\nmirthlessly, \"that you've run afoul o' your last reef. Unless you have\na sane head on your shoulders, and you're willing to talk fast and\nstraight!\"\n  \n \n  \"Talk?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't stall. We've already unloaded your bins. We found it. And a nice\nhaul, too. Thanks for lettin' us know it was on the way.\" The burly one\nchuckled coarsely. \"We'd have took it, anyway, but you helped matters\nout by comin' to us.\"\n  \n \n  Johnny Haldane had been right, then. Chip remembered his friend's\nominous warning. \"\u2014if your message was intercepted, you may have\nplayed into the hands of\u2014\" He said slowly, \"Then you\n   \n   are\n   \n  the\nLorelei's men?\"\n  \n \n  \"The who? Never mind that, bucko, just talk. That ekalastron\u2014where did\nit come from?\"\n  \n \n  And it occurred to Warren suddenly that although the big man\n   \n   did\n   \n  hold\nthe whip hand, he was still not in possession of the most important\nsecret of all! While the location of the ekalastron mine remained a\nsecret, a deadlock existed.\n  \n \n  \"And if I won't tell\u2014?\" he countered shrewdly.\n  \n \n  \"Why, then, sailor\u2014\" The pirate leader's hamlike fists tightened, and\na cold light glinted in his eyes\u2014\"why, then I guess maybe I'll have to\nbeat it out o' you!\"\n  \n"

BOND\n  \n \n  Far out in limitless Space she plied\n   \n  her deadly trade ... a Lorelei of the\n   \n  void, beckoning spacemen to death and\n   \n  destruction with her beautiful siren lure.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1941.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Chip Warren stood before an oblong of glass set into one wall of\nthe spaceship\n   \n   Chickadee II\n   \n  , stared at what he saw reflected\ntherefrom\u2014and frowned. He didn't like it. Not a bit! It was too\u2014too\u2014\n  \n \n  He turned away angrily, ripped the offending article from about his\nneck, and chose another necktie from the rack. This one was brighter,\ngaudier, much more in keeping with the gaiety of his mood. He emitted a\ngrunt of satisfaction, spun from the mirror to face his two companions\ntriumphantly.\n  \n \n  \"There! How do you like\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always\nlanguid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem\nconcerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned\ninsultingly and forced a shudder.\n  \n \n  \"Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!\"\n  \n \n  \"You,\" Chip told him serenely, \"have no appreciation of beauty. What do\n   \n   you\n   \n  think of it, Padre?\"\n  \n \n  \"Salvation\" Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black,\na lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his\nweathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. \"Well,\nmy boy,\" he admitted, \"there is\n   \n   some\n   \n  Biblical precedent for\nyour\u2014ahem!\u2014clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coat\nwhich was of many colors\u2014'\"\n  \n \n  \"Both of you,\" declared Chip, \"give me a pain in the pants!\nStick-in-the-muds! Here we are in port for the first time in months,\ncargo-bins loaded to the gunwales with enough ekalastron to make us\nrich for life\u2014and you sit here like a pair of stuffed owls!\n  \n \n  \"Well, not me! I'm going to take a night off, throw myself a party the\nlikes of which was never seen around these parts. Put a candle in the\nwindow, chilluns, 'cause li'l' Chip won't be home till the wee, sma'\nhours!\"\n  \n \n  Syd chuckled.\n  \n \n  \"O.Q., big shot. But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-joint\nentertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer!\"\n  \n \n  Salvation said soberly, \"Syd's just fooling, my boy. But I\n   \n   would\n   \n  be\ncareful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law\nand order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as\nwell as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent\nand unheeding the words of Him who rules all\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that\nSalvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who\nespoused the principle of \"turning the other cheek\" to evildoers.\nSalvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly\nreligious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon\nhimself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God\nhe worshipped.\n  \n \n  That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of\nanger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation\nsometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation\nacknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be\nthe best hand with a gun!\n  \n \n  Now Chip gave quiet answer. \"I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well,\nSyd\u2014sure you won't change your mind and come along?\"\n  \n \n  \"No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this\njalopy with ek. Got to stay and watch 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"O.Q. I'm off alone, then. See you later!\"\n  \n \n  And, whistling, Chip Warren stepped through the lock of the\n   \n   Chickadee\n   \n  onto the soil of the asteroid Danae.\n  \n<doc-sep>Two hours later, Chip was still following the bright pinpoint of\nscarlet which marked the course of his quarry.\n  \n \n  In the time that had elapsed since their take-off, he had told his\nfriends the whole story. When he told about the Lorelei, Salvation\nSmith's seamy old features screwed up in a perplexed grimace. \"A\nwoman pirate in the Belt, son? I find it hard to believe. Yet\u2014\" And\nwhen he described the death of Johnny Haldane, anger smoldered in the\nmissionary's eyes, and Syd Palmer's hands knotted into tight, white\nfists. Said Syd, \"A man with a scar, eh? Well, we'll catch him sooner\nor later. And when we do\u2014\" His tone boded no good to the man who had\nslain an old and loved friend.\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact,\" offered Salvation, \"we've got him now. Any time\nyou say the word, Chip. We're faster than he is. We can close in on him\nin five minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" nodded Warren grimly. \"But we won't do it\u2014yet. I'm borrowing\na bit of Johnny's strategy. I've been plotting his course. As soon as\nI'm sure of his destination, we'll take care of\n   \n   him\n   \n  . But our first\nand most vital problem is to locate the Lorelei's hideaway.\"\n  \n \n  Syd said, \"That's all right with me, chum. I like a good scrap as much\nas the next guy. Better, maybe. But this isn't our concern, strictly\nspeaking. What we ought to do is report this matter to the Space\nPatrol, let them take care of it.\"\n  \n \n  Salvation shook his head.\n  \n \n  \"That's where you're mistaken, Sydney. This is very much our concern.\nSo much so, in fact, that we dare not make port again until it's\ncleared up. I think you have forgotten that it is not the scar-faced\nman who is wanted for the killing of Haldane\u2014but Chip!\"\n  \n \n  \"B-but\u2014\" gasped Palmer\u2014\"b-but that's ridiculous! Chip and Johnny were\nold buddies. Lifelong friends!\"\n  \n \n  \"Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence indicates Chip's guilt.\nTwenty men saw him standing over Johnny's dead body, with a\nflame-pistol in his hand. And the barkeep heard Johnny 'arrest' Chip\nand accuse him of murder!\"\n  \n \n  Chip said ruefully, \"That's right, Syd. It was only a joke, but it\nbackfired. The bartender thought Johnny meant it. He scooted out of\nthere like a bat out of Hades. I'm in it up to my neck unless we can\nbring back evidence that Scarface actually did the killing. And that\nmay not be so easy.\"\n  \n \n  He stirred restlessly. \"But we'll cross that bridge when we come to\nit. Right now our job is to keep this rat in sight. We've gone farther\nalready than I expected we would.\" He turned to the old preacher.\n\"Where do you think we're going, Padre? Out of the Belt entirely?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've been wondering that myself, son. I don't know for sure, of\ncourse, but it looks to me as if we're going for the Bog. If so, you'd\nbetter keep a weather-eye peeled.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bog!\" Chip had never penetrated the planetoids so deeply before,\nbut he knew of the Bog by hearsay. All men did. A treacherous region of\ntightly packed asteroids, a mad and whirling scramble of the gigantic\nrocks which, aeons ago, had been a planet. Few spacemen dared penetrate\nthe Bog. Of those who did dare, few returned to tell the tale. \"The\nBog! Say! I'd\n   \n   better\n   \n  keep a sharp lookout!\"\n  \n \n  He turned to the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  once more, fastened an eye to its lens. And\nthen\u2014\n  \n \n  \"Syd!\" he cried. \"Salvation! Look! She\u2014she\u2014!\"\n  \n \n  He pressed the plunger that transferred the\n   \n   perilens\n   \n  image to the\ncentral viewscreen. And as he did so, a phantom filled the area which\nshould have revealed yawning space, gay with the spangles of a myriad\nglowing orbs. The vision of an unbelievably beautiful girl, the\ngolden-crowned embodiment of a man's fondest dreaming, eyes wide with\nan indistinguishable emotion, arms stretched wide in mute appeal.\n  \n \n  And from the throats of all came simultaneous recognition.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   The Lorelei!\n   \n  \"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n \n   MASTER\n    \n   of Life and Death\n   \n \n \n  by\n   \n  ROBERT SILVERBERG\n  \n \n  ACE BOOKS\n   \n  A Division of A.

Roy Walton had the power to enforce those\nmeasures. But though his job was in the service of humanity, he soon\nfound himself the most hated man in the world.\n  \n \n  For it was\n   \n   his\n   \n  job to tell parents their children were unfit to live;\n   \n   he\n   \n  had to uproot people from their homes and send them to remote\nareas of the world. Now, threatened by mobs of outraged citizens,\ndenounced and blackened by the press, Roy Walton had to make a\ndecision: resign his post, or use his power to destroy his enemies,\nbecome a dictator in the hopes of saving humanity from its own folly.\nIn other words, should he become the MASTER OF LIFE AND DEATH?\n  \n \n \n  CAST OF CHARACTERS\n  \n \n  ROY WALTON\n  \n \n  He had to adopt the motto\u2014\n   \n   the ends justify the means\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  FITZMAUGHAM\n  \n \n  His reward for devoted service was\u2014an assassin's bullet.\n  \n \n  FRED WALTON\n  \n \n  His ambition was to fill his brother's shoes\u2014but he underestimated\ntheir size.\n  \n \n  LEE PERCY\n  \n \n  His specialty was sugarcoating bitter pills.\n  \n \n  PRIOR\n  \n \n  With the pen as his only weapon, could he save his son?\n  \n \n  DR. LAMARRE\n  \n \n  He died for discovering the secret of immortality.\n  \n \n \n  Contents\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The offices of the Bureau of Population Equalization, vulgarly known\nas Popeek, were located on the twentieth through twenty-ninth floors\nof the Cullen Building, a hundred-story monstrosity typical of\ntwenty-second-century neo-Victorian at its overdecorated worst. Roy\nWalton, Popeek's assistant administrator, had to apologize to himself\neach morning as he entered the hideous place.\n  \n \n  Since taking the job, he had managed to redecorate his own office\u2014on\nthe twenty-eighth floor, immediately below Director FitzMaugham's\u2014but\nthat had created only one minor oasis in the esthetically repugnant\nbuilding. It couldn't be helped, though; Popeek was unpopular, though\nnecessary; and, like the public hangman of some centuries earlier, the\nBureau did not rate attractive quarters.\n  \n \n  So Walton had removed some of the iridescent chrome scalloping that\ntrimmed the walls, replaced the sash windows with opaquers, and changed\nthe massive ceiling fixture to more subtle electroluminescents. But the\nmark of the last century was stamped irrevocably on both building and\noffice.\n  \n \n  Which was as it should be, Walton had finally realized. It was the last\ncentury's foolishness that had made Popeek necessary, after all.\n  \n \n  His desk was piled high with reports, and more kept arriving via\npneumochute every minute. The job of assistant administrator was\na thankless one, he thought; as much responsibility as Director\nFitzMaugham, and half the pay.\n  \n \n  He lifted a report from one eyebrow-high stack, smoothed the crinkly\npaper carefully, and read it.\n  \n \n  It was a despatch from Horrocks, the Popeek agent currently on duty in\nPatagonia. It was dated\n   \n   4 June 2232\n   \n  , six days before, and after a\nlong and rambling prologue in the usual Horrocks manner it went on to\nsay,\n   \n   Population density remains low here: 17.3 per square mile, far\nbelow optimum. Looks like a prime candidate for equalization.\n   \n \n \n  Walton agreed. He reached for his voicewrite and said sharply, \"Memo\nfrom Assistant Administrator Walton, re equalization of ...\" He paused,\npicking a trouble-spot at random, \"... central Belgium. Will the\nsection chief in charge of this area please consider the advisability\nof transferring population excess to fertile areas in Patagonia?\nRecommendation: establishment of industries in latter region, to ease\ntransition.\"\n  \n \n  He shut his eyes, dug his thumbs into them until bright flares of light\nshot across his eyeballs, and refused to let himself be bothered by\nthe multiple problems involved in dumping several hundred thousand\nBelgians into Patagonia. He forced himself to cling to one of Director\nFitzMaugham's oft-repeated maxims,\n   \n   If you want to stay sane, think of\nthese people as pawns in a chess game\u2014not as human beings.\n   \n \n \n  Walton sighed. This was the biggest chess problem in the history of\nhumanity, and the way it looked now, all the solutions led to checkmate\nin a century or less. They could keep equalizing population only so\nlong, shifting like loggers riding logs in a rushing river, before\ntrouble came.\n  \n \n  There was another matter to be attended to now. He picked up the\nvoicewrite again. \"Memo from the assistant administrator, re\nestablishment of new policy on reports from local agents: hire a staff\nof three clever girls to make a pr\u00e9cis of each report, eliminating\nirrelevant data.\"\n  \n \n  It was a basic step, one that should have been taken long ago. Now,\nwith three feet of reports stacked on his desk, it was mandatory. One\nof the troubles with Popeek was its newness; it had been established so\nsuddenly that most of its procedures were still in the formative stage.",
        "\n  \n \n  He took another report from the heap. This one was the data sheet of\nthe Zurich Euthanasia Center, and he gave it a cursory scanning. During\nthe past week, eleven substandard children and twenty-three substandard\nadults had been sent on to Happysleep.\n  \n \n  That was the grimmest form of population equalization. Walton initialed\nthe report, earmarked it for files, and dumped it in the pneumochute.\n  \n \n  The annunciator chimed.\n  \n \n  \"I'm busy,\" Walton said immediately.\n  \n \n  \"There's a Mr. Prior to see you,\" the annunciator's calm voice said.\n\"He insists it's an emergency.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see anyone for at least three hours.\" Walton\nstared gloomily at the growing pile of paper on his desk. \"Tell him he\ncan have ten minutes with me at\u2014oh, say, 1300.\"\n  \n \n  Walton heard an angry male voice muttering something in the outer\noffice, and then the annunciator said, \"He insists he must see you\nimmediately in reference to a Happysleep commitment.\"\n  \n \n  \"Commitments are irrevocable,\" Walton said heavily. The last thing in\nthe world he wanted was to see a man whose child or parent had just\nbeen committed. \"Tell Mr. Prior I can't see him at all.\"\n  \n \n  Walton found his fingers trembling; he clamped them tight to the edge\nof his desk to steady himself. It was all right sitting up here in this\nugly building and initialing commitment papers, but actually to\n   \n   see\n   \n  one of those people and try to convince him of the need\u2014\n  \n \n  The door burst open.\n  \n \n  A tall, dark-haired man in an open jacket came rushing through and\npaused dramatically just over the threshold. Immediately behind him\ncame three unsmiling men in the gray silk-sheen uniforms of security.\nThey carried drawn needlers.\n  \n \n  \"Are you Administrator Walton?\" the big man asked, in an astonishingly\ndeep, rich voice. \"I have to see you. I'm Lyle Prior.\"\n  \n \n  The three security men caught up and swarmed all over Prior. One of\nthem turned apologetically to Walton. \"We're terribly sorry about this,\nsir. He just broke away and ran. We can't understand how he got in\nhere, but he did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah\u2014yes. So I noticed,\" Walton remarked drily. \"See if he's planning\nto assassinate anybody, will you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Administrator Walton!\" Prior protested. \"I'm a man of peace! How can\nyou accuse me of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  One of the security men hit him. Walton stiffened and resisted the urge\nto reprimand the man. He was only doing his job, after all.\n  \n \n  \"Search him,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  They gave Prior an efficient going-over. \"He's clean, Mr. Walton.\nShould we take him to security, or downstairs to health?\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither. Leave him here with me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you sure you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Get out of here,\" Walton snapped. As the three security men slinked\naway, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for\nprotecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here\nand get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's\nsimply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world\nwho'd take this job. Now\n   \n   get out\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed\nand jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly\nunjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations\nprescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit\nthat to the guards.\n  \n \n  \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said,\nwithout a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a\nterribly busy man.\"\n  \n \n  \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's\ndesk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the\npsychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have\nhad you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little\ndiversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a\nman. \"I hadn't expected to find\u2014I mean that you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping\nfor?\"\n  \n \n  Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted.\n  \n \n  Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do\n   \n   something\n   \n  when I go home at\nnight. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No\nmore than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite\nremarkable.\"\n  \n \n  \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently.\n  \n \n  \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles.\nTen years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize.\nNow it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr.\nPrior\u2014and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is.\nTake Yeats, for instance\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior\nback to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand,\nanything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Walton....\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\"\n  \n \n  \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\"\n  \n \n  Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt\ncold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy.\n  \n \n  \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning\u2014potentially tubercular.\nThe boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Walton rose. \"\n   \n   No\n   \n  ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't\nask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're\nan intelligent man; you understand our program.\"\n  \n \n  \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the\nEuthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for\n   \n   other\n   \n  people. So did\neveryone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly\nhe said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a\nbaby every chance to live.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced\neuthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\"\n  \n \n  It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it.\n\"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe\nit out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic\ntraits.\"\n  \n \n  \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked.\n  \n \n  \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr.\nPrior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do\nthe impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\"\n  \n \n  Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly\nat Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton\nfeared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his\nupper left desk drawer.\n  \n \n  But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly.\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and\nslipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the\nchute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three\nbasilisks.\n  \n \n  In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been\nticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes\nhad been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been\nsterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves\nahead of time.\n  \n \n  It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn\ngenerations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal\nprogeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain,\nconsuming precious food?\n  \n \n  Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his\nteam succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light\noutfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about\nEarth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was\nstill growing.\n  \n \n  Prior's words haunted him.\n   \n   I was tubercular ... where would my poems\nbe now?\n   \n \n \n  The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been\ntubercular too.\n  \n \n \n   What good are poets?\n   \n  he asked himself savagely.\n  \n \n  The reply came swiftly:\n   \n   What good is anything, then?\n   \n  Keats,\nShakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How\nmuch duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing\nhis bookshelf\u2014his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a\none-room home.\n  \n \n  Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision.\n  \n \n  The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he\nadmitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it\nwould be a criminal act.\n  \n \n  But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one.\n  \n \n  Prior's baby.\n  \n \n  With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there\nare any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for\nthe next half-hour.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer\noffice was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening\nletters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into\nthe hallway.\n  \n \n  There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the\nlift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek\nwas organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the\nsecond-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a\nsingle child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking\nas effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought\nabout repeal of the entire Equalization Law.\n  \n \n  Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child,\nand after that I'll keep within the law.\n  \n \n  He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The\nclinic was on the twentieth floor.\n  \n \n  \"Roy.\"\n  \n \n  At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise.\nHe steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\"\n  \n \n  The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly,\nhis mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy.\nSomething the matter?\"\n  \n \n  Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been\na lot of work lately.\"\n  \n \n  As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek\nworked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham\nhad striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at\nthe age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving\nmankind from itself.\n  \n \n  The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength,\nRoy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad\nyou're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning,\nthough. Mind if I join you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\u2014not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried,\ndrawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a\nlittle, I think.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\"\n  \n \n  FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid\nyou'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director\nto enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed\n   \n   Fourteen\n   \n  ; there was\na coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed\n   \n   twenty\n   \n  , covering\nthe panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his\ndestination.\n  \n \n  As the tube began to descend, FitzMaugham said, \"Did Mr. Prior come to\nsee you this morning?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Walton said.\n  \n \n  \"He's the poet, isn't he? The one you say is so good?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right, sir,\" Walton said tightly.\n  \n \n  \"He came to see me first, but I had him referred down to you. What was\non his mind?\"\n  \n \n  Walton hesitated. \"He\u2014he wanted his son spared from Happysleep.\nNaturally, I had to turn him down.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" FitzMaugham agreed solemnly. \"Once we make even one\nexception, the whole framework crumbles.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The lift tube halted and rocked on its suspension. The door slid back,\nrevealing a neat, gleaming sign:\n  \n \n \n   FLOOR 20\n   \n \n \n   Euthanasia Clinic and Files\n   \n \n \n  Walton had forgotten the accursed sign. He began to wish he had avoided\ntraveling down with the director. He felt that his purpose must seem\nnakedly obvious now.\n  \n \n  The old man's eyes were twinkling amusedly. \"I guess you get off here,\"\nhe said. \"I hope you catch up with your work soon, Roy. You really\nshould take some time off for relaxation each day.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll try, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Walton stepped out of the tube and returned FitzMaugham's smile as the\ndoor closed again. Bitter thoughts assailed him as soon as he was alone.\n  \n \n \n   Some fine criminal you are. You've given the show away already! And\ndamn that smooth paternal smile. FitzMaugham knows! He must know!\n   \n \n \n  Walton wavered, then abruptly made his decision. He sucked in a deep\nbreath and walked briskly toward the big room where the euthanasia\nfiles were kept.\n  \n"

        " \n  CONTAGION\n  \n \n  By KATHERINE MacLEAN\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction October 1950.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n  Minos was such a lovely planet. Not a\n   \n  thing seemed wrong with it. Excepting the food,\n   \n  perhaps. And a disease that wasn't really.\n  \n \n \n  It was like an Earth forest in the fall, but it was not fall. The\nforest leaves were green and copper and purple and fiery red, and a\nwind sent patches of bright greenish sunlight dancing among the leaf\nshadows.\n  \n \n  The hunt party of the\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  filed along the narrow trail, guns\nready, walking carefully, listening to the distant, half familiar cries\nof strange birds.\n  \n \n  A faint crackle of static in their earphones indicated that a gun had\nbeen fired.\n  \n \n  \"Got anything?\" asked June Walton. The helmet intercom carried her\nvoice to the ears of the others without breaking the stillness of the\nforest.\n  \n \n  \"Took a shot at something,\" explained George Barton's cheerful voice\nin her earphones. She rounded a bend of the trail and came upon Barton\nstanding peering up into the trees, his gun still raised. \"It looked\nlike a duck.\"\n  \n \n  \"This isn't Central Park,\" said Hal Barton, his brother, coming into\nsight. His green spacesuit struck an incongruous note against the\nbronze and red forest. \"They won't all look like ducks,\" he said\nsoberly.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe some will look like dragons. Don't get eaten by a dragon,\nJune,\" came Max's voice quietly into her earphones. \"Not while I still\nlove you.\" He came out of the trees carrying the blood sample kit, and\ntouched her glove with his, the grin on his ugly beloved face barely\nvisible in the mingled light and shade. A patch of sunlight struck a\ngreenish glint from his fishbowl helmet.\n  \n<doc-sep>June looked in stunned silence at the stranger leaning against the\ntree. Thirty-six light years\u2014thirty-six times six trillion miles\nof monotonous space travel\u2014to be told that the planet was already\nsettled! \"We didn't know there was a colony here,\" she said. \"It is not\non the map.\"\n  \n \n  \"We were afraid of that,\" the tall bronze man answered soberly. \"We\nhave been here three generations and yet no traders have come.\"\n  \n \n  Max shifted the kit strap on his shoulder and offered a hand. \"My name\nis Max Stark, M.D. This is June Walton, M.D., Hal Barton, M.D., and\nGeorge Barton, Hal's brother, also M.D.\"\n  \n \n  \"Patrick Mead is the name,\" smiled the man, shaking hands casually.\n\"Just a hunter and bridge carpenter myself. Never met any medicos\nbefore.\"\n  \n \n  The grip was effortless but even through her airproofed glove June\ncould feel that the fingers that touched hers were as hard as padded\nsteel.\n  \n \n  \"What\u2014what is the population of Minos?\" she asked.\n  \n \n  He looked down at her curiously for a moment before answering. \"Only\none hundred and fifty.\" He smiled. \"Don't worry, this isn't a city\nplanet yet. There's room for a few more people.\" He shook hands with\nthe Bartons quickly. \"That is\u2014you are people, aren't you?\" he asked\nstartlingly.\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" said Max with a poise that June admired.\n  \n \n  \"Well, you are all so\u2014so\u2014\" Patrick Mead's eyes roamed across the\nfaces of the group. \"So varied.\"\n  \n \n  They could find no meaning in that, and stood puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"I mean,\" Patrick Mead said into the silence, \"all these\u2014interesting\ndifferent hair colors and face shapes and so forth\u2014\" He made a vague\nwave with one hand as if he had run out of words or was anxious not to\ninsult them.\n  \n \n  \"Joke?\" Max asked, bewildered.\n  \n \n  June laid a hand on his arm. \"No harm meant,\" she said to him over the\nintercom. \"We're just as much of a shock to him as he is to us.\"\n  \n \n  She addressed a question to the tall colonist on outside sound. \"What\nshould a person look like, Mr. Mead?\"\n  \n \n  He indicated her with a smile. \"Like you.\"\n  \n \n  June stepped closer and stood looking up at him, considering her own\ndescription. She was tall and tanned, like him; had a few freckles,\nlike him; and wavy red hair, like his. She ignored the brightly\nhumorous blue eyes.\n  \n \n  \"In other words,\" she said, \"everyone on the planet looks like you and\nme?\"\n  \n \n  Patrick Mead took another look at their four faces and began to grin.\n\"Like me, I guess. But I hadn't thought of it before. I did not think\nthat people could have different colored hair or that noses could fit\nso many ways onto faces. I was judging by my own appearance, but I\nsuppose any fool can walk on his hands and say the world is upside\ndown!\" He laughed and sobered. \"But then why wear spacesuits? The air\nis breathable.\"\n  \n \n  \"For safety,\" June told him. \"We can't take any chances on plague.\"\n  \n \n  Pat Mead was wearing nothing but a loin cloth and his weapons, and the\nwind ruffled his hair. He looked comfortable, and they longed to take\noff the stuffy spacesuits and feel the wind against their own skins.\nMinos was like home, like Earth.... But they were strangers.\n  \n \n  \"Plague,\" Pat Mead said thoughtfully. \"We had one here. It came two\nyears after the colony arrived and killed everyone except the Mead\nfamilies. They were immune. I guess we look alike because we're all\nrelated, and that's why I grew up thinking that it is the only way\npeople can look.\"\n  \n \n \n   Plague.\n   \n  \"What was the disease?\" Hal Barton asked.\n  \n \n  \"Pretty gruesome, according to my father. They called it the melting\nsickness. The doctors died too soon to find out what it was or what to\ndo about it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have trained for more doctors, or sent to civilization for\nsome.\" A trace of impatience was in George Barton's voice.\n  \n \n  Pat Mead explained patiently, \"Our ship, with the power plant and all\nthe books we needed, went off into the sky to avoid the contagion,\nand never came back. The crew must have died.\" Long years of hardship\nwere indicated by that statement, a colony with electric power gone\nand machinery stilled, with key technicians dead and no way to replace\nthem. June realized then the full meaning of the primitive sheath knife\nand bow.\n  \n \n  \"Any recurrence of melting sickness?\" asked Hal Barton.\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Any other diseases?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a one.\"\n  \n \n  Max was eyeing the bronze red-headed figure with something approaching\nawe. \"Do you think all the Meads look like that?\" he said to June on\nthe intercom. \"I wouldn't mind being a Mead myself!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked on. A quarter of a mile back, the space ship\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  towered over the forest like a tapering skyscraper, and the people of\nthe ship looked out of the viewplates at fresh winds and sunlight and\nclouds, and they longed to be outside.\n  \n \n  But the likeness to Earth was danger, and the cool wind might be death,\nfor if the animals were like Earth animals, their diseases might be\nlike Earth diseases, alike enough to be contagious, different enough to\nbe impossible to treat. There was warning enough in the past. Colonies\nhad vanished, and traveled spaceways drifted with the corpses of ships\nwhich had touched on some plague planet.\n  \n \n  The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtight\nspacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion.\n  \n \n  The four medicos, for June Walton was also a doctor, filed through the\nalien homelike forest, walking softly, watching for motion among the\ncopper and purple shadows.\n  \n \n  They saw it suddenly, a lighter moving copper patch among the darker\nbrowns. Reflex action swung June's gun into line, and behind her\nsomeone's gun went off with a faint crackle of static, and made a hole\nin the leaves beside the specimen. Then for a while no one moved.\n  \n \n  This one looked like a man, a magnificently muscled, leanly graceful,\nhumanlike animal. Even in its callused bare feet, it was a head taller\nthan any of them. Red-haired, hawk-faced and darkly tanned, it stood\nbreathing heavily, looking at them without expression. At its side hung\na sheath knife, and a crossbow was slung across one wide shoulder.\n  \n \n  They lowered their guns.\n  \n \n  \"It needs a shave,\" Max said reasonably in their earphones, and he\nreached up to his helmet and flipped the switch that let his voice be\nheard. \"Something we could do for you, Mac?\"\n  \n \n  The friendly drawl was the first voice that had broken the forest\nsounds. June smiled suddenly. He was right. The strict logic of\nevolution did not demand beards; therefore a non-human would not be\nwearing a three day growth of red stubble.\n  \n \n  Still panting, the tall figure licked dry lips and spoke. \"Welcome to\nMinos. The Mayor sends greetings from Alexandria.\"\n  \n \n  \"English?\" gasped June.\n  \n \n  \"We were afraid you would take off again before I could bring word to\nyou.... It's three hundred miles.... We saw your scout plane pass\ntwice, but we couldn't attract its attention.\"\n  \n"

Red hair, dark blue eyes, tall....\n  \n \n  \"I've got a good figure,\" she said thoughtfully.\n  \n \n  Max turned at the door. \"Why this sudden interest in your looks?\" he\nasked suspiciously. \"Do we stand here and admire you, or do we finally\nget something to eat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait a minute.\" She went to a wall phone and dialed it carefully,\nusing a combination from the ship's directory. \"How're you doing, Pat?\"\n  \n \n  The phone picked up a hissing of water or spray. There was a startled\nchuckle. \"Voices, too! Hello, June. How do you tell a machine to go\njump in the lake?\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you hungry?\"\n  \n \n  \"No food since yesterday.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll have a banquet ready for you when you get out,\" she told Pat and\nhung up, smiling. Pat Mead's voice had a vitality and enjoyment which\nmade shipboard talk sound like sad artificial gaiety in contrast.\n  \n \n  They looked into the nearby small laboratory where twelve squealing\nhamsters were protestingly submitting to a small injection each of\nPat's blood. In most of them the injection was followed by one of\nantihistaminics and adaptives. Otherwise the hamster defense system\nwould treat all non-hamster cells as enemies, even the harmless human\nblood cells, and fight back against them violently.\n  \n \n  One hamster, the twelfth, was given an extra large dose of adaptive,\nso that if there were a disease, he would not fight it or the human\ncells, and thus succumb more rapidly.\n  \n \n  \"How ya doing, George?\" Max asked.\n  \n \n  \"Routine,\" George Barton grunted absently.\n  \n \n  On the way up the long spiral ramps to the dining hall, they passed a\nviewplate. It showed a long scene of mountains in the distance on the\nhorizon, and between them, rising step by step as they grew farther\naway, the low rolling hills, bronze and red with patches of clear green\nwhere there were fields.\n  \n \n  Someone was looking out, standing very still, as if she had been\nthere a long time\u2014Bess St. Clair, a Canadian woman. \"It looks like\nWinnipeg,\" she told them as they paused. \"When are you doctors going to\nlet us out of this blithering barberpole? Look,\" she pointed. \"See that\npatch of field on the south hillside, with the brook winding through\nit? I've staked that hillside for our house. When do we get out?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"May I go aboard?\" Pat asked hopefully.\n  \n \n  Max unslung the specimen kit from his shoulder, laid it on the carpet\nof plants that covered the ground and began to open it.\n  \n \n  \"Tests first,\" Hal Barton said. \"We have to find out if you people\nstill carry this so-called melting sickness. We'll have to de-microbe\nyou and take specimens before we let you on board. Once on, you'll be\nno good as a check for what the other Meads might have.\"\n  \n \n  Max was taking out a rack and a stand of preservative bottles and\nhypodermics.\n  \n \n  \"Are you going to jab me with those?\" Pat asked with interest.\n  \n \n  \"You're just a specimen animal to me, bud!\" Max grinned at Pat Mead,\nand Pat grinned back. June saw that they were friends already, the\ntall pantherish colonist, and the wry, black-haired doctor. She felt a\nstab of guilt because she loved Max and yet could pity him for being\nsmaller and frailer than Pat Mead.\n  \n \n  \"Lie down,\" Max told him, \"and hold still. We need two spinal fluid\nsamples from the back, a body cavity one in front, and another from the\narm.\"\n  \n \n  Pat lay down obediently. Max knelt, and, as he spoke, expertly swabbed\nand inserted needles with the smooth speed that had made him a fine\nnerve surgeon on Earth.\n  \n \n  High above them the scout helioplane came out of an opening in the ship\nand angled off toward the west, its buzz diminishing. Then, suddenly,\nit veered and headed back, and Reno Unrich's voice came tinnily from\ntheir earphones:\n  \n \n  \"What's that you've got? Hey, what are you docs doing down there?\" He\nbanked again and came to a stop, hovering fifty feet away. June could\nsee his startled face looking through the glass at Pat.\n  \n \n  Hal Barton switched to a narrow radio beam, explained rapidly and\npointed in the direction of Alexandria. Reno's plane lifted and flew\naway over the odd-colored forest.\n  \n \n  \"The plane will drop a note on your town, telling them you got\nthrough to us,\" Hal Barton told Pat, who was sitting up watching Max\ndexterously put the blood and spinal fluids into the right bottles\nwithout exposing them to air.\n  \n \n  \"We won't be free to contact your people until we know if they still\ncarry melting sickness,\" Max added. \"You might be immune so it doesn't\nshow on you, but still carry enough germs\u2014if that's what caused it\u2014to\nwipe out a planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you do carry melting sickness,\" said Hal Barton, \"we won't be able\nto mingle with your people until we've cleared them of the disease.\"\n  \n \n  \"Starting with me?\" Pat asked.\n  \n \n  \"Starting with you,\" Max told him ruefully, \"as soon as you step on\nboard.\"\n  \n \n  \"More needles?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, and a few little extras thrown in.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rough?\"\n  \n \n  \"It isn't easy.\"\n  \n \n  A few minutes later, standing in the stalls for spacesuit\ndecontamination, being buffeted by jets of hot disinfectant, bathed in\nglares of sterilizing ultraviolet radiation, June remembered that and\ncompared Pat Mead's treatment to theirs.\n  \n \n  In the\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  , stored carefully in sealed tanks and containers,\nwas the ultimate, multi-purpose cureall. It was a solution of enzymes\nso like the key catalysts of the human cell nucleus that it caused\nchemical derangement and disintegration in any non-human cell. Nothing\ncould live in contact with it but human cells; any alien intruder to\nthe body would die. Nucleocat Cureall was its trade name.\n  \n \n  But the cureall alone was not enough for complete safety. Plagues had\nbeen known to slay too rapidly and universally to be checked by human\ntreatment. Doctors are not reliable; they die. Therefore spaceways and\ninterplanetary health law demanded that ship equipment for guarding\nagainst disease be totally mechanical in operation, rapid and efficient.\n  \n \n  Somewhere near them, in a series of stalls which led around and\naround like a rabbit maze, Pat was being herded from stall to stall\nby peremptory mechanical voices, directed to soap and shower, ordered\nto insert his arm into a slot which took a sample of his blood, given\nsolutions to drink, bathed in germicidal ultraviolet, shaken by sonic\nblasts, breathing air thick with sprays of germicidal mists, being\ndirected to put his arms into other slots where they were anesthesized\nand injected with various immunizing solutions.\n  \n \n  Finally, he would be put in a room of high temperature and extreme\ndryness, and instructed to sit for half an hour while more fluids were\ndripped into his veins through long thin tubes.\n  \n \n  All legal spaceships were built for safety. No chance was taken of\nallowing a suspected carrier to bring an infection on board with him.\n  \n"

        "In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did\u2014everything you ate or drank\u2014in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and\u2014. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers\u2014Aspen, Taos and college towns\u2014thousands of\npeople sick\u2014but none in that valley in Tennessee\u2014and few government\nworkers\u2014just one girl in his office\u2014and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter\u2014and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command.

        "They walked on. A quarter of a mile back, the space ship\n   \n   Explorer\n   \n  towered over the forest like a tapering skyscraper, and the people of\nthe ship looked out of the viewplates at fresh winds and sunlight and\nclouds, and they longed to be outside.\n  \n \n  But the likeness to Earth was danger, and the cool wind might be death,\nfor if the animals were like Earth animals, their diseases might be\nlike Earth diseases, alike enough to be contagious, different enough to\nbe impossible to treat. There was warning enough in the past. Colonies\nhad vanished, and traveled spaceways drifted with the corpses of ships\nwhich had touched on some plague planet.\n  \n \n  The people of the ship waited while their doctors, in airtight\nspacesuits, hunted animals to test them for contagion.\n  \n \n  The four medicos, for June Walton was also a doctor, filed through the\nalien homelike forest, walking softly, watching for motion among the\ncopper and purple shadows.\n  \n \n  They saw it suddenly, a lighter moving copper patch among the darker\nbrowns. Reflex action swung June's gun into line, and behind her\nsomeone's gun went off with a faint crackle of static, and made a hole\nin the leaves beside the specimen. Then for a while no one moved.\n  \n \n  This one looked like a man, a magnificently muscled, leanly graceful,\nhumanlike animal. Even in its callused bare feet, it was a head taller\nthan any of them. Red-haired, hawk-faced and darkly tanned, it stood\nbreathing heavily, looking at them without expression. At its side hung\na sheath knife, and a crossbow was slung across one wide shoulder.\n  \n \n  They lowered their guns.\n  \n \n  \"It needs a shave,\" Max said reasonably in their earphones, and he\nreached up to his helmet and flipped the switch that let his voice be\nheard. \"Something we could do for you, Mac?\"\n  \n \n  The friendly drawl was the first voice that had broken the forest\nsounds. June smiled suddenly. He was right. The strict logic of\nevolution did not demand beards; therefore a non-human would not be\nwearing a three day growth of red stubble.\n  \n \n  Still panting, the tall figure licked dry lips and spoke. \"Welcome to\nMinos. The Mayor sends greetings from Alexandria.\"\n  \n \n  \"English?\" gasped June.\n  \n \n  \"We were afraid you would take off again before I could bring word to\nyou.... It's three hundred miles....

Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his\neyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from\nthe open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential\nsection of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination\nof the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n  \n \n  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come\nfrom within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a\nchair, or\u2014\n  \n \n  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland\nstarted to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his\nbrain....\n  \n \n  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through\nthe window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds\nsomewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of\nstretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he\nfroze, looking up\u2014for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He\nturned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  \n \n \n   This wasn't his room!\n   \n \n \n  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and\nthe shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green\nocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This\nwasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen\nplant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden\nbeneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n  \n \n  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.\nHis breathing quickened.\n   \n   Now\n   \n  he remembered what had happened during\nthe night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and\nthen\u2014what? Blackout....\n  \n \n  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n  \n \n  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As\na member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed\ninformation that other military powers would very much like to obtain.\nIt was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from\nthe heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done\nit.

Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line\u2014in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause\u2014by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word.\n  \n \n  \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.\n\"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n  \n"

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n<doc-sep>The violence of this thought evacuated his bowels. Eight days. Eight\n   \n   short\n   \n  days. It was wrong, impossible, but a fact. Even while in his\nmother's flesh some racial knowledge had told him he was being formed\nrapidly, shaped and propelled out swiftly.\n  \n \n  Birth was quick as a knife. Childhood was over in a flash. Adolescence\nwas a sheet of lightning. Manhood was a dream, maturity a myth, old age\nan inescapably quick reality, death a swift certainty.\n  \n \n  Eight days from now he'd stand half-blind, withering, dying, as his\nfather now stood, staring uselessly at his own wife and child.\n  \n \n  This day was an eighth part of his total life! He must enjoy every\nsecond of it. He must search his parents' thoughts for knowledge.\n  \n \n \n   Because in a few hours they'd be dead.\n   \n \n \n  This was so impossibly unfair. Was this all of life? In his prenatal\nstate hadn't he dreamed of\n   \n   long\n   \n  lives, valleys not of blasted stone\nbut green foliage and temperate clime? Yes! And if he'd dreamed then\nthere must be truth in the visions. How could he seek and find the long\nlife? Where? And how could he accomplish a life mission that huge and\ndepressing in eight short, vanishing days?\n  \n \n  How had his people gotten into such a condition?\n  \n \n  As if at a button pressed, he saw an image. Metal seeds, blown across\nspace from a distant green world, fighting with long flames, crashing\non this bleak planet. From their shattered hulls tumble men and women.\n  \n \n  When? Long ago. Ten thousand days. The crash victims hid in the cliffs\nfrom the sun. Fire, ice and floods washed away the wreckage of the\nhuge metal seeds. The victims were shaped and beaten like iron upon\na forge. Solar radiations drenched them. Their pulses quickened,\ntwo hundred, five hundred, a thousand beats a minute. Their skins\nthickened, their blood changed. Old age came rushing. Children were\nborn in the caves. Swifter, swifter, swifter the process. Like all this\nworld's wild life, the men and women from the crash lived and died in a\nweek, leaving children to do likewise.\n  \n \n  So this is life, thought Sim. It was not spoken in his mind, for\nhe knew no words, he knew only images, old memory, an awareness, a\ntelepathy that could penetrate flesh, rock, metal. So I'm the five\nthousandth in a long line of futile sons? What can I do to save myself\nfrom dying eight days from now? Is there escape?\n  \n \n  His eyes widened, another image came to focus.\n  \n \n  Beyond this valley of cliffs, on a low mountain lay a perfect,\nunscarred metal seed. A metal ship, not rusted or touched by the\navalanches. The ship was deserted, whole, intact. It was the only ship\nof all these that had crashed that was still a unit, still usable. But\nit was so far away. There was no one in it to help. This ship, then, on\nthe far mountain, was the destiny toward which he would grow. There was\nhis only hope of escape.\n  \n \n  His mind flexed.\n  \n \n  In this cliff, deep down in a confinement of solitude, worked a handful\nof scientists. To these men, when he was old enough and wise enough, he\nmust go. They, too, dreamed of escape, of long life, of green valleys\nand temperate weathers. They, too, stared longingly at that distant\nship upon its high mountain, its metal so perfect it did not rust or\nage.\n  \n \n  The cliff groaned.\n  \n \n  Sim's father lifted his eroded, lifeless face.\n  \n \n  \"Dawn's coming,\" he said.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Morning relaxed the mighty granite cliff muscles. It was the time of\nthe Avalanche.\n  \n \n  The tunnels echoed to running bare feet. Adults, children pushed with\neager, hungry eyes toward the outside dawn. From far out, Sim heard\na rumble of rock, a scream, a silence. Avalanches fell into valley.\nStones that had been biding their time, not quite ready to fall, for\na million years let go their bulks, and where they had begun their\njourney as single boulders they smashed upon the valley floor in a\nthousand shrapnels and friction-heated nuggets.\n  \n \n  Every morning at least one person was caught in the downpour.\n  \n \n  The cliff people dared the avalanches. It added one more excitement to\ntheir lives, already too short, too headlong, too dangerous.\n  \n \n  Sim felt himself seized up by his father. He was carried brusquely down\nthe tunnel for a thousand yards, to where the daylight appeared. There\nwas a shining insane light in his father's eyes. Sim could not move. He\nsensed what was going to happen. Behind his father, his mother hurried,\nbringing with her the little sister, Dark. \"Wait! Be careful!\" she\ncried to her husband.\n  \n \n  Sim felt his father crouch, listening.\n  \n \n  High in the cliff was a tremor, a shivering.\n  \n \n  \"Now!\" bellowed his father, and leaped out.\n  \n \n  An avalanche fell down at them!\n  \n \n  Sim had accelerated impressions of plunging walls, dust, confusion. His\nmother screamed! There was a jolting, a plunging.\n  \n \n  With one last step, Sim's father hurried him forward into the day. The\navalanche thundered behind him. The mouth of the cave, where mother and\nDark stood back out of the way, was choked with rubble and two boulders\nthat weighed a hundred pounds each.\n  \n \n  The storm thunder of the avalanche passed away to a trickle of sand.\nSim's father burst out into laughter. \"Made it! By the Gods! Made it\nalive!\" And he looked scornfully at the cliff and spat. \"Pagh!\"\n  \n \n  Mother and sister Dark struggled through the rubble. She cursed her\nhusband. \"Fool! You might have killed Sim!\"\n  \n \n  \"I may yet,\" retorted the father.\n  \n \n  Sim was not listening. He was fascinated with the remains of an\navalanche afront of the next tunnel. A blood stain trickled out from\nunder a rise of boulders, soaking into the ground. There was nothing\nelse to be seen. Someone else had lost the game.\n  \n \n  Dark ran ahead on lithe, supple feet, naked and certain.\n  \n \n  The valley air was like a wine filtered between mountains. The heaven\nwas a restive blue; not the pale scorched atmosphere of full day, nor\nthe bloated, bruised black-purple of night, a-riot with sickly shining\nstars.\n  \n \n  This was a tide pool. A place where waves of varying and violent\ntemperatures struck, receded. Now the tide pool was quiet, cool, and\nits life moved abroad.\n  \n \n  Laughter! Far away, Sim heard it. Why laughter? How could any of his\npeople find time for laughing? Perhaps later he would discover why.\n  \n \n  The valley suddenly blushed with impulsive color. Plant-life, thawing\nin the precipitant dawn, shoved out from most unexpected sources. It\nflowered as you watched. Pale green tendrils appeared on scoured rocks.\nSeconds later, ripe globes of fruit twitched upon the blade-tips.\nFather gave Sim over to mother and harvested the momentary, volatile\ncrop, thrust scarlet, blue, yellow fruits into a fur sack which hung at\nhis waist. Mother tugged at the moist new grasses, laid them on Sim's\ntongue.\n  \n \n  His senses were being honed to a fine edge. He stored knowledge\nthirstily. He understood love, marriage, customs, anger, pity, rage,\nselfishness, shadings and subtleties, realities and reflections. One\nthing suggested another. The sight of green plant life whirled his mind\nlike a gyroscope, seeking balance in a world where lack of time for\nexplanations made a mind seek and interpret on its own. The soft burden\nof food gave him knowledge of his system, of energy, of movement. Like\na bird newly cracking its way from a shell, he was almost a unit,\ncomplete, all-knowing. Heredity had done all this for him. He grew\nexcited with his ability.\n  \n"

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>As Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through\nglazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was\nnearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now\nhad become familiar.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you?\"\n  \n \n  Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was\nbeyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he\nreturned.\n  \n \n  \"We've made a terrible mistake. We\u2014\" The sounds faded in and out on\nPurnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different\ndirections. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered\nlogs and peer around and under them.\n  \n \n  \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky\nnow, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double\nshadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched\nthe creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of\nthe others.\n  \n \n  Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The\nbeach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering\nwhite square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie\never saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>They both saw it at the same time. And they watched, without speaking,\nboth knowing what was in the other's mind and heart. They watched the\ngiant four dimensional screens all through the city. A green, lush\nplanet showed bright and clear on them and there were ships standing\namong the trees and men walking through the grass, that moved gently\nlike the swells on a calm ocean, while into their minds came the\nthoughts projected from the screen:\n  \n \n  \"This will be your new home. It was found and then lost. But another\nexpedition will be sent out to find it again. Be of good hope.\nEverything will be all right.\"\n  \n \n  Michael turned from the window. \"So there's our evidence. Two thousand\nyears. All the others killed getting it. And with a simple twist, it\nbecomes a lie.\"\n  \n \n  Mary sat down and buried her face in her hands.\n  \n \n  \"What a terrible failure there's been here,\" said Michael. \"The\nneglect and destruction of a whole planet. It's like a family letting\ntheir home decay all around them, and living in smaller and smaller\nrooms of it, until at last the rooms are all gone, and since they\ncan't find another home, they all die in the ruins of the last room.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't face dying,\" Mary said quietly, \"squeezed in with all these\npeople, in this tomb they've made around the seas. I want to have the\nopen sky and the quiet away from those awful pounding pumps when I\ndie. I want the spread of the Earth all around and the clean air. I\nwant to be a real part of the Earth again.\"\n  \n \n  Michael barely nodded in agreement. He was standing very still now.\n  \n \n  And then there was the sound of the door opening.\n  \n \n  They both rose, like mourners at a funeral, and went into the council\nchambers.\n  \n"

        "All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one.

He lay wailing upon the cold cave\nstones. His blood beat through him a thousand pulses each minute. He\ngrew, steadily.\n  \n \n  Into his mouth his mother with feverish hands put the food. The\nnightmare of living was begun. Almost instantly at birth his eyes grew\nalert, and then, without half understanding why, filled with bright,\ninsistent terror. He gagged upon the food, choked and wailed. He looked\nabout, blindly.\n  \n \n  There was a thick fog. It cleared. The outlines of the cave appeared.\nAnd a man loomed up, insane and wild and terrible. A man with a dying\nface. Old, withered by winds, baked like adobe in the heat. The man was\ncrouched in a far corner of the cave, his eyes whitening to one side of\nhis face, listening to the far wind trumpeting up above on the frozen\nnight planet.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother, trembling, now and again, staring at the man, fed Sim\npebble-fruits, valley-grasses and ice-nipples broken from the cavern\nentrances, and eating, eliminating, eating again, he grew larger,\nlarger.\n  \n \n  The man in the corner of the cave was his father! The man's eyes were\nall that was alive in his face. He held a crude stone dagger in his\nwithered hands and his jaw hung loose and senseless.\n  \n \n  Then, with a widening focus, Sim saw the old people sitting in the\ntunnel beyond this living quarter. And as he watched, they began to die.\n  \n \n  Their agonies filled the cave. They melted like waxen images, their\nfaces collapsed inward on their sharp bones, their teeth protruded. One\nminute their faces were mature, fairly smooth, alive, electric. The\nnext minute a desication and burning away of their flesh occurred.\n  \n \n  Sim thrashed in his mother's grasp. She held him. \"No, no,\" she soothed\nhim, quietly, earnestly, looking to see if this, too, would cause her\nhusband to rise again.\n  \n \n  With a soft swift padding of naked feet, Sim's father ran across the\ncave. Sim's mother screamed. Sim felt himself torn loose from her\ngrasp. He fell upon the stones, rolling, shrieking with his new, moist\nlungs!\n  \n \n \n \n   With a soft padding of naked feet Sim's father ran across the cave.\n   \n \n \n \n  The webbed face of his father jerked over him, the knife was poised.\nIt was like one of those prenatal nightmares he'd had while still\nin his mother's flesh. In the next few blazing, impossible instants\nquestions flicked through his brain. The knife was high, suspended,\nready to destroy him. But the whole question of life in this cave, the\ndying people, the withering and the insanity, surged through Sim's\nnew, small head. How was it that he understood? A newborn child? Can a\nnewborn child think, see, understand, interpret? No. It was wrong! It\nwas impossible. Yet it was happening! To him. He had been alive an hour\nnow. And in the next instant perhaps dead!\n  \n \n  His mother flung herself upon the back of his father, and beat down the\nweapon. Sim caught the terrific backwash of emotion from both their\nconflicting minds. \"Let me kill him!\" shouted the father, breathing\nharshly, sobbingly. \"What has he to live for?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no!\" insisted the mother, and her body, frail and old as it was,\nstretched across the huge body of the father, tearing at his weapon.\n\"He must live! There may be a future for him! He may live longer than\nus, and be young!\"\n  \n \n  The father fell back against a stone crib. Lying there, staring,\neyes glittering, Sim saw another figure inside that stone crib. A\ngirl-child, quietly feeding itself, moving its delicate hands to\nprocure food. His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n"

        "He could tell from their looks that the others did, but couldn't bring\nthemselves to put it into words.\n  \n \n  \"I suppose it's the time-scale and the value-scale that are so hard for\nus to accept,\" he said softly. \"Much more, even, than the size-scale.\nThe thought that there are creatures in the Universe to whom the whole\ncareer of Man\u2014in fact, the whole career of life\u2014is no more than a few\nthousand or hundred thousand years.

I am speaking to you through a number of\ntelepathically sensitive individuals among your kind. In each case my\nthoughts suit themselves to your level of comprehension. I inhabit the\ndisguised and jetless spaceship which is your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Celeste swayed a step forward. \"Baby....\" she implored.\n  \n \n  Dotty went on, without giving her a glance, \"It is true that we planted\nthe seeds of life on some of these planets simply as part of our\ncamouflage, just as we gave them a suitable environment for each. And\nit is true that now we must let most of that life be destroyed. Our\nhiding place has been discovered, our pursuers are upon us, and we must\nmake one last effort to escape or do battle, since we firmly believe\nthat the principle of mental privacy to which we have devoted our\nexistence is perhaps the greatest good in the whole Universe.\n  \n \n  \"But it is not true that we look with contempt upon you.

Presumably my world\nwas one of the first they stopped at. They weren't used to roughing\nit, so they built more elaborately than they did later on. One-story\nstructures and that's how we can guess at their size. The doorways were\nforty feet high.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very large,\" agreed Taphetta. It was difficult to tell whether he was\nimpressed. \"What did you find in the ruins?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" said Emmer. \"There were buildings there and that was all,\nnot a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture. They covered\na route estimated at thirty thousand light-years in less than five\nthousand years\u2014and not one of them died that we have a record of.\"\n  \n \n  \"A faster-than-light drive and an extremely long life,\" mused Taphetta.\n\"But they didn't leave any information for their descendants. Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows? Their mental processes were certainly far different from\nours. They may have thought we'd be better off without it. We do know\nthey were looking for a special kind of planet, like Earth, because\nthey visited so many of that type, yet different from it because they\nnever stayed. They were pretty special people themselves, big and\nlong-lived, and maybe they couldn't survive on any planet they found.\nPerhaps they had ways of determining there wasn't the kind of planet\nthey needed in the entire Milky Way. Their science was tremendously\nadvanced and when they learned that, they may have altered their germ\nplasm and left us, hoping that some of us would survive. Most of us\ndid.\"\n  \n \n  \"This special planet sounds strange,\" murmured Taphetta.\n  \n \n  \"Not really,\" said Emmer. \"Fifty human races reached space travel\nindependently and those who did were scattered equally among early and\nlate species. It's well known that individuals among my people are\noften as bright as any of Halden's or Meredith's, but as a whole we\ndon't have the total capacity that later Man does, and yet we're as\nadvanced in civilization. The difference? It must lie somewhere in the\nplanets we live on and it's hard to say just what it is.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to those who didn't develop space travel?\" asked\nTaphetta.\n  \n \n  \"We helped them,\" said Emmer.\n  \n \n  And they had, no matter who or what they were, biologically late\nor early, in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of\natomic\u2014because they were human. That was sometimes a frightening thing\nfor non-humans, that the race stuck together. They weren't actually\naggressive, but their total number was great and they held themselves\naloof. The unknown ancestor again. Who else had such an origin and, it\nwas tacitly assumed, such a destiny?\n  \n"

His sister.\n  \n \n  The mother wrenched the dagger from her husband's grasp, stood up,\nweeping and pushing back her cloud of stiffening gray hair. Her mouth\ntrembled and jerked. \"I'll kill you!\" she said, glaring down at her\nhusband. \"Leave my children alone.\"\n  \n \n  The old man spat tiredly, bitterly, and looked vacantly into the stone\ncrib, at the little girl. \"One-eighth of\n   \n   her\n   \n  life's over, already,\"\nhe gasped. \"And she doesn't know it. What's the use?\"\n  \n \n  As Sim watched, his own mother seemed to shift and take a tortured,\nsmoke-like form. The thin bony face broke out into a maze of wrinkles.\nShe was shaken with pain and had to sit by him, shuddering and cuddling\nthe knife to her shriveled breasts. She, like the old people in the\ntunnel, was aging, dying.\n  \n \n  Sim cried steadily. Everywhere he looked was horror. A mind came to\nmeet his own. Instinctively he glanced toward the stone crib. Dark, his\nsister, returned his glance. Their minds brushed like straying fingers.\nHe relaxed somewhat. He began to learn.\n  \n \n  The father sighed, shut his lids down over his green eyes. \"Feed the\nchild,\" he said, exhaustedly. \"Hurry. It is almost dawn and it is our\nlast day of living, woman. Feed him. Make him grow.\"\n  \n \n  Sim quieted, and images, out of the terror, floated to him.\n  \n \n  This was a planet next to the sun. The nights burned with cold, the\ndays were like torches of fire. It was a violent, impossible world. The\npeople lived in the cliffs to escape the incredible ice and the day of\nflame. Only at dawn and sunset was the air breath-sweet, flower-strong,\nand then the cave peoples brought their children out into a stony,\nbarren valley. At dawn the ice thawed into creeks and rivers, at sunset\nthe day-fires died and cooled. In the intervals of even, livable\ntemperature the people lived, ran, played, loved, free of the caverns;\nall life on the planet jumped, burst into life. Plants grew instantly,\nbirds were flung like pellets across the sky. Smaller, legged animal\nlife rushed frantically through the rocks; everything tried to get\nits living down in the brief hour of respite.\n  \n \n  It was an unbearable planet. Sim understood this, a matter of hours\nafter birth. Racial memory bloomed in him. He would live his entire\nlife in the caves, with two hours a day outside. Here, in stone\nchannels of air he would talk, talk incessantly with his people, sleep\nnever, think, think and lie upon his back, dreaming; but never sleeping.\n  \n \n \n   And he would live exactly eight days.\n   \n \n<doc-sep>All day the sun seemed to blaze and erupt into the valley. Sim could\nnot see it, but the vivid pictorials in his parents' minds were\nsufficient evidence of the nature of the day fire. The light ran like\nmercury, sizzling and roasting the caves, poking inward, but never\npenetrating deeply enough. It lighted the caves. It made the hollows of\nthe cliff comfortably warm.\n  \n \n  Sim fought to keep his parents young. But no matter how hard he fought\nwith mind and image, they became like mummies before him. His father\nseemed to dissolve from one stage of oldness to another. This is what\nwill happen to me soon, though Sim in terror.\n  \n \n  Sim grew upon himself. He felt the digestive-eliminatory movements\nof his body. He was fed every minute, he was continually swallowing,\nfeeding. He began to fit words to images and processes. Such a word was\nlove. It was not an abstraction, but a process, a stir of breath, a\nsmell of morning air, a flutter of heart, the curve of arm holding him,\nthe look in the suspended face of his mother. He saw the processes,\nthen searched behind her suspended face and there was the word, in her\nbrain, ready to use. His throat prepared to speak. Life was pushing\nhim, rushing him along toward oblivion.\n  \n \n  He sensed the expansion of his fingernails, the adjustments of his\ncells, the profusion of his hair, the multiplication of his bones and\nsinew, the grooving of the soft pale wax of his brain. His brain at\nbirth as clear as a circle of ice, innocent, unmarked, was, an instant\nlater, as if hit with a thrown rock, cracked and marked and patterned\nin a million crevices of thought and discovery.\n  \n \n  His sister, Dark, ran in and out with other little hothouse children,\nforever eating. His mother trembled over him, not eating, she had no\nappetite, her eyes were webbed shut.\n  \n \n  \"Sunset,\" said his father, at last.\n  \n \n  The day was over. The light faded, a wind sounded.\n  \n \n  His mother arose. \"I want to see the outside world once more ... just\nonce more....\" She stared blindly, shivering.\n  \n \n  His father's eyes were shut, he lay against the wall.\n  \n \n  \"I cannot rise,\" he whispered faintly. \"I cannot.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" The mother croaked, the girl came running. \"Here,\" and Sim was\nhanded to the girl. \"Hold to Sim, Dark, feed him, care for him.\" She\ngave Sim one last fondling touch.\n  \n \n  Dark said not a word, holding Sim, her great green eyes shining wetly.\n  \n \n  \"Go now,\" said the mother. \"Take him out into the sunset time. Enjoy\nyourselves. Pick foods, eat. Play.\"\n  \n \n  Dark walked away without looking back. Sim twisted in her grasp,\nlooking over her shoulder with unbelieving, tragic eyes. He cried out\nand somehow summoned from his lips the first word of his existence.\n  \n \n  \"Why...?\"\n  \n \n  He saw his mother stiffen. \"The child spoke!\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye,\" said his father. \"Did you hear what he said?\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard,\" said the mother quietly.\n  \n \n  The last thing Sim saw of his living parents was his mother weakly,\nswayingly, slowly moving across the floor to lie beside her silent\nhusband. That was the last time he ever saw them move.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  The night came and passed and then started the second day.\n  \n \n  The bodies of all those who had died during the night were carried in a\nfuneral procession to the top of a small hill. The procession was long,\nthe bodies numerous.\n  \n \n  Dark walked in the procession, holding the newly walking Sim by one\nhand. Only an hour before dawn Sim had learned to walk.\n  \n \n  At the top of the hill, Sim saw once again the far off metal seed.\nNobody ever looked at it, or spoke of it. Why? Was there some reason?\nWas it a mirage? Why did they not run toward it? Worship it? Try to get\nto it and fly away into space?\n  \n \n  The funeral words were spoken. The bodies were placed upon the ground\nwhere the sun, in a few minutes, would cremate them.\n  \n \n  The procession then turned and ran down the hill, eager to have their\nfew minutes of free time running and playing and laughing in the sweet\nair.\n  \n \n  Dark and Sim, chattering like birds, feeding among the rocks, exchanged\nwhat they knew of life. He was in his second day, she in her third.\nThey were driven, as always, by the mercurial speed of their lives.\n  \n \n  Another piece of his life opened wide.\n  \n \n  Fifty young men ran down from the cliffs, holding sharp stones and rock\ndaggers in their thick hands. Shouting, they ran off toward distant\nblack, low lines of small rock cliffs.\n  \n \n  \"War!\"\n  \n \n  The thought stood in Sim's brain. It shocked and beat at him. These men\nwere running to fight, to kill, over there in those small black cliffs\nwhere other people lived.\n  \n \n  But why? Wasn't life short enough without fighting, killing?\n  \n \n  From a great distance he heard the sound of conflict, and it made his\nstomach cold. \"Why, Dark, why?\"\n  \n \n  Dark didn't know. Perhaps they would understand tomorrow. Now, there\nwas the business of eating to sustain and support their lives. Watching\nDark was like seeing a lizard forever flickering its pink tongue,\nforever hungry.\n  \n \n  Pale children ran on all sides of them. One beetle-like boy scuttled up\nthe rocks, knocking Sim aside, to take from him a particularly luscious\nred berry he had found growing under an outcrop.\n  \n \n  The child ate hastily of the fruit before Sim could gain his feet. Then\nSim hurled himself unsteadily, the two of them fell in a ridiculous\njumble, rolling, until Dark pried them, squalling, apart.\n  \n \n  Sim bled. A part of him stood off, like a god, and said, \"This should\nnot be. Children should not be this way. It is wrong!\"\n  \n \n  Dark slapped the little intruding boy away. \"Get on!\" she cried.\n\"What's your name, bad one?\"\n  \n \n  \"Chion!\" laughed the boy. \"Chion, Chion, Chion!\"\n  \n \n  Sim glared at him with all the ferocity in his small, unskilled\nfeatures. He choked. This was his enemy. It was as if he'd waited\nfor an enemy of person as well as scene. He had already understood\nthe avalanches, the heat, the cold, the shortness of life, but these\nwere things of places, of scene\u2014mute, extravagant manifestations of\nunthinking nature, not motivated save by gravity and radiation. Here,\nnow, in this stridulent Chion he recognized a thinking enemy!\n  \n \n  Chion darted off, turned at a distance, tauntingly crying:\n  \n \n  \"Tomorrow I will be big enough to kill you!\"\n  \n \n  And he vanished around a rock.\n  \n \n  More children ran, giggling, by Sim. Which of them would be friends,\nenemies? How could friends and enemies come about in this impossible,\nquick life time? There was no time to make either, was there?\n  \n \n  Dark, as if knowing his thoughts, drew him away. As they searched for\ndesired foods, she whispered fiercely in his ear. \"Enemies are made\nover things like stolen foods; gifts of long grasses make friends.\nEnemies come, too, from opinions and thoughts. In five seconds you've\nmade an enemy for life. Life's so short enemies must be made quickly.\"\nAnd she laughed with an irony strange for one so young, who was growing\nolder before her rightful time. \"You must fight to protect yourself.\nOthers, superstitious ones, will try killing you. There is a belief, a\nridiculous belief, that if one kills another, the murderer partakes of\nthe life energy of the slain, and therefore will live an extra day. You\nsee? As long as that is believed, you're in danger.\"\n  \n \n  But Sim was not listening. Bursting from a flock of delicate girls who\ntomorrow would be tall, quieter, and who day after that would gain\nbreasts and the next day take husbands, Sim caught sight of one small\ngirl whose hair was a violet blue flame.\n  \n \n  She ran past, brushed Sim, their bodies touched. Her eyes, white as\nsilver coins, shone at him. He knew then that he'd found a friend, a\nlove, a wife, one who'd a week from now lie with him atop the funeral\npyre as sunlight undressed their flesh from bone.\n  \n \n  Only the glance, but it held them in mid-motion, one instant.\n  \n \n  \"Your name?\" he shouted after her.\n  \n \n  \"Lyte!\" she called laughingly back.\n  \n \n  \"I'm Sim,\" he answered, confused and bewildered.\n  \n \n  \"Sim!\" she repeated it, flashing on. \"I'll remember!\"\n  \n \n  Dark nudged his ribs. \"Here,\n   \n   eat\n   \n  ,\" she said to the distracted boy.\n\"Eat or you'll never get big enough to catch her.\"\n  \n \n  From nowhere, Chion appeared, running by. \"Lyte!\" he mocked, dancing\nmalevolently along and away. \"Lyte! I'll remember Lyte, too!\"\n  \n \n  Dark stood tall and reed slender, shaking her dark ebony clouds of\nhair, sadly. \"I see your life before you, little Sim. You'll need\nweapons soon to fight for this Lyte one. Now, hurry\u2014the sun's coming!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back to the caves.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n"

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The chance of mass slaughter was their eternal nightmare.\n  \n \n \n  How black is the blackest treachery? Is the most callous\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\n  \n \n  Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\nhe reached the village.\n  \n \n  He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\n  \n \n  He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n  \n \n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n  \n \n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n  \n \n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n  \n \n  \"What happened here?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\nthey're gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you stayed here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To die,\" the old man said, without self-pity. \"I'm too old to flee, too\nold to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon. Or it may be so shadowed\nby Time's relentless tyranny that the changes which have occurred in his\nabsence can lead only to tragedy and despair. This rarely discerning, warmly\nhuman story by a brilliant newcomer to the science fantasy field is told\nwith no pulling of punches, and its adroit unfolding will astound you.\n   \n \n \n \n   the\n    \n   hoofer\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n   \n \n \n \n   A space rover has no business with a family. But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ...

        "Three days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.\n  \n \n  The caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day.\nTheir water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to\nreach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\nbacks.\n  \n \n  And then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\nSteve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the\nturbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but\nhad assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had\ndone so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.\n  \n \n  \"But why?\" someone asked. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  At first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the\nday before said: \"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money\u2014with the\nKumaji.\"\n  \n \n  None of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying\nanything, and Steve squeezed her hand.\n  \n \n  \"Now, wait a minute,\" one of Whiting's friends said.\n  \n \n  \"Wait, nothing.\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the\ncolony. \"I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for\nthat money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the\nKumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I was told,\" Steve said.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Gort went on relentlessly. \"Then this is what I figure must\nhave happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally\ndecided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's\n'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the\nKumaji, they won't just give it to him\u2014not by a long sight.\"\n  \n \n  \"No?\" someone asked.\n  \n \n  \"No sir. They'll trade. For our location. And if Whiting went off like\nthat without even saying good-bye to his girl here, my guess is he'll\nmake the trade.\" His voice reflected some bitterness.\n  \n<doc-sep>They fell together on the sand, the guard still struggling. Steve\ncouldn't release his throat to grab the pike. The guard stabbed out\nawkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned,\nbut Steve hardly heard him.\n  \n \n  When the guard's legs stopped drumming, Steve released him. The man was\neither dead or so close to death that he would be out for hours. Steve\nhad never killed a man before, had never in violence and with intent to\nkill attacked a man....\n  \n \n  \"Steve!\"\n  \n \n  It was Mary, calling his name and crying.\n  \n \n  \"It's Dad. Dad was\u2014hit. The pike, a wild stab. He's hit bad\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Steve crawled over to them. It was very dark. He could barely make out\nTobias Whiting's pain-contorted face.\n  \n \n  \"My stomach,\" Whiting said, gasping for breath. \"The pain....\"\n  \n \n  Steve probed with his hands, found the wound. Blood was rushing out. He\ncouldn't stop it and he knew it and he thought Whiting knew it too. He\ntouched Mary's hand, and held it. Mary sobbed against him, crying\nsoftly.\n  \n \n  \"You two ...\" Whiting gasped. \"You two ... Mary, Mary girl. Is\u2014he\u2014what\nyou want?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Dad. Oh, yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"You can get her out of here, Cantwell?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so,\" Steve said.\n  \n \n  \"Then go. Go while you can. I'll tell them\u2014due south. The Earthmen are\nheading due south. They'll go\u2014south. They won't find the caravan.\nYou'll\u2014all\u2014get away. If it's\u2014what you want, Mary.\"\n  \n \n  She leaned away from Steve, kissing her father. She asked Steve: \"Isn't\nthere anything we can do for him?\"\n  \n \n  Steve shook his head. \"But he's got to live long enough to tell them, to\ndeceive them.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll live long enough,\" Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he\nwould. \"Luck to\u2014all of you. From a\u2014very foolish\u2014man....\"\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Home again,\" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks\nlater and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt\nbeside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.\n  \n \n  \"The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,\" she went\non as they climbed the steps, \"but nowhere was there any place as\nbeautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.\"\n  \n \n  Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the\nexposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car\nand the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living\nquarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the\nchaos of his cool Orthan brain.\n  \n \n  Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows\nand report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,\nincluding Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force\nto wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,\nof course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be\nlanded. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,\nimperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the\nHordes?\n  \n \n  Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the\ndead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three\nmonths he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed\nfor reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady\nglory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had\nexperienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against\nthe wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt\ndivision of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer\nthought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty\nadded zest to every day's life.\n  \n \n  The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to\nthe Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,\nwould one new world\u2014or a hundred\u2014populated by the Hordes add to\nthe progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan\ncivilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain\nwell-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast\nmechanical hives.\n  \n \n  There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had\ncaught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath\nthem. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid\nred the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and\ncactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,\nwho nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept\u2014the son\nof Ellen and the man he had destroyed.\n  \n \n  Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better\nof his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to\nblast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the\nroad toward the beach.\n  \n \n  The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly\nbut they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the\ndoor and called after him.\n  \n \n  \"Hurry home, dear,\" she said. \"I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.\"\n  \n \n  He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she\nwould have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of\nperson when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a\nhand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.\n  \n \n  Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the\nautumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that\nlived no longer. He mentally titled it: \"Rustlers' Riot\" and blocked\nin the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the\ncareless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be\nsapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never\nbe written, but he toyed with the idea.\n  \n \n  So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from\nthe unquestioning worship of the Horde!\n  \n"

The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\n  \n \n  He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n  \n \n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n  \n \n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n  \n \n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n  \n \n  \"What happened here?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\nthey're gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you stayed here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To die,\" the old man said, without self-pity. \"I'm too old to flee, too\nold to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ... THE END\n  \n \n<doc-sep>When I got home, the house was empty. George Prime wasn't in his\ncloset. And Marge wasn't in the house.\n  \n \n  They were gone.\n  \n \n  I started to call the police, but caught myself just in time. I\ncouldn't very well complain to the cops that my wife had run off with\nan android.\n  \n \n  Worse yet, I could get twenty years for having an illegal Prime\nwandering around.\n  \n \n  I sat down and poured myself a stiff drink.\n  \n \n  My own wife deserting me for a pile of bearings.\n  \n \n  It was indecent.\n  \n \n  Then I heard the front door open and there was Marge, her arms full of\ngrocery bundles. \"Why, darling! You're home early!\"\n  \n \n  I just blinked for a moment. Then I said, \"You're still here!\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course. Where did you think I'd be?\"\n  \n \n  \"But I thought\u2014I mean the ticket office\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She set down the bundles and kissed me and looked up into my eyes,\nalmost smiling, half reproachful. \"You didn't really think I'd go\nrunning off with something out of a lab, did you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Then\u2014you knew?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly I knew, silly. You didn't do a very good job of instructing\nhim, either. You gave him far too much latitude. Let him have ideas of\nhis own and all that. And next thing I knew, he was trying to get me to\nrun off with him to Hawaii or someplace.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bermuda,\" I said.\n  \n \n  And then Marge was in my arms, kissing me and snuggling her cheek\nagainst my chest.\n  \n \n  \"Even though he looked like you, I knew he couldn't be,\" she said. \"He\nwas like you, but he wasn't\n   \n   you\n   \n  , darling. And all I ever want is you.\nI just never appreciated you before....\"\n  \n \n  I held her close and tried to keep my hands from shaking. George\nFaircloth, Idiot, I thought. She'd never been more beautiful. \"But what\ndid you do with him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I sent him back to the factory, naturally. They said they could blot\nhim out and use him over again. But let's not talk about that any more.\nWe've got more interesting things to discuss.\"\n  \n \n  Maybe we had, but we didn't waste a lot of time talking. It was the\nMarge I'd once known and I was beginning to wonder how I could have\nbeen so wrong about her. In fact unless my memory was getting awfully\nporous, the old Marge was\n   \n   never\n   \n  like this\u2014\n  \n \n  I kissed her tenderly and ran my hands through her hair, and felt\nthe depression with my fore-finger, and then I knew what had really\nhappened.\n  \n \n  That Marge always had been a sly one.\n  \n \n  I wondered how she was liking things in Bermuda.\n  \n"

More water.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Steve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\nsand to where the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  were hobbled for the night. He hardly\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  .\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\n   \n   thlot's\n   \n  bare back in front of him,\nand they glided off across the sand.\n  \n \n  Pursuit was disorganized\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\n  \n \n  Two days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\n\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can tell them this,\" Steve said. \"Your father died a hero's death,\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"And not\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\nmake a mistake, can't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I love you, Steve. I love you.\"\n  \n \n  Then they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\nreach Oasis City in safety.\n  \n \n  With Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\n  \n<doc-sep>The first night, they camped in the lee of low sandhills. The second\nnight they found a small spring with brackish but drinkable water. On\nthe third day, having covered half the distance to the Kumaji\nsettlement, they began to encounter Kumaji patrols, on foot or\n   \n   thlotback\n   \n  , the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the\nsands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding.\nSteve and Mary hardly spoke. Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond\ngrew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out\nhere with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her\nheart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in\norder to regain his fortune.\n  \n \n  On the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and\nmade their way toward it. It had come much further than Steve had\nexpected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he\nescaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the\nKumaji encampment by now.\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't seem badly damaged,\" Mary said.\n  \n \n  The platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of\nthe rotors twisted, its end buried in sand. Tobias Whiting wasn't there.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Steve said. \"It's hardly damaged at all. Your father got out of it\nall right.\"\n  \n \n  \"To go\u2014to them?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think so, Mary. I don't want to pass judgment until we're sure. I'm\nsorry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Steve! Steve! What will we do? What\n   \n   can\n   \n  we do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Find him, if it isn't too late. Come on.\"\n  \n \n  \"North?\"\n  \n \n  \"North.\"\n  \n \n  \"And if by some miracle we find him?\"\n  \n \n  Steve said nothing. The answer\u2014capture or death\u2014was obvious. But you\ncouldn't tell that to a traitor's daughter, could you?\n  \n \n  As it turned out, they did not find Tobias Whiting through their own\nefforts. Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were\nspotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on\ntheir\n   \n   thlots\n   \n  . Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel\naside. \"They'd kill us,\" he said. \"We can only surrender.\"\n  \n \n  They were hobbled and led painfully across the sand. They were taken\nthat way to a small Kumaji encampment, and thrust within a circular\ntent.\n  \n \n  Tobias Whiting was in there.\n  \n"

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The chance of mass slaughter was their eternal nightmare.\n  \n \n \n  How black is the blackest treachery? Is the most callous\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\n  \n \n  Only the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\nhe reached the village.\n  \n \n  He poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\n  \n \n  He walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\nin a\n   \n   Kumaji\n   \n  raid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\ntime as a boy.\n  \n \n  He went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\n  \n \n  He hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\n  \n \n  Poisoned.\n  \n \n  He spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\n  \n \n  The well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\u2014too\nlate for anything.\n  \n \n  He went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\nscurried away.\n  \n \n  \"Earthman!\" a quavering voice called.\n  \n \n  Steve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\n  \n \n  Steve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\ncanteen and said:\n  \n \n  \"What happened here?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're gone. All gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but what happened?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Kumaji\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You're Kumaji.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my town,\" the old man said. \"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\nthey're gone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you stayed here\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"To die,\" the old man said, without self-pity. \"I'm too old to flee, too\nold to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Maota laughed, then sobered quickly. \"You lie.\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"If I had this machine, could I travel as you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I'll kill you and take yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"It would not work for you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Each machine is tailored for each person.\"\n  \n \n  The old man hung his head. He looked down into the black, charred\nhole. He walked all around the hole. He kicked at the sand, looking\nhalf-heartedly again for the book.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Michaelson said. \"I'm sure I've convinced you that I'm human.\nWhy not have a try at negotiating our differences?\"\n  \n \n  He looked up. His expressive eyes, deep, resigned, studied Michaelson's\nface. Finally he shook his head sadly. \"When we first met I hoped we\ncould think the ancient thoughts together. But our paths diverge. We\nhave finished, you and I.\"\n  \n \n  He turned and started off, shoulders slumped dejectedly.\n  \n \n  Michaelson caught up to him. \"Are you leaving the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going?\"\n  \n \n  \"Away. Far away.\" Maota looked off toward the hills, eyes distant.\n  \n \n  \"Don't be stupid, old man. How can you go far away and not leave the\ncity?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are many directions. You would not understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"East. West. North. South. Up. Down.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, no. There is another direction. Come, if you must see.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson followed him far down the street. They came to a section of\nthe city he had not seen before. Buildings were smaller, spires dwarfed\nagainst larger structures. Here a path was packed in the sand, leading\nto a particular building.\n  \n \n  Michaelson said, \"This is where you live?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Maota went inside. Michaelson stood in the entrance and looked around.\nThe room was clean, furnished with hand made chairs and a bed. Who is\nthis old man, he thought, far from his people, living alone, choosing\na life of solitude among ancient ruins but not touching them? Above\nthe bed a \"clock\" was fastened to the wall, Michaelson remembered his\nfright\u2014thinking of the warmth where warmth should not be.\n  \n \n  Maota pointed to it.\n  \n \n  \"You asked about this machine,\" he said. \"Now I will tell you.\" He laid\nhis hand against it. \"Here is power to follow another direction.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He whirled, staring out across the fields to his left. Why, the tractor\nshed had stood just fifty feet from the house!\n  \n \n  No, he'd torn it down. The tractor was in town, being overhauled and\nall. He was leaving it there until he had use for it.\n  \n \n  He went on toward the road, his head beginning to throb. Why should\na man his age, hardly sick at all since he was a kid, suddenly start\nlosing hold this way? Edna was worried. The Shanks had noticed it too.\n  \n \n  He was at the supply bin\u2014like an old-fashioned wood bin; a box with\na sloping flap lid. Deliveries of food and clothing and home medicines\nand other things were left here. You wrote down what you needed, and\nthey left it\u2014or whatever they allowed you\u2014with a bill. You paid the\nbill by leaving money in the bin, and the next week you found a receipt\nand your new stuff and your new bill. And almost always you found some\nmoney from the government, for not planting wheat or not planting corn.\nIt came out just about even.\n  \n \n  He hauled out a sack of flour, half the amount of sugar Edna had\nordered, some dried fruit, a new Homekit Medicine Shelf. He carried it\ninto the house, and noticed a slip of paper pinned to the sugar bag. A\ntelevision program guide.\n  \n \n  Edna hustled over excitedly. \"Anything good on this week, Harry?\"\n  \n \n  He looked down the listings, and frowned. \"All old movies. Still only\none channel. Still only from nine to eleven at night.\" He gave it to\nher, turned away; then stopped and waited. He'd said the same thing\nlast week. And she had said the films were all new to her.\n  \n \n  She said it now. \"Why Harry, I've never seen this movie with Clark\nGable. Nor the comedy with Red Skeleton. Nor the other five neither.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm gonna lie down,\" he said flatly. He turned and stepped forward,\nand found himself facing the stove. Not the door to the hall; the\nstove. \"But the door....\" he began. He cut himself short. He turned and\nsaw the door a few feet to the left, beside the table. He went there\nand out and up the stairs (they too had moved; they too weren't right)\nand into the bedroom and lay down. The bedroom was wrong. The bed was\nwrong. The windows were wrong.\n  \n \n  The world was wrong! Lord, the whole damned world was wrong!\n  \n"

        "It took three weeks to make the return trip to Swamp City. The Varsoom\nfollowed us far beyond the frontier of their country like an unseen\narmy in the throes of laughing gas. Not until we reached Level Five did\nthe last chuckle fade into the distance.\n  \n \n  All during that trek back, Grannie sat in the dugout, staring silently\nout before her.\n  \n \n  But when we reached Swamp City, the news was flung at us from all\nsides. One newspaper headline accurately told the story: DOCTOR\nUNIVERSE BID FOR SYSTEM DICTATORSHIP SQUELCHED BY RIDICULE OF UNSEEN\nAUDIENCE. QUIZ MASTER NOW IN HANDS OF I.P. COUP FAILURE.\n  \n \n  \"Grannie,\" I said that night as we sat again in a rear booth of THE\nJET, \"what are you going to do now? Give up writing science fiction?\"\n  \n \n  She looked at me soberly, then broke into a smile.\n  \n \n  \"Just because some silly form of life that can't even be seen doesn't\nappreciate it? I should say not. Right now I've got an idea for a swell\nyarn about Mars. Want to come along while I dig up some background\nmaterial?\"\n  \n \n  I shook my head. \"Not me,\" I said.\n  \n \n  But I knew I would.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>The problem of where to put the line between dream and reality began to\nworry Bruce. He would wake up and listen and take down what Terrence\nwas saying, and then go to sleep again with increasing expectancy. His\ndream took on continuity. He could return to the point where he had\nleft it, and it was the same\u2014allowing even for the time difference\nnecessitated by his periods of sleep.\n  \n \n  He met people in the dreams, two girls and a man. They had names:\nPietro, Marlene, Helene.\n  \n \n  Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to\nhim all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could\nalso talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense.\nConsistently, they made sense.\n  \n \n  The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green\nvalleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing\ntheir branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there\nwere pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them\nthat were alive and intelligent and soft and warm and wonderful to know.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   ... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting,\nshadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the\ndelirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love\u2014and all our\nown!\u2014than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known....\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the\ndreams.\n  \n \n  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would\nlook out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing\nbut seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.\n  \n \n  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again.\nThe dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"\n  \n \n  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he\ncouldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would\ndie. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into\nhimself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one\ncompensation\u2014he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them\nwho had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way\nacross the Cosmos.\n  \n \n  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him\nmuch more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He\ncould switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure\nto be five hundred thousand feet! It\n   \n   is\n   \n  impossible. We keep climbing\nand now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is\ngoing up and up\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the\nmatter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps\nlaughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it.\nWomen don't have real guts.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled\nsoftly at the door.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember\nhow you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I\nnever thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't\nmatter....\"\n  \n \n  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper.\n\"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and\nhysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish\nI were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that?\nI really love you, after all. After all....\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest\nmountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and\nwarm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What\nare you doing\u2014reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was\nthat, Bruce\u2014that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last\nnight before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\"\n  \n<doc-sep>It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ... THE END\n  \n \n"

        "\n  Mr. Dawes\n  came home an\nhour later, looking tired.\nMom pecked him lightly on\nthe forehead. He glanced at\nthe evening paper, and then\nspoke to Sol.\n  \n \n  \"Hear you been asking\nquestions, Mr. Becker.\"\n  \n \n  Sol nodded, embarrassed.\n\"Guess I have. I'm awfully\ncurious about this Armagon\nplace. Never heard of anything\nlike it before.\"\n  \n \n  Dawes grunted. \"You ain't\na reporter?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I'm an engineer. I\nwas just satisfying my own\ncuriosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh-huh.\" Dawes looked\nreflective. \"You wouldn't be\nthinkin' about writing us up\nor anything. I mean, this is a\npretty private affair.\"\n  \n \n  \"Writing it up?\" Sol\nblinked. \"I hadn't thought of\nit. But you'll have to admit\u2014it's\nsure interesting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" Dawes said narrowly.\n\"I guess it would be.\"\n  \n \n  \"Supper!\" Mom called.\n  \n \n  After the meal, they spent\na quiet evening at home. Sally\nwent to bed, screaming her\nreluctance, at eight-thirty.\nMom, dozing in the big chair\nnear the fireplace, padded upstairs\nat nine. Then Dawes\nyawned widely, stood up, and\nsaid goodnight at quarter-of-ten.\n  \n \n  He paused in the doorway\nbefore leaving.\n  \n \n  \"I'd think about that,\" he\nsaid. \"Writing it up, I mean.\nA lot of folks would think\nyou were just plum crazy.\"\n  \n \n  Sol laughed feebly. \"I\nguess they would at that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Goodnight,\" Dawes said.\n  \n \n  \"Goodnight.\"\n  \n \n  He read Sally's copy of\n   \n   Treasure Island\n   \n  for about\nhalf an hour. Then he undressed,\nmade himself comfortable\non the sofa, snuggled\nunder the soft blanket\nthat Mom had provided, and\nshut his eyes.\n  \n \n  He reviewed the events of\nthe day before dropping off\nto sleep. The troublesome\nSally. The strange dream\nworld of Armagon. The visit\nto the barber shop. The removal\nof Brundage's body.\nThe conversations with the\ntownspeople. Dawes' suspicious\nattitude ...\n  \n \n  Then sleep came.\n <doc-sep>\n  They\n  crossed the\nstreet diagonally, and entered\na two-story wooden building.\nDawes took the stairs at a\nbrisk pace, and pushed open\nthe door on the second floor.\nA fat man looked up from\nbehind a desk.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Charlie. Thought I'd\nsee if you wanted to help\nmove Brundage.\"\n  \n \n  The man batted his eyes.\n\"Oh, Brundage!\" he said.\n\"You know, I clean forgot\nabout him?\" He laughed.\n\"Imagine me forgetting\nthat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah.\" Dawes wasn't\namused. \"And you Prince Regent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aw, Willie\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, come on. Stir that\nfat carcass. Gotta pick up\nSheriff Coogan, too. This\nhere gentleman has to see him\nabout somethin' else.\"\n  \n \n  The man regarded Sol suspiciously.\n\"Never seen you\nbefore. Night\n   \n   or\n   \n  day. Stranger?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come\n   \n   on\n   \n  !\" Dawes said.\n  \n \n  The fat man grunted and\nhoisted himself out of the\nswivel chair. He followed\nlamely behind the two men\nas they went out into the\nstreet again.\n  \n \n  A woman, with an empty\nmarket basket, nodded casually\nto them. \"Mornin', folks.\nEnjoyed it last night.\nThought you made a right\nnice speech, Mr. Dawes.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Dawes answered\ngruffly, but obviously flattered.\n\"We were just goin'\nover to Brundage's to pick up\nthe body. Ma's gonna pay a\ncall on Mrs. Brundage around\nten o'clock. You care to visit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, I think that's very\nnice,\" the woman said. \"I'll\nbe sure and do that.\" She\nsmiled at the fat man. \"Mornin',\nPrince.\"\n  \n \n  Sol's head was spinning. As\nthey left the woman and continued\ntheir determined\nmarch down the quiet street,\nhe tried to find answers.\n  \n \n  \"Look, Mr. Dawes.\" He was\npanting; the pace was fast.\n\"Does\n   \n   she\n   \n  dream about this\u2014Armagon,\ntoo? That woman\nback there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep.\"\n  \n \n  Charlie chuckled. \"He's a\nstranger, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you, Mr.\u2014\" Sol\nturned to the fat man. \"You\nalso know about this palace\nand everything?\"\n  \n \n  \"I told you,\" Dawes said\ntestily. \"Charlie here's Prince\nRegent. But don't let the fancy\ntitle fool you. He got no\nmore power than any Knight\nof the Realm. He's just too\ndern fat to do much more'n\nsit on a throne and eat grapes.\nThat right, Charlie?\"\n  \n \n  The fat man giggled.\n  \n \n  \"Here's the Sheriff,\" Dawes\nsaid.\n  \n \n  The Sheriff, a sleepy-eyed\ncitizen with a long, sad face,\nwas rocking on a porch as\nthey approached his house,\ntrying to puff a half-lit pipe.\nHe lifted one hand wearily\nwhen he saw them.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, Cookie,\" Dawes\ngrinned. \"Thought you, me,\nand Charlie would get Brundage's\nbody outa the house.\nThis here's Mr. Becker; he\ngot another problem. Mr.\nBecker, meet Cookie Coogan.\"\n  \n \n  The Sheriff joined the procession,\npausing only once to\ninquire into Sol's predicament.\n  \n \n  He described the hitchhiker\nincident, but Coogan\nlistened stoically. He murmured\nsomething about the\nTroopers, and shuffled alongside\nthe puffing fat man.\n  \n \n  Sol soon realized that their\ndestination was a barber shop.\n  \n \n  Dawes cupped his hands\nover the plate glass and\npeered inside. Gold letters on\nthe glass advertised: HAIRCUT\nSHAVE & MASSAGE\nPARLOR. He reported: \"Nobody\nin the shop. Must be\nupstairs.\"\n <doc-sep>\n  He\n  was flanked by marble\npillars, thrusting towards\na high-domed ceiling.\n  \n \n  The room stretched long\nand wide before him, the\nwalls bedecked in stunning\npurple draperies.\n  \n \n  He whirled at the sound of\nfootsteps, echoing stridently\non the stone floor. Someone\nwas running towards him.\n  \n \n  It was Sally, pigtails\nstreaming out behind her, the\nsmall body wearing a flowing\nwhite toga. She was shrieking,\nlaughing as she skittered\npast him, clutching a gleaming\ngold helmet.\n  \n \n  He called out to her, but\nshe was too busy outdistancing\nher pursuer. It was Sheriff\nCoogan, puffing and huffing,\nthe metal-and-gold cloth\nuniform ludicrous on his\nlanky frame.\n  \n \n  \"Consarn kid!\" he wheezed.\n\"Gimme my hat!\"\n  \n \n  Mom was following him,\nher stout body regal in scarlet\nrobes. \"Sally! You give\nSir Coogan his helmet! You\nhear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mrs. Dawes!\" Sol said.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Mr. Becker! How\nnice to see you again!

        "\n  The\n  fat man rang the\nbell. It was a while before an\nanswer came.\n  \n \n  It was a reedy woman in a\nhousecoat, her hair in curlers,\nher eyes red and swollen.\n  \n \n  \"Now, now,\" Dawes said\ngently. \"Don't you take on\nlike that, Mrs. Brundage. You\nheard the charges. It hadda\nbe this way.\"\n  \n \n  \"My poor Vincent,\" she\nsobbed.\n  \n \n  \"Better let us up,\" the\nSheriff said kindly. \"No use\njust lettin' him lay there,\nMrs. Brundage.\"\n  \n \n  \"He didn't mean no harm,\"\nthe woman snuffled. \"He was\njust purely ornery, Vincent\nwas. Just plain mean stubborn.\"\n  \n \n  \"The law's the law,\" the\nfat man sighed.\n  \n \n  Sol couldn't hold himself\nin.\n  \n \n  \"What law? Who's dead?\nHow did it happen?\"\n  \n \n  Dawes looked at him disgustedly.\n\"Now is it any of\n   \n   your\n   \n  business? I mean, is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" Sol said\nmiserably.\n  \n \n  \"You better stay out of\nthis,\" the Sheriff warned.\n\"This is a local matter, young\nman. You better stay in the\nshop while we go up.\"\n  \n \n  They filed past him and the\ncrying Mrs. Brundage.\n  \n \n  When they were out of\nsight, Sol pleaded with her.\n  \n \n  \"What happened? How did\nyour husband die?\"\n  \n \n  \"Please ...\"\n  \n \n  \"You must tell me! Was it\nsomething to do with Armagon?\nDo you dream about the\nplace, too?\"\n  \n \n  She was shocked at the\nquestion. \"Of course!\"\n  \n \n  \"And your husband? Did\nhe have the same dream?\"\n  \n \n  Fresh tears resulted. \"Can't\nyou leave me alone?\" She\nturned her back. \"I got things\nto do. You can make yourself\ncomfortable\u2014\" She indicated\nthe barber chairs, and left\nthrough the back door.\n  \n \n  Sol looked after her, and\nthen ambled over to the first\nchair and slipped into the\nhigh seat. His reflection in\nthe mirror, strangely gray in\nthe dim light, made him\ngroan. His clothes were a\nmess, and he needed a shave.\nIf only Brundage had been\nalive ...\n  \n \n  He leaped out of the chair\nas voices sounded behind the\ndoor. Dawes was kicking it\nopen with his foot, his arms\nladen with two rather large\nfeet, still encased in bedroom\nslippers. Charlie was at the\nother end of the burden,\nwhich appeared to be a middle-aged\nman in pajamas. The\nSheriff followed the trio up\nwith a sad, undertaker expression.\nBehind him came Mrs.\nBrundage, properly weeping.\n  \n \n  \"We'll take him to the funeral\nparlor,\" Dawes said,\nbreathing hard. \"Weighs a\nton, don't he?\"\n  \n \n  \"What killed him?\" Sol\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"Heart attack.\"\n  \n \n  The fat man chuckled.\n  \n \n  The tableau was grisly. Sol\nlooked away, towards the\ncomfortingly mundane atmosphere\nof the barber shop. But\neven the sight of the thick-padded\nchairs, the shaving\nmugs on the wall, the neat\nrows of cutting instruments,\nseemed grotesque and morbid.\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" Sol said, as they\nwent through the doorway.\n\"About my car\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The Sheriff turned and regarded\nhim lugubriously.\n\"Your\n   \n   car\n   \n  ? Young man, ain't\nyou got no\n   \n   respect\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Sol swallowed hard and fell\nsilent. He went outside with\nthem, the woman slamming\nthe barber-shop door behind\nhim. He waited in front of\nthe building while the men\ntoted away the corpse to some\nnew destination.\n <doc-sep>Terrence said, \"why did you shoot Doran?\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing me, and\nwhen he shot the\u2014\" Bruce hesitated.\n  \n \n  \"What? When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The problem of where to put the line between dream and reality began to\nworry Bruce. He would wake up and listen and take down what Terrence\nwas saying, and then go to sleep again with increasing expectancy. His\ndream took on continuity. He could return to the point where he had\nleft it, and it was the same\u2014allowing even for the time difference\nnecessitated by his periods of sleep.\n  \n \n  He met people in the dreams, two girls and a man. They had names:\nPietro, Marlene, Helene.\n  \n \n  Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to\nhim all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could\nalso talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense.\nConsistently, they made sense.\n  \n \n  The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green\nvalleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing\ntheir branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there\nwere pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them\nthat were alive and intelligent and soft and warm and wonderful to know.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   ... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting,\nshadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the\ndelirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love\u2014and all our\nown!\u2014than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known....\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the\ndreams.\n  \n \n  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would\nlook out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing\nbut seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.\n  \n \n  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again.\nThe dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"\n  \n \n  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he\ncouldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would\ndie. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into\nhimself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one\ncompensation\u2014he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them\nwho had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way\nacross the Cosmos.\n  \n \n  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him\nmuch more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He\ncould switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure\nto be five hundred thousand feet! It\n   \n   is\n   \n  impossible. We keep climbing\nand now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is\ngoing up and up\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the\nmatter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps\nlaughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it.\nWomen don't have real guts.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled\nsoftly at the door.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember\nhow you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I\nnever thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't\nmatter....\"\n  \n \n  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper.\n\"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and\nhysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish\nI were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that?\nI really love you, after all. After all....\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest\nmountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and\nwarm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What\nare you doing\u2014reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was\nthat, Bruce\u2014that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last\nnight before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\"\n  \n"

Mom was\nbusy at the stove. He said:\n\"Good morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Breakfast in ten minutes,\"\nshe said cheerfully. \"You like\npoached eggs?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. Do you have a telephone?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the hallway.

When Sol hung\nup, he was feeling more despondent\nthan ever.\n  \n \n  A man, tall and rangy, with\na bobbing Adam's apple and\na lined face, came into the\nhallway. \"Hullo?\" he said inquiringly.\n\"You the fella had\nthe car stolen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  The man scratched his ear.\n\"Take you over to Sheriff\nCoogan after breakfast.

She\nwore a fussy, old-fashioned\nnightgown, and was busily\nclutching a worn house-robe\naround her expansive middle.\nShe blinked at Sol Becker's\nrain-flattened hair and hang-dog\nexpression, and said:\n\"What is it? What do you\nwant?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry\u2014\" Sol's voice\nwas pained. \"The man in the\ndiner said you might put me\nup.

You're soaking!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Sol said gratefully.\n  \n \n  With the door firmly shut\nbehind him, the warm interior\nof the little house covered\nhim like a blanket.

        " \n   Henry Slesar, young New York advertising executive and by now no\nlonger a new-comer to either this magazine or to this field, describes\na strange little town that you, yourself, may blunder into one of these\nevenings. But, if you do, beware\u2014beware of the Knights!\n   \n \n \n \n   dream\n    \n   town\n   \n \n \n \n   by ... HENRY SLESAR\n   \n \n \n \n   The woman in the doorway looked so harmless. Who\nwas to tell she had some rather startling interests?\n   \n \n \n  The\n  woman in the\ndoorway looked like Mom in\nthe homier political cartoons.\nShe was plump, apple-cheeked,\nwhite-haired. She\nwore a fussy, old-fashioned\nnightgown, and was busily\nclutching a worn house-robe\naround her expansive middle.\nShe blinked at Sol Becker's\nrain-flattened hair and hang-dog\nexpression, and said:\n\"What is it? What do you\nwant?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry\u2014\" Sol's voice\nwas pained. \"The man in the\ndiner said you might put me\nup. I had my car stolen: a\nhitchhiker; going to Salinas ...\"\nHe was puffing.\n  \n \n  \"Hitchhiker? I don't understand.\"\nShe clucked at the\nsight of the pool of water he\nwas creating in her foyer.\n\"Well, come inside, for heaven's\nsake. You're soaking!\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks,\" Sol said gratefully.\n  \n \n  With the door firmly shut\nbehind him, the warm interior\nof the little house covered\nhim like a blanket. He\nshivered, and let the warmth\nseep over him. \"I'm terribly\nsorry. I know how late it is.\"\nHe looked at his watch, but\nthe face was too misty to\nmake out the hour.\n  \n \n  \"Must be nearly three,\" the\nwoman sniffed. \"You couldn't\nhave come at a worse time. I\nwas just on my way to\ncourt\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The words slid by him. \"If\nI could just stay overnight.\nUntil the morning. I could\ncall some friends in San Fernando.\nI'm very susceptible to\nhead colds,\" he added inanely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, take those shoes off,\nfirst,\" the woman grumbled.\n\"You can undress in the parlor,\nif you'll keep off the rug.\nYou won't mind using the\nsofa?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, of course not. I'd be\nhappy to pay\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, tush, nobody's asking\nyou to pay. This isn't a hotel.\nYou mind if I go back upstairs?\nThey're gonna miss\nme at the palace.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, of course not,\" Sol\nsaid. He followed her into\nthe darkened parlor, and\nwatched as she turned the\nscrew on a hurricane-style\nlamp, shedding a yellow pool\nof light over half a flowery\nsofa and a doily-covered wing\nchair. \"You go on up. I'll be\nperfectly fine.\"\n  \n \n  \"Guess you can use a towel,\nthough. I'll get you one,\nthen I'm going up. We wake\npretty early in this house.\nBreakfast's at seven; you'll\nhave to be up if you want\nany.\"\n  \n \n  \"I really can't thank you\nenough\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Tush,\" the woman said.\nShe scurried out, and returned\na moment later with a\nthick bath towel. \"Sorry I\ncan't give you any bedding.\nBut you'll find it nice and\nwarm in here.\" She squinted\nat the dim face of a ship's-wheel\nclock on the mantle,\nand made a noise with her\ntongue. \"Three-thirty!\" she\nexclaimed. \"I'll miss the\nwhole execution ...\"\n  \n \n  \"The what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Goodnight, young man,\"\nMom said firmly.\n  \n \n  She padded off, leaving Sol\nholding the towel. He patted\nhis face, and then scrubbed\nthe wet tangle of brown hair.\nCarefully, he stepped off the\ncarpet and onto the stone\nfloor in front of the fireplace.\nHe removed his\ndrenched coat and suit jacket,\nand squeezed water out\nover the ashes.\n  \n \n  He stripped down to his\nunderwear, wondering about\nnext morning's possible embarrassment,\nand decided to\nuse the damp bath towel as a\nblanket. The sofa was downy\nand comfortable. He curled\nup under the towel, shivered\nonce, and closed his eyes.\n <doc-sep>\n  He\n  was flanked by marble\npillars, thrusting towards\na high-domed ceiling.\n  \n \n  The room stretched long\nand wide before him, the\nwalls bedecked in stunning\npurple draperies.\n  \n \n  He whirled at the sound of\nfootsteps, echoing stridently\non the stone floor. Someone\nwas running towards him.\n  \n \n  It was Sally, pigtails\nstreaming out behind her, the\nsmall body wearing a flowing\nwhite toga. She was shrieking,\nlaughing as she skittered\npast him, clutching a gleaming\ngold helmet.\n  \n \n  He called out to her, but\nshe was too busy outdistancing\nher pursuer. It was Sheriff\nCoogan, puffing and huffing,\nthe metal-and-gold cloth\nuniform ludicrous on his\nlanky frame.\n  \n \n  \"Consarn kid!\" he wheezed.\n\"Gimme my hat!\"\n  \n \n  Mom was following him,\nher stout body regal in scarlet\nrobes. \"Sally! You give\nSir Coogan his helmet! You\nhear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mrs. Dawes!\" Sol said.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Mr. Becker! How\nnice to see you again! Pa!\n   \n   Pa!\n   \n  Look who's here!\"\n  \n \n  Willie Dawes appeared.\n   \n   No!\n   \n  Sol thought. This was\n   \n   King\n   \n  Dawes; nothing else\ncould explain the magnificence\nof his attire.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Dawes said craftily.\n\"So I see. Welcome to Armagon,\nMr. Becker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Armagon?\" Sol gaped.\n\"Then this is the place\nyou've been dreaming about?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep,\" the King said. \"And\nnow\n   \n   you're\n   \n  in it, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I'm only dreaming!\"\n  \n \n  Charlie, the fat man,\nclumsy as ever in his robes of\nState, said: \"So\n   \n   that's\n   \n  the\nsnooper, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep,\" Dawes chuckled.\n\"Think you better round up\nthe Knights.\"\n  \n \n  Sol said: \"The Knights?\"\n  \n \n  \"Exelution!

Sol backed up against\na pillar. \"Now look here.\nYou've gone far enough\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Not quite,\" said the King.\n  \n \n  The Knights stepped forward.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" Sol screamed.\n  \n \n  Familiar faces, under shining\nhelmets, moved towards\nhim; the tips of sharp-pointed\nspears gleaming wickedly.\nAnd Sol Becker wondered\u2014would\nhe ever awake?\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Fantastic Universe\n  \n January 1957.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

I'd spent eight years trying to keep\nMarge happy, which was exactly seven and a half years too long.\n  \n \n  Marge was a dream to look at, with her tawny hair and her sulky eyes\nand a shape that could set your teeth chattering\u2014but that was where\nthe dream stopped.\n  \n \n  She had a tongue like a #10 wood rasp and a list of grievances long\nenough to paper the bedroom wall. When she wasn't complaining, she was\ncrying, and when she wasn't crying, she was pointing out in chilling\ndetail exactly where George Faircloth fell short as a model husband,\nwhich happened to be everywhere. Half of the time she had a \"beastly\nheadache\" (for which I was personally responsible) and the other half\nshe was sore about something, so ninety-nine per cent of the time we\ngot along like a couple of tomcats in a packing case.\n  \n<doc-sep>Needless to say, the affairs of George Faircloth took on a new sparkle\nwith George Prime on hand to cover the home front.\n  \n \n  For the first week, I was hardly home at all. I must say I felt a\nlittle guilty, leaving poor old George Prime to cope with Marge all\nthe time\u2014he looked and acted so human, it was easy to forget that\nhe literally couldn't care less. But I felt apologetic all the same\nwhenever I took him out of his closet.\n  \n \n  \"She's really a sweet girl underneath it all,\" I'd say. \"You'll learn\nto like her after a bit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I like her,\" George Prime said. \"You told me to, didn't you?\nStop worrying. She's really a sweet girl underneath it all.\"\n  \n \n  He sounded convincing enough, but still it bothered me. \"You're sure\nyou understand the exchange mechanism?\" I asked. I didn't want any\nfoul-ups there, as you can imagine.\n  \n \n  \"Perfectly,\" said George Prime. \"When you buzz the recall, I wait for\nthe first logical opportunity I can find to come out to the workshop,\nand you take over.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you might get nervous. You might inadvertently tip her off.\"\n  \n \n  George Prime looked pained. \"Really, old man! I'm a Super Deluxe model,\nremember? I don't have fourteen activated Hunyadi tubes up in this\ncranial vault of mine just for nothing. You're the one that's nervous.\nI'll take care of everything. Relax.\"\n  \n \n  So I did.\n  \n \n  Jeree made good all her tacit promises and then some. She had a very\ncozy little apartment on 34th Street where we went to relax after\na hard day at the office. When we weren't doing the town, that is.\nAs long as Jeree didn't try too much conversation, everything was\nwonderful.\n  \n \n  And then, when Jeree got a little boring, there was Sybil in the\naccounting department. Or Dorothy in promotion. Or Jane. Or Ingrid.\n  \n \n  I could go on at some length, but I won't. I was building quite a\nreputation for myself around the office.\n  \n \n  Of course, it was like buying your first 3-V set. In a week or so, the\nnovelty wears off a little and you start eating on schedule again. It\ntook a little while, but I finally had things down to a reasonable\nprogram.\n  \n \n  Tuesday and Thursday nights, I was informally \"out\" while formally\n\"in.\" Sometimes I took Sunday nights \"out\" if things got too sticky\naround the house over the weekend. The rest of the time, George Prime\ncooled his heels in his closet. Locked up, of course. Can't completely\ntrust a wife to observe a taboo, no matter how well trained she is.\n  \n \n  There, was an irreconcilable amount of risk. George Prime had to\nquick-step some questions about my work at the office\u2014there was no\nway to supply him with current data until the time for his regular\ntwo-month refill and pattern-accommodation at the laboratory. In the\nmeantime, George Prime had to make do with what he had.\n  \n \n  But as he himself pointed out he was a Super Deluxe model.\n  \n<doc-sep>When I got home, the house was empty. George Prime wasn't in his\ncloset. And Marge wasn't in the house.\n  \n \n  They were gone.\n  \n \n  I started to call the police, but caught myself just in time. I\ncouldn't very well complain to the cops that my wife had run off with\nan android.\n  \n \n  Worse yet, I could get twenty years for having an illegal Prime\nwandering around.\n  \n \n  I sat down and poured myself a stiff drink.\n  \n \n  My own wife deserting me for a pile of bearings.\n  \n \n  It was indecent.\n  \n \n  Then I heard the front door open and there was Marge, her arms full of\ngrocery bundles. \"Why, darling! You're home early!\"\n  \n \n  I just blinked for a moment. Then I said, \"You're still here!\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course. Where did you think I'd be?\"\n  \n \n  \"But I thought\u2014I mean the ticket office\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She set down the bundles and kissed me and looked up into my eyes,\nalmost smiling, half reproachful. \"You didn't really think I'd go\nrunning off with something out of a lab, did you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Then\u2014you knew?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly I knew, silly. You didn't do a very good job of instructing\nhim, either. You gave him far too much latitude. Let him have ideas of\nhis own and all that. And next thing I knew, he was trying to get me to\nrun off with him to Hawaii or someplace.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bermuda,\" I said.\n  \n \n  And then Marge was in my arms, kissing me and snuggling her cheek\nagainst my chest.\n  \n \n  \"Even though he looked like you, I knew he couldn't be,\" she said. \"He\nwas like you, but he wasn't\n   \n   you\n   \n  , darling. And all I ever want is you.\nI just never appreciated you before....\"\n  \n \n  I held her close and tried to keep my hands from shaking. George\nFaircloth, Idiot, I thought. She'd never been more beautiful. \"But what\ndid you do with him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I sent him back to the factory, naturally. They said they could blot\nhim out and use him over again. But let's not talk about that any more.\nWe've got more interesting things to discuss.\"\n  \n \n  Maybe we had, but we didn't waste a lot of time talking. It was the\nMarge I'd once known and I was beginning to wonder how I could have\nbeen so wrong about her. In fact unless my memory was getting awfully\nporous, the old Marge was\n   \n   never\n   \n  like this\u2014\n  \n \n  I kissed her tenderly and ran my hands through her hair, and felt\nthe depression with my fore-finger, and then I knew what had really\nhappened.\n  \n \n  That Marge always had been a sly one.\n  \n \n  I wondered how she was liking things in Bermuda.\n  \n"

I ducked quickly into an alley and flagged him. \"\n   \n   What\nare you doing out on the street?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  He gave me my martyred look. \"Just buying some bourbon. You were out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you're not supposed to be off the premises\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Marge asked me to come.

You don't want her to get\nsuspicious.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, but suppose somebody saw us together! If she ever got a hint\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry,\" George Prime said contritely. \"It seemed the right thing\nto do.\n   \n   You\n   \n  would have done it. At least that's what my judgment\ncenter maintained. We had quite an argument.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, tell your judgment center to use a little sense,\" I snapped. \"I\ndon't want it to happen again.\"\n  \n \n  The next night, I stayed home, even though it was Tuesday night. I was\nbeginning to get worried. Of course, I did have complete control\u2014I\ncould snap George Prime off any time I wanted, or even take him in for\na complete recircuiting\u2014but it seemed a pity. He was doing such a nice\njob.\n  \n \n  Marge was docile as a kitten, even more so than before. She sympathized\nwith my hard day at the office and agreed heartily that the boss,\ndespite all appearances, was in reality a jabbering idiot. After\ndinner, I suggested a movie, but Marge gave me an odd sort of look and\nsaid she thought it would be much nicer to spend the evening at home by\nthe fire.\n  \n \n  I'd just gotten settled with the paper when she came into the living\nroom and sat down beside me. She was wearing some sort of filmy affair\nI'd never laid eyes on before, and I caught a whiff of my favorite\nperfume.\n  \n \n  \"Georgie?\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Uh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you still love me?\"\n  \n \n  I set the paper down and stared at her. \"How's that? Of course I\nstill\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, sometimes you don't act much like it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mm. I guess I've\u2014uh\u2014got an awful headache tonight.\" Damn that\nperfume!\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" said Marge.\n  \n \n  \"In fact, I thought I'd turn in early and get some sleep\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Sleep,\" said Marge. There was no mistaking the disappointment in her\nvoice. Now I knew that things were out of hand.\n  \n \n  The next evening, I activated George Prime and caught the taxi at the\ncorner, but I called Ruby and broke my date with her. I took in an\nearly movie alone and was back by ten o'clock. I left the cab at the\ncorner and walked quietly up the path toward the garage.\n  \n \n  Then I stopped. I could see Marge and George Prime through the living\nroom windows.\n  \n \n  George Prime was kissing my wife the way I hadn't kissed her in eight\nlong years. It made my hair stand on end. And Marge wasn't exactly\nfighting him off, either. She was coming back for more. After a little,\nthe lights went off.\n  \n \n  George Prime was a Super Deluxe model, all right.\n  \n"

But all these checks\nyou've been cashing have emptied the account.\"\n  \n \n  He flashed the checks on the desk screen. My signature was on every one\nof them.\n  \n \n  \"What about my special account?\" I'd learned long before that an\naccount Marge didn't know about was sound rear-guard strategy.\n  \n \n  \"That's been closed out for two weeks.\"\n  \n \n  I hadn't written a check against that account for over a year! I glared\nat the ceiling and tried to think things through.\n  \n \n  I came up with a horrible thought.\n  \n \n  Marge had always had her heart set on a trip to Bermuda. Just to get\naway from it all, she'd say. A second honeymoon.\n  \n \n  I got a list of travel agencies from the business directory and started\ndown them. The third one I tried had a pleasant tenor voice. \"No, sir,\nnot\n   \n   Mrs.\n   \n  Faircloth.\n   \n   You\n   \n  bought two tickets. One way. Champagne\nflight to Bermuda.\"\n  \n \n  \"When?\" I choked out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, today, as a matter of fact.

And poor Marge,\nall worked up for a second honeymoon\u2014\n  \n \n  Then it struck me. Poor Marge? Poor sucker George! No Prime in his\nright circuits would behave this way without some human guidance and\nthat meant only one thing: Marge had spotted him. It had happened\nbefore.

        "It was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding\nin the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling\ngood, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles\nin me. I had my supplies\u2014a few candy bars and some cigarettes\u2014stuffed\nin the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was\nunencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right\nleg and the sling binding my arm.\n  \n \n  I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road,\nstarted limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It\nwas already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes.\nThrough the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various\nwounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking\nabout shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with\nblack hair. \"Want a lift?\" he called.\n  \n \n  I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his\nbudding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow\nhis thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of\ncommunications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.\n  \n \n  An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing\ndistrict of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with\nthe dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.\n  \n \n  Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a\npinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin\ntailor\u2014maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was\nan unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of\ndistinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret.\nThe man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured\nI'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a\nfisherman\u2014I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house\nderelict.\n  \n \n  I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy\nvegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of\nbrontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with\na wart.\n  \n \n  \"How much to the Delta National Laboratories?\"\n  \n \n  He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.\n  \n \n  \"What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm a tourist,\" I said. \"They told me before I left home not to miss\nit.\"\n  \n \n  He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his\nflag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without\nlooking.\n  \n \n  \"How far is it?\" I asked him.\n  \n \n  \"It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pretty big place, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't answer.\n  \n \n  We went through a warehousing district, swung left along the\nwaterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot\ncyclone fence with a locked gate.\n  \n \n  \"A buck ten,\" my driver said.\n  \n \n  I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low\nbuildings. \"What's this?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.\"\n  \n \n  I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew.\nHe blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an\nopen gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me.\n  \n \n  \"You want I should drive in, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll get out here.\"\n  \n \n  He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good\nelbow. \"I'll get your change, sir,\" he said, reaching for his hip.\n  \n \n  \"Keep it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank YOU.\" He hesitated. \"Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope so,\" he said. \"A man like you\u2014you and me\u2014\" he winked. \"After\nall, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.\"\n  \n \n  \"True,\" I said. \"Consider your tip doubled. Now drive away into the\nsunrise and forget you ever saw me.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother\nwhen the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a\ngrowing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very\noff-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh\nfruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat\nand Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n  \n \n  Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have\nbeen pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way\nto handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things\nlike seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell.\nTwice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering\nand I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things\nabout Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n  \n \n  I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the\nnative Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference\nbetween a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the\nslaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging,\nButt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it\nso carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from\nthe tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no\nmatter what, he would never let me hold it.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in\nthe control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look\nat it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the\ngiant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown\nenough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the\ntime to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're\nplain too young to be even near it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even\nhave an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador.\nAll I have is Sis. And\n   \n   she\n   \n  \u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than\nthe Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her\nbreed of green shata.\n   \n   Bossy, opinionated.\n   \n  By the way, Fordie,\" he\nsaid, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off\nhis biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n  \n \n  And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the\nswivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there\nwas a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for\ninstance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd\ntell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than\nthe average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to\nspeak of, back in Undersea, but\u2014yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as\nmuch as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure\npump regulation.\n  \n \n  How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?\n  \n<doc-sep>The early morning sunlight was blinding. Loyce halted, gasping for\nbreath, swaying back and forth. Sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing\nwas torn, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled.\nTen miles\u2014on his hands and knees. Crawling, creeping through the night.\nHis shoes were mud-caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly\nexhausted.\n  \n \n  But ahead of him lay Oak Grove.\n  \n \n  He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and\nfell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything\nreceded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out, away from\nPikeville.\n  \n \n  A farmer in a field gaped at him. From a house a young woman watched in\nwonder. Loyce reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a\ngasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks, some chickens\npecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string.\n  \n \n  The white-clad attendant watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up\nto the station. \"Thank God.\" He caught hold of the wall. \"I didn't think\nI was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear\nthem buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened?\" the attendant demanded. \"You in a wreck? A hold-up?\"\n  \n \n  Loyce shook his head wearily. \"They have the whole town. The City Hall\nand the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. That was the\nfirst thing I saw. They've got all the roads blocked. I saw them\nhovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning I got beyond\nthem. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun\ncame up.\"\n  \n \n  The attendant licked his lip nervously. \"You're out of your head. I\nbetter get a doctor.\"\n  \n \n  \"Get me into Oak Grove,\" Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel.\n\"We've got to get started\u2014cleaning them out. Got to get started right\naway.\"\n  \n"

        "On the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change.\nIt looked the same, but every now and then it\n   \n   felt\n   \n  different.\nOn two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest\nfrom my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch;\nI gunned my motor and nothing happened.\n  \n \n  I could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs,\nthick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as\nthe wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the\nwheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the\ntractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for\nall the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten\nlead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.\n  \n \n  I picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into\nan area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous.\nI caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed\nMcIvers\u2019 scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for\nthe individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn\u2019t\nlike it.\n  \n \n  One error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn\u2019t thinking\nmuch about the others. I was worried about\n   \n   me\n   \n  , plenty\nworried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me.\nIt wasn\u2019t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn\u2019t get the\nthought out of my mind.\n  \n \n  It was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in\nthe Bug again, we moved still more slowly\u2014edging out on a\nbroad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks\u2014winding\nback and forth in an effort to keep the machines on\nsolid rock. I couldn\u2019t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze\nrising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw\na sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond\na deep crack.\n  \n \n  I let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug\nforward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved\nfifty yards to the left, then back to the right.\n  \n \n  There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing;\na long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across\na section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could\nfeel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the\nledge shift over a few feet.\n  \n<doc-sep>Six days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last\noutpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as\nthe eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick\nwater. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray\nsky like puffs of cotton.\n  \n \n  We had traveled this far by\n   \n   ganet\n   \n  , the tough little two headed pack\nanimal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have\nhad its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force\nbelt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to\nboatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy\n   \n   jagua\n   \n  canoes.\n  \n \n  It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her\nconfidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.\n  \n \n  \"We're heading directly for Varsoom country,\" she said. \"If we find\nEzra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to\nthe lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You\nsee, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the\nship.\"\n  \n \n  Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours\ntossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned\nsteadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi\njust before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer\nthat broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an\nisolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had\ngiven me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly\ncoming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that\nrepresentative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held\nto find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.\n  \n \n  Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my\ntent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe\nGrannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots\nwhich she had skilfully blended into a novel?\n  \n \n  Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its\nplace a ringing silence blanketed everything.\n  \n \n  And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in\nundulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched\nit advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.\nIt charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.\nThere was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp\ntalons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,\nmissing the thing by the narrowest of margins.\n  \n \n  From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress\nappeared. Grannie gave a single warning:\n  \n \n  \"Stand still!\"\n  \n \n  The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us\nagain. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of\npurple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the\nair. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the\nground and shot aloft.\n  \n \n \n \n   Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.\n   \n \n \n \n  I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, what was it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hunter-bird,\" Grannie said calmly. \"A form of avian life found here\nin the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be\ntrained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain\nand follows with a relentless purpose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then that would mean...?\"\n  \n \n  \"That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the\ncafe in Swamp City. Exactly.\" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her\ntent and faced me with earnest eyes. \"Billy-boy, our every move is\nbeing watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from\nthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard\nwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky\nof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud\nflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged\nalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.\n  \n \n  From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them\nin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were\na gun and a long knife.\n  \n \n  \"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big\neverywhere in proportion.\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Graybar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,\nyou.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.\n  \n \n  \"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty\nand warden and parole officer rolled into one.\"\n  \n \n  Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his\ndistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown\nhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim\nrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a\nnative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.\n  \n \n  Furston laughed.\n  \n \n  \"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning.\n\"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any\nideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is\nwhere you eat.\"\n  \n \n  Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He\nlifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from\nan observation tower on the roof.\n  \n \n  He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.\n  \n \n  Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session\nwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.\n  \n \n  The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried\nhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent\nposition to make the riddance permanent.\n  \n \n  At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with\nthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the\ntwo were doing out here.\n  \n \n  \"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of\nthe others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel\nhe is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the\noperations.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to\ncarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and\nassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called\nGraybar aside.\n  \n \n  \"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week\nknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there\nand work that muck.\"\n  \n \n  Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could\nshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the\ncourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it\nand hopped along after Kershaw.\n  \n \n  Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the\nHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The\nmud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was\nnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins\nlike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded\nand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced\neye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.\n  \n \n  \"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here\nlately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,\nstart shooting.\"\n  \n \n  At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no\nSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as\nmuch as on top of it.\n  \n \n  Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten\nyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in\nthe muck.\n  \n \n  \"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg\nwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to\nspot when the new weeds start growing.\"\n  \n \n  Kershaw took a long look around.\n  \n \n  \"No trouble in sight. We dig.\"\n  \n \n  They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs\nof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually\na muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw\ndug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had\nto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit\nbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently\nbefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he\nworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything\nabout the operation was wrong.\n  \n \n  \"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping\nslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to\nwatch.\n  \n \n  \"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of\nmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look\nat it.\"\n  \n \n \n  A SLIDER EGG\n  \n \n \n  The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds\nbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's\nearphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the\nscintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider\nfor help. Asa looked around.\n  \n \n  \"Jump!\" he shouted.\n  \n \n  At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black\nscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the\nweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row\nupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered\nits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot\nforward.\n  \n \n  Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.\nWhile he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio\ndown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned\ninstantly, his gun in his hand.\n  \n \n  \"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw\nand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\"\n  \n \n  \"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\"\n  \n \n  \"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\"\n  \n \n  \"On the way.\"\n  \n \n  Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by\nthe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the\nother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where\nKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working\nmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another\ncharge.\n  \n \n  Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The\nrocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray\nflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward\nAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw\nthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs\nwere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the\nSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he\nthrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired\nagain.\n  \n \n \n \n  Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered\nwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.\nDesperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body\nshiver and lie still.\n  \n"

        "The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and\nwhen Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to\nthe village he had visited the day before. However, there were other\nseal-people here.\n  \n \n  And they were almost human!\n  \n \n  The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup\u2014that\nwas little changed from the first he had found\u2014as in their obviously\ngreater intelligence.\n  \n \n  This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.\nKaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he\nslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.\nWhere the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly\nalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these\nhad no odor\u2014only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet\nhim, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.\n  \n \n  Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes\nof curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.\n  \n \n  One was a female.\n  \n \n  They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he\nunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He\ntried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object,\nbut their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused\nhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was\nfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to\ncarry on a limited conversation.\n  \n \n  The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until\nKaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached\nthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked, mother, father and the two children, smelling the smells,\nwatching the birds bounce from wall to wall of the valley like\nscurrying pebbles and suddenly the father said a strange thing:\n  \n \n  \"Remember?\"\n  \n \n  Remember what? Sim lay cradled. Was it any effort for them to remember\nwhen they'd lived only seven days!\n  \n \n  The husband and wife looked at each other.\n  \n \n  \"Was it only three days ago?\" said the woman, her body shaking, her\neyes closing to think. \"I can't believe it. It is so unfair.\" She\nsobbed, then drew her hand across her face and bit her parched lips.\nThe wind played at her gray hair. \"Now is my turn to cry. An hour ago\nit was you!\"\n  \n \n  \"An hour is half a life.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" she took her husband's arm. \"Let us look at everything, because\nit will be our last looking.\"\n  \n \n  \"The sun'll be up in a few minutes,\" said the old man. \"We must turn\nback now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just one more moment,\" pleaded the woman.\n  \n \n  \"The sun will catch us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let it catch me then!\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean nothing, nothing at all,\" cried the woman.\n  \n \n  The sun was coming fast. The green in the valley burnt away. Searing\nwind blasted from over the cliffs. Far away where sun bolts hammered\nbattlements of cliff, the huge stone faces shook their contents; those\navalanches not already powdered down, were now released and fell like\nmantles.\n  \n \n  \"Dark!\" shouted the father. The girl sprang over the warm floor of the\nvalley, answering, her hair a black flag behind her. Hands full of\ngreen fruits, she joined them.\n  \n \n  The sun rimmed the horizon with flame, the air convulsed dangerously\nwith it, and whistled.\n  \n \n  The cave people bolted, shouting, picking up their fallen children,\nbearing vast loads of fruit and grass with them back to their deep\nhideouts. In moments the valley was bare. Except for one small child\nsomeone had forgotten. He was running far out on the flatness, but he\nwas not strong enough, and the engulfing heat was drifting down from\nthe cliffs even as he was half across the valley.\n  \n \n  Flowers were burnt into effigies, grasses sucked back into rocks like\nsinged snakes, flower seeds whirled and fell in the sudden furnace\nblast of wind, sown far into gullies and crannies, ready to blossom at\nsunset tonight, and then go to seed and die again.\n  \n \n  Sim's father watched that child running, alone, out on the floor of\nthe valley. He and his wife and Dark and Sim were safe in the mouth of\ntheir tunnel.\n  \n \n  \"He'll never make it,\" said father. \"Do not watch him, woman. It's not\na good thing to watch.\"\n  \n \n  They turned away. All except Sim, whose eyes had caught a glint of\nmetal far away. His heart hammered in him, and his eyes blurred.\nFar away, atop a low mountain, one of those metal seeds from space\nreflected a dazzling ripple of light! It was like one of his\nintra-embryo dreams fulfilled! A metal space seed, intact, undamaged,\nlying on a mountain! There was his future! There was his hope\nfor survival! There was where he would go in a few days, when he\nwas\u2014strange thought\u2014a grown man!\n  \n \n  The sun plunged into the valley like molten lava.\n  \n \n  The little running child screamed, the sun burned, and the screaming\nstopped.\n  \n \n  Sim's mother walked painfully, with sudden age, down the tunnel,\npaused, reached up, broke off two last icicles that had formed during\nthe night. She handed one to her husband, kept the other. \"We will\ndrink one last toast. To you, to the children.\"\n  \n \n  \"To\n   \n   you\n   \n  ,\" he nodded to her. \"To the children.\" They lifted the\nicicles. The warmth melted the ice down into their thirsty mouths.\n  \n<doc-sep>Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich\u2014whose memory was\ngone completely\u2014again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n  \n"

And now its fuel was low.\n  \n \n  Kaiser had that one month to repair his scout or be stranded here\nforever.\n  \n \n  That was all he could remember. Nothing of what he had been doing\nrecently.\n  \n \n  A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the\ntape in his hand. Baby talk....\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n<doc-sep>Two miles into the dark hills north of the Elsby city limits, Tremaine\nrounded a curve. The police car was parked on the shoulder beside the\nhighway just ahead. He pulled off the road ahead of it and walked back.\nThe door opened. A tall figure stepped out.\n  \n \n  \"What's your problem, mister?\" a harsh voice drawled.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?

Nothing of what he had been doing\nrecently.\n  \n \n  A small shiver passed through his body as he glanced once again at the\ntape in his hand. Baby talk....\n  \n<doc-sep>The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and\nwhen Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to\nthe village he had visited the day before. However, there were other\nseal-people here.\n  \n \n  And they were almost human!\n  \n \n  The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup\u2014that\nwas little changed from the first he had found\u2014as in their obviously\ngreater intelligence.\n  \n \n  This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked.\nKaiser was even certain that he read smiles on their faces when he\nslipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them.\nWhere the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly\nalike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these\nhad no odor\u2014only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet\nhim, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.\n  \n \n  Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes\nof curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.\n  \n \n  One was a female.\n  \n \n  They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he\nunderstood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He\ntried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object,\nbut their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused\nhimself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was\nfairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to\ncarry on a limited conversation.\n  \n \n  The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until\nKaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached\nthe river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.\n  \n<doc-sep>Kaiser came wide awake in a cold sweat. The clock showed that only an\nhour had passed since he had sent his last message to the ship. Still\nfive more long hours to wait. He rose and wiped the sweat from his neck\nand shoulders and restlessly paced the small corridor of the scout.\n  \n \n  After a few minutes, he stopped pacing and peered out into the gloom of\nBig Muddy. The rain seemed to have eased off some. Not much more than a\nheavy drizzle now.\n  \n \n  Kaiser reached impulsively for the slicker he had thrown over a chest\nagainst one wall and put it on, then a pair of hip-high plastic boots\nand a plastic hat. He opened the door. The scout had come to rest with\na slight tilt when it crashed, and Kaiser had to sit down and roll\nover onto his stomach to ease himself to the ground.\n  \n \n  The weather outside was normal for Big Muddy: wet, humid, and warm.\n  \n \n  Kaiser sank to his ankles in soft mud before his feet reached solid\nground. He half walked and half slid to the rear of the scout. Beside\nthe ship, the \"octopus\" was busily at work. Tentacles and antennae,\nextending from the yard-high box of its body, tested and recorded\ntemperature, atmosphere, soil, and all other pertinent planetary\nconditions. The octopus was connected to the ship's communicator and\nall its findings were being transmitted to the mother ship for study.\n  \n \n  Kaiser observed that it was working well and turned toward a wide,\nsluggish river, perhaps two hundred yards from the scout. Once there,\nhe headed upstream. He could hear the pipings, and now and then a\nhigher whistling, of the seal-people before he reached a bend and saw\nthem. As usual, most were swimming in the river.\n  \n \n \n \n  One old fellow, whose chocolate-brown fur showed a heavy intermixture\nof gray, was sitting on the bank of the river just at the bend. Perhaps\na lookout. He pulled himself to his feet as he spied Kaiser and his\ntoothless, hard-gummed mouth opened and emitted a long whistle that\nmight have been a greeting\u2014or a warning to the others that a stranger\napproached.\n  \n \n  The native stood perhaps five feet tall, with the heavy, blubbery\nbody of a seal, and short, thick arms. Membranes connected the arms\nto his body from shoulder-pits to mid-biceps. The arms ended in\nthree-fingered, thumbless hands. His legs also were short and thick,\nwith footpads that splayed out at forty-five-degree angles. They gave\nhis legs the appearance of a split tail. About him hung a rank-fish\nsmell that made Kaiser's stomach squirm.\n  \n \n  The old fellow sounded a cheerful chirp as Kaiser came near. Feeling\nslightly ineffectual, Kaiser raised both hands and held them palm\nforward. The other chirped again and Kaiser went on toward the main\ngroup.\n  \n"

It was the most important problem any\ncountry could have in this time of growing atomic industry. Now a\nsmall-time gangster was asking me to use this research to help him\ndispose of hot corpses.

No one had ever been able to figure out what to do with them.\n  \n \n  I knew the AEC wasn't going to dump tons of radioactive waste (with\nsome possible future reclaimation value) into a machine which they\ndidn't believe actually could work.\n  \n \n  Tony Carmen knew exactly what to do with an Expendable once he got his\nhands on it.\n  \n \n  Naturally, that was what I had been afraid of.\n  \n"

I'll join Andrew, Curt, Norman\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary,\" Fownes said with unusual force. \"With all\ndue respect to Andrew, Curt, Norman and Alphonse, I might as well state\nhere and now I have other plans for you, Mrs. Deshazaway.\"\n  \n \n  \"But my dear Mr. Fownes,\" she said, leaning across the table. \"We're\nlost, you and I.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not if we could leave the dome,\" Fownes said quietly.\n  \n \n  \"That's impossible! How?\"\n  \n \n  In no hurry, now that he had the widow's complete attention, Fownes\nleaned across the table and whispered: \"Fresh air, Mrs. Deshazaway?\nSpace? Miles and miles of space where the real-estate monopoly has\nno control whatever? Where the\n   \n   wind\n   \n  blows across\n   \n   prairies\n   \n  ; or is\nit the other way around? No matter. How would you like\n   \n   that\n   \n  , Mrs.\nDeshazaway?\"\n  \n \n  Breathing somewhat faster than usual, the widow rested her chin on her\ntwo hands. \"Pray continue,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"Endless vistas of moonlight and roses? April showers, Mrs. Deshazaway.\nAnd June, which as you may know follows directly upon April and is\nsupposed to be the month of brides, of marrying. June also lies beyond\nthe dome.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   And\n   \n  ,\" Mr. Fownes added, his voice a honeyed whisper, \"they say\nthat somewhere out in the space and the roses and the moonlight,\nthe sleeping equinox yawns and rises because on a certain day it's\n   \n   vernal\n   \n  and that's when it roams the Open Country where geigers no\nlonger scintillate.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   My.\n   \n  \" Mrs. Deshazaway rose, paced slowly to the window and then came\nback to the table, standing directly over Fownes. \"If you can get us\noutside the dome,\" she said, \"out where a man stays\n   \n   warm\n   \n  long enough\nfor his wife to get to know him ... if you can do that, Mr. Fownes ...\nyou may call me Agnes.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n"

        "\n  MacKENZIE didn't seem to be taking any notes, or paying any special\nattention to the answers Ish was giving to his casual questions. But the\nquestions fell into a pattern that was far from casual, and Ish could\nsee the small button-mike of a portable tape-recorder nestling under the\nman's lapel.\n  \n \n  \"Been working your own way for the last seventeen years, haven't you?\"\nMacKenzie seemed to mumble in a perfectly clear voice.\n  \n \n  Ish nodded.\n  \n \n  \"How's that?\"\n  \n \n  The corners of Isherwood's mouth twitched, and he said \"Yes\" for the\nrecorder's benefit.\n  \n \n  \"Odd jobs, first of all?\"\n  \n \n  \"Something like that. Anything I could get, the first few months. After\nI was halfway set up, I stuck to garages and repair shops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out at the airports around Miami, mostly, wasn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ahuh.\"\n  \n \n  \"Took some of your pay in flying lessons.\"\n  \n \n  \"Right.\"\n  \n \n  MacKenzie's face passed no judgements\u2014he simply hunched in his chair,\nseemingly dwarfed by the shoulders of his perfectly tailored suit, his\nstubby fingers twiddling a Phi Beta Kappa key. He was a spare man\u2014only\na step or two away from emaciation. Occasionally, he pushed a tired\nstrand of washed-out hair away from his forehead.\n  \n \n  Ish answered him truthfully, without more than ordinary reservations.\nThis was the man who could ground him He was dangerous\u2014red-letter\ndangerous\u2014because of it.\n  \n \n  \"No family.\"\n  \n \n  Ish shrugged. \"Not that I know of.

No need to\nworry about them.\"\n  \n \n  Ish knew the normal reaction a statement like that should have brought.\nMacKenzie's face did not go into a blank of repression\u2014but it still\npassed no judgements.\n  \n \n  \"How's things between you and the opposite sex?\"\n  \n \n  \"About normal.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wife\u2014no steady girl.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not a very good idea, in my racket.\"\n  \n \n  MacKenzie grunted. Suddenly, he sat bolt upright in his chair, and swung\ntoward Ish. His lean arm shot out, and his index finger was aimed\nbetween Isherwood's eyes. \"You can't go!\"\n  \n \n  Ish was on his feet, his fists clenched, the blood throbbing in his\ntemple veins. \"What!\" he roared.\n  \n \n  MacKenzie seemed to collapse in his chair. The brief commanding burst\nwas over, and his face was apologetic, \"Sorry,\" he said. He seemed\ngenuinely abashed. \"Shotgun therapy. Works best, sometimes. You can go,\nall right; I just wanted to get a fast check on your reactions and\ndrives.\"\n  \n \n  Ish could feel the anger that still ran through him\u2014anger, and more\nfear than he wanted to admit. \"I'm due at a briefing,\" he said tautly.\n\"You through with me?\"\n  \n \n  MacKenzie nodded, still embarrassed. \"Sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Ish ignored the man's obvious feelings. He stopped at the door to send a\nparting stroke at the thing that had frightened him. \"Big gun in the\npsychiatry racket, huh? Well, your professional lingo's slipping, Doc.\nThey did put\n   \n   some\n   \n  learning in my head at college, you know. Therapy,\nhell! Testing maybe, but you sure didn't do anything to help me!\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" MacKenzie said softly. \"I wish I did.\"\n  \n \n  Ish slammed the door behind him. He stood in the corridor, jamming a\nfresh cigarette in his mouth. He threw a glance at his watch. Twelve\nhours, twenty-two minutes, and four days to go.\n  \n \n  Damn! He was late for the briefing. Odd\u2014that fool psychiatrist hadn't\nseemed to take up that much of his time.\n  \n \n  He shrugged. What difference did it make? As he strode down the hall, he\nlost his momentary puzzlement under the flood of realization that\nnothing could stop him now, that the last hurdle was beaten. He was\ngoing. He was going, and if there were faint echoes of \"Marty!\" ringing\nin the dark background of his mind, they only served to push him faster,\nas they always had. Nothing but death could stop him now.\n  \n \n \n<doc-sep>Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just\ngiving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was\nhe trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right\nthing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all\nright.\n  \n \n  Was Conrad\n   \n   actually\n   \n  different from the rest?\n  \n \n  His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had\nconsisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...\nnothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they\nhad stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?\n  \n \n  \"Why,\" Martin said to himself, \"in a sense, it could be said that I\nhave fulfilled my original destiny\u2014that I am a criminal.\"\n  \n \n  Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to\nblame. He held no stake in the future that was to come. It was other\nmen's future\u2014other men's problem. He died very peacefully then, and,\nsince he was the only one left on the ship, there was nobody to bury\nhim.\n  \n \n  The unmanned yacht drifted about the seas for years and gave rise to\nmany legends, none of them as unbelievable as the truth.\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight.

        "  \"Any problem posed by one group of\nhuman beings can be resolved by any\nother group.\" That's what the Handbook\nsaid. But did that include primitive\nhumans? Or the Bees? Or a ...\n  \n \n  CONTROL GROUP\n  \n \n  By ROGER DEE\n  \n<doc-sep>Dan took a deep breath and tried another lever. The cage rose gently,\nin eerie silence. It reached the ceiling and kept going. Dan gritted\nhis teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage.\nThen he was emerging into a spacious kitchen. A blue-haloed cook\nwaddled to a luminous refrigerator, caught sight of Dan rising slowly\nfrom the floor, stumbled back, mouth open. The cage rose, penetrated a\nsecond ceiling. Dan looked around at a carpeted hall.\n  \n \n  Cautiously he neutralized the control lever. The cage came to rest an\ninch above the floor. As far as Dan could tell, he hadn't traveled so\nmuch as a minute into the past or future.\n  \n \n  He looked over the controls. There should be one labeled \"Forward\"\nand another labeled \"Back\", but all the levers were plain, unadorned\nblack. They looked, Dan decided, like ordinary circuit-breaker type\nknife-switches. In fact, the whole apparatus had the appearance of\nsomething thrown together hastily from common materials. Still, it\nworked. So far he had only found the controls for maneuvering in the\nusual three dimensions, but the time switch was bound to be here\nsomewhere....\n  \n \n  Dan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall.\n  \n \n  A girl's head and shoulders appeared, coming up a spiral staircase. In\nanother second she would see him, and give the alarm\u2014and Dan needed\na few moments of peace and quiet in which to figure out the controls.\nHe moved a lever. The cage drifted smoothly sideways, sliced through\nthe wall with a flurry of vivid blue light. Dan pushed the lever\nback. He was in a bedroom now, a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a\nfour-poster under a flowered canopy, a dressing table\u2014\n  \n \n  The door opened and the girl stepped into the room. She was young. Not\nover eighteen, Dan thought\u2014as nearly as he could tell with the blue\nlight playing around her face. She had long hair tied with a ribbon,\nand long legs, neatly curved. She wore shorts and carried a tennis\nracquet in her left hand and an apple in her right. Her back to Dan and\nthe cage, she tossed the racquet on a table, took a bite of the apple,\nand began briskly unbuttoning her shirt.\n  \n \n  Dan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl. Another;\nhe rose gently. The girl tossed the shirt onto a chair and undid the\nzipper down the side of the shorts. Another lever; the cage shot toward\nthe outer wall as the girl reached behind her back....\n  \n \n  Dan blinked at the flash of blue and looked down. He was hovering\ntwenty feet above a clipped lawn.\n  \n \n  He looked at the levers. Wasn't it the first one in line that moved the\ncage ahead? He tried it, shot forward ten feet. Below, a man stepped\nout on the terrace, lit a cigarette, paused, started to turn his face\nup\u2014\n  \n \n  Dan jabbed at a lever. The cage shot back through the wall. He was in a\nplain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window with a planter\nfilled with glowing blue plants\u2014\n  \n \n  The door opened. Even blue, the girl looked graceful as a deer as she\ntook a last bite of the apple and stepped into the ten-foot-square\nsunken tub. Dan held his breath. The girl tossed the apple core aside,\nseemed to suddenly become aware of eyes on her, whirled\u2014\n  \n \n  With a sudden lurch that threw Dan against the steel bars, the\ncage shot through the wall into the open air and hurtled off with\nan acceleration that kept him pinned, helpless. He groped for the\ncontrols, hauled at a lever. There was no change. The cage rushed\non, rising higher. In the distance, Dan saw the skyline of a town,\napproaching with frightful speed. A tall office building reared up\nfifteen stories high. He was headed dead for it\u2014\n  \n \n  He covered his ears, braced himself\u2014\n  \n \n  With an abruptness that flung him against the opposite side of the\ncage, the machine braked, shot through the wall and slammed to a stop.\nDan sank to the floor of the cage, breathing hard. There was a loud\n   \n   click!\n   \n  and the glow faded.\n  \n \n  With a lunge, Dan scrambled out of the cage. He stood looking around at\na simple brown-painted office, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through\nelaborate venetian blinds. There were posters on the wall, a potted\nplant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and at the far\nside of the room a desk. And behind the desk\u2014Something.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Dan gaped at a head the size of a beachball, mounted on a torso like a\nhundred-gallon bag of water. Two large brown eyes blinked at him from\npoints eight inches apart. Immense hands with too many fingers unfolded\nand reached to open a brown paper carton, dip in, then toss three\npeanuts, deliberately, one by one, into a gaping mouth that opened just\nabove the brown eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Who're you?\" a bass voice demanded from somewhere near the floor.\n  \n \n  \"I'm ... I'm ... Dan Slane ... your honor.\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to Manny and Fiorello?\"\n  \n \n  \"They\u2014I\u2014There was this cop. Kelly\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh-oh.\" The brown eyes blinked deliberately. The many-fingered hands\nclosed the peanut carton and tucked it into a drawer.\n  \n \n  \"Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted,\" the basso voice said. \"A\npity to terminate so happy an enterprise. Still....\" A noise like an\namplified Bronx cheer issued from the wide mouth.\n  \n \n  \"How ... what...?\"\n  \n \n  \"The carrier returns here automatically when the charge drops below a\ncritical value,\" the voice said. \"A necessary measure to discourage\nbig ideas on the part of wisenheimers in my employ. May I ask how you\nhappen to be aboard the carrier, by the way?\"\n  \n \n  \"I just wanted\u2014I mean, after I figured out\u2014that is, the police ... I\nwent for help,\" Dan finished lamely.\n  \n \n  \"Help? Out of the picture, unfortunately. One must maintain one's\nanonymity, you'll appreciate. My operation here is under wraps at\npresent. Ah, I don't suppose you brought any paintings?\"\n  \n \n  Dan shook his head. He was staring at the posters. His eyes,\naccustoming themselves to the gloom of the office, could now make out\nthe vividly drawn outline of a creature resembling an alligator-headed\ngiraffe rearing up above scarlet foliage. The next poster showed a face\nsimilar to the beachball behind the desk, with red circles painted\naround the eyes. The next was a view of a yellow volcano spouting fire\ninto a black sky.\n  \n \n  \"Too bad.\" The words seemed to come from under the desk. Dan squinted,\ncaught a glimpse of coiled purplish tentacles. He gulped and looked up\nto catch a brown eye upon him. Only one. The other seemed to be busily\nat work studying the ceiling.\n  \n \n  \"I hope,\" the voice said, \"that you ain't harboring no reactionary\nracial prejudices.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Again they sat in the thick chairs before the wall of desks with the\nfaces of the council looking across it like defenders.\n  \n \n  The pumps were beating, beating all through the room and the quiet.\n  \n \n  The President was standing. He faced Michael and Mary, and seemed to\nset himself as though to deliver a blow, or to receive one.\n  \n \n  \"Michael and Mary,\" he said, his voice struggling against a tightness,\n\"we've considered a long time concerning what is to be done with you\nand the report you brought back to us from the galaxy.\" He took\nanother swallow of water. \"To protect the sanity of the people, we've\nchanged your report. We've also decided that the people must be\nprotected from the possibility of your spreading the truth, as you did\nat the landing field. So, for the good of the people, you'll be\nisolated. All comforts will be given you. After all, in a sense, you\n   \n   are\n   \n  heroes and martyrs. Your scar tissue will be cultured as it has\nbeen in the past, and you will stay in solitary confinement until the\ntime when, perhaps, we can migrate to another planet. We feel that\nhope must not be destroyed. And so another expedition is being sent\nout. It may be that, in time, on another planet, you'll be able to\ntake your place in our society.\"\n  \n \n  He paused. \"Is there anything you wish to say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Proceed.\"\n  \n \n  Michael stared straight at the President. After a long moment, he\nraised his hand to the tiny locket at his throat.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you remember,\" he said, \"the lockets given to every member of\nthe expedition the night before we left. I still have mine.\" He raised\nit. \"So does my wife. They were designed to kill the wearer instantly\nand painlessly if he were ever faced with pain or a terror he couldn't\nendure.\"\n  \n \n  The President was standing again. A stir ran along the barricade of\ndesks.\n  \n \n  \"We can't endure the city,\" went on Michael, \"or its life and the ways\nof the people.\" He glanced along the line of staring faces.\n  \n \n  \"If what I think you're about to say is true,\" said the President in a\nshaking voice, \"it would have been better if you'd never been born.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's face facts, Mr. President. We were\n   \n   born\n   \n  and haven't\ndied\u2014yet.\" A pause. \"And we can kill ourselves right here before your\neyes. It'd be painless to us. We'd be unconscious. But there would be\nhorrible convulsions and grimaces. Our bodies would be twisted and\ntorn. They'd thresh about. The deaths you saw in the picture happened\na long time ago, in outer space. You all went into hysterics at the\nsight of them. Our deaths now would be close and terrible to see.\"\n  \n \n  The President staggered as though about to faint. There was a stirring\nand muttering and a jumping up along the desks. Voices cried out, in\nanger and fear. Arms waved and fists pounded. Hands clasped and\nunclasped and clawed at collars, and there was a pell mell rushing\naround the President. They yelled at each other and clasped each other\nby the shoulders, turned away and back again, and then suddenly became\nvery still.\n  \n \n  Now they began to step down from the raised line of desks, the\nPresident leading them, and came close to the man and woman, gathering\naround them in a wide half circle.\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary were holding the lockets close to their throats. The\nhalf circle of people, with the President at its center was moving\ncloser and closer. They were sweaty faces and red ones and dry white\nones and hands were raised to seize them.\n  \n \n  Michael put his arm around Mary's waist. He felt the trembling in her\nbody and the waiting for death.\n  \n \n  \"Stop!\" he said quietly.\n  \n \n  They halted, in slight confusion, barely drawing back.\n  \n \n  \"If you want to see us die\u2014just come a step closer.... And remember\nwhat'll happen to you.\"\n  \n \n  The faces began turning to each other and there was an undertone of\nmuttering and whispering. \"A ghastly thing.... Instant.... Nothing to\ndo.... Space's broken their minds.... They'll do it.... Eyes're\nmad.... What can we do?... What?...\" The sweaty faces, the cold white\nones, the flushed hot ones: all began to turn to the President, who\nwas staring at the two before him like a man watching himself die in a\nmirror.\n  \n \n  \"I command you,\" he suddenly said, in a choked voice, \"to\u2014to give me\nthose\u2014lockets! It's your\u2014duty!\"\n  \n \n  \"We've only one duty, Mr. President,\" said Michael sharply. \"To\nourselves.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're sick. Give yourselves over to us. We'll help you.\"\n  \n \n  \"We've made our choice. We want an answer. Quickly! Now!\"\n  \n \n  The President's body sagged. \"What\u2014what is it you want?\"\n  \n \n  Michael threw the words. \"To go beyond the force fields of the city.\nTo go far out onto the Earth and live as long as we can, and then to\ndie a natural death.\"\n  \n \n  The half circle of faces turned to each other and muttered and\nwhispered again. \"In the name of God.... Let them go.... Contaminate\nus.... Like animals.... Get them out of here....\n   \n   Let\n   \n  them be\nfinished.... Best for us all.... And them....\"\n  \n \n  There was a turning to the President again and hands thrusting him\nforward to within one step of Michael and Mary, who were standing\nthere close together, as though attached.\n  \n \n  Haltingly he said, \"Go. Please go. Out onto the Earth\u2014to die. You\n   \n   will\n   \n  die. The Earth is dead out there. You'll never see the city or\nyour people again.\"\n  \n \n  \"We want a ground car,\" said Michael. \"And supplies.\"\n  \n \n  \"A ground car,\" repeated the President. \"And\u2014supplies.... Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can give us an escort, if you want to, out beyond the first range\nof mountains.\"\n  \n \n  \"There will be no escort,\" said the President firmly. \"No one has been\nallowed to go out upon the Earth or to fly above it for many hundreds\nof years. We know it's there. That's enough. We couldn't bear the\nsight of it.\" He took a step back. \"And we can't bear the sight of you\nany longer. Go now. Quickly!\"\n  \n \n  Michael and Mary did not let go of the lockets as they watched the\nhalf circle of faces move backward, staring, as though at corpses that\nshould sink to the floor.\n  \n"

        "\n  The\n  cool green disk of Alphard\nSix on the screen was\ninfinitely welcome after the arid\ndesolation and stinking swamplands\nof the inner planets, an\nairy jewel of a world that might\nhave been designed specifically\nfor the hard-earned month of\nrest ahead. Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come.",
        " So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

        "Kaiser could imagine that most of the crew were not too concerned about\nthe trouble he was in. He was not the gregarious type and had no close\nfriends on board. He had hoped to find the solitude he liked best in\nspace, but he had been disappointed. True, there were fewer people\nhere, but he was brought into such intimate contact with them that he\nwould have been more contented living in a crowded city.\n  \n \n  His naturally unsociable nature was more irksome to the crew because\nhe was more intelligent and efficient than they were. He did his work\nwell and painstakingly and was seldom in error. They would have liked\nhim better had he been more prone to mistakes. He was certain that they\nrespected him, but they did not like him. And he returned the dislike.\n  \n \n  The suggestion that he get some sleep might not be a bad idea. He\nhadn't slept in over eighteen hours, Kaiser realized\u2014and fell\ninstantly asleep.\n  \n \n  The communicator had a message waiting for him when he awoke:\n  \n \n  SAM COULDN'T HELP US MUCH ON THIS PART, BUT AFTER RESEARCH AND MUCH\nDISCUSSION, WE ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING TWO CONCLUSIONS.\n  \n \n  FIRST, PHYSICAL PROPERTY OF SYMBIOTE IS EITHER THAT OF A VERY THIN\nLIQUID OR, MORE PROBABLY, A VIRUS FORM WITH SWIFT PROPAGATION\nCHARACTERISTIC. IT UNDOUBTEDLY LIVES IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND\nPERMEATES YOUR SYSTEM.\n  \n \n  SECOND, IT SEEMED TO US, AS IT MUST HAVE TO YOU, THAT THE SYMBIOTE\nCOULD ONLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED BY READING YOUR MIND. HOWEVER, WE\nBELIEVE DIFFERENTLY NOW. WE THINK THAT IT HAS SUCH CLOSE CONTACT WITH\nYOUR GLANDS AND THEIR SECRETIONS, WHICH STIMULATE EMOTION, THAT IT CAN\nGAUGE YOUR FEELINGS EVEN MORE ACCURATELY THAN YOU YOURSELF CAN. THUS\nIT CAN JUDGE YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES QUITE ACCURATELY.\n  \n \n  WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU TEST OUR THEORY. THERE ARE DOZENS OF WAYS.\nIF YOU ARE STUMPED AND NEED SUGGESTIONS, JUST LET US KNOW. WE AWAIT\nWORD FROM YOU WITH GREAT INTEREST.\n  \n \n  SS II\n  \n \n  By now, Kaiser had accepted what had happened to him. His distress and\nanxiety were gone and he was impatient to do what he could to establish\nbetter contact with his uninvited tenant. With eager anticipation, he\nset to thinking how it could be done. After a few minutes, an idea\noccurred to him.\n  \n \n  Taking a small scalpel from a medical kit, he made a shallow cut in\nhis arm, just deep enough to bleed freely. He knew that the pain would\nsupply the necessary glandular reaction. The cut bled a few slow\ndrops\u2014and as Kaiser watched, a shiny film formed and the bleeding\nstopped.\n  \n \n  That checked pretty well with the ship's theory.\n  \n \n  Perhaps the symbiote had made his senses more acute. He tried closing\nhis eyes and fingering several objects in the room. It seemed to him\nthat he could determine the texture of each better than before, but\nthe test was inconclusive. Walking to the rear of the scout, he tried\nreading the printed words on the instrument panel. Each letter stood\nout sharp and clear!\n  \n \n  Kaiser wondered if he might not make an immediate, practical use of the\nsymbiote's apparent desire to help him. Concentrating on the discomfort\nof the high humidity and exaggerating his own displeasure with it, he\nwaited. The result surprised and pleased him.\n  \n \n  The temperature within the scout cabin seemed to lower, the moisture\non his body vanished, and he was more comfortable than he had yet been\nhere.\n  \n \n  As a double check, he looked at the ship's thermometer. Temperature\n102, humidity 113\u2014just about the same as it had been on earlier\nreadings.\n  \n<doc-sep>\n  The\n  cool green disk of Alphard\nSix on the screen was\ninfinitely welcome after the arid\ndesolation and stinking swamplands\nof the inner planets, an\nairy jewel of a world that might\nhave been designed specifically\nfor the hard-earned month of\nrest ahead. Navigator Farrell,\nyoungest and certainly most impulsive\nof the three-man Terran\nReclamations crew, would have\nset the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down at\nonce but for the greater caution\nof Stryker, nominally captain of\nthe group, and of Gibson, engineer,\nand linguist. Xavier, the\nship's little mechanical, had\u2014as\nwas usual and proper\u2014no voice\nin the matter.\n  \n \n  \"Reconnaissance spiral first,\nArthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He\nchuckled at Farrell's instant\nscowl, his little eyes twinkling\nand his naked paunch quaking\nover the belt of his shipboard\nshorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection\nFive, Paragraph Twenty-seven:\n   \n   No planetfall on an unreclaimed\nworld shall be deemed\nsafe without proper\u2014\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  Farrell, as Stryker had expected,\ninterrupted with characteristic\nimpatience. \"Do you\n   \n   sleep\n   \n  with that damned Reclamations\nHandbook, Lee? Alphard Six\nisn't an unreclaimed world\u2014it\nwas never colonized before the\nHymenop invasion back in 3025,\nso why should it be inhabited\nnow?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, who for four hours\nhad not looked up from his interminable\nchess game with\nXavier, paused with a beleaguered\nknight in one blunt brown\nhand.\n  \n \n  \"No point in taking chances,\"\nGibson said in his neutral baritone.\nHe shrugged thick bare\nshoulders, his humorless black-browed\nface unmoved, when\nFarrell included him in his\nscowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six\nlight-years from Sol, at\nthe old limits of Terran expansion,\nand there's no knowing\nwhat we may turn up here. Alphard's\nwas one of the first systems\nthe Bees took over. It must\nhave been one of the last to be\nabandoned when they pulled back\nto 70 Ophiuchi.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I think\n   \n   you\n   \n  live for the\nday,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when\nwe'll stumble across a functioning\ndome of live, buzzing Hymenops.\nDamn it, Gib, the Bees\npulled out a hundred years ago,\nbefore you and I were born\u2014neither\nof us ever saw a Hymenop,\nand never will!\"\n  \n \n  \"But I saw them,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"I fought them for the better\npart of the century they were\nhere, and I learned there's no\npredicting nor understanding\nthem. We never knew why they\ncame nor why they gave up and\nleft. How can we know whether\nthey'd leave a rear-guard or\nbooby trap here?\"\n  \n \n  He put a paternal hand on\nFarrell's shoulder, understanding\nthe younger man's eagerness\nand knowing that their close-knit\nteam would have been the\nmore poorly balanced without it.\n  \n \n  \"Gib's right,\" he said. He\nnearly added\n   \n   as usual\n   \n  . \"We're on\nrest leave at the moment, yes,\nbut our mission is still to find\nTerran colonies enslaved and\nabandoned by the Bees, not to\nrisk our necks and a valuable\nReorientations ship by landing\nblind on an unobserved planet.\nWe're too close already. Cut in\nyour shields and find a reconnaissance\nspiral, will you?\"\n  \n \n  Grumbling, Farrell punched\ncoordinates on the Ringwave\nboard that lifted the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  out of her descent and restored\nthe bluish enveloping haze of\nher repellors.\n  \n \n  Stryker's caution was justified\non the instant. The speeding\nstreamlined shape that had flashed\nup unobserved from below\nswerved sharply and exploded in\na cataclysmic blaze of atomic\nfire that rocked the ship wildly\nand flung the three men to the\nfloor in a jangling roar of\nalarms.\n  \n \n \n  \"So the Handbook tacticians\nknew what they were about,\"\nStryker said minutes later. Deliberately\nhe adopted the smug\ntone best calculated to sting Farrell\nout of his first self-reproach,\nand grinned when the navigator\nbristled defensively. \"Some of\ntheir enjoinders seem a little\nstuffy and obvious at times, but\nthey're eminently sensible.\"\n  \n \n  When Farrell refused to be\nbaited Stryker turned to Gibson,\nwho was busily assessing the\ndamage done to the ship's more\nfragile equipment, and to Xavier,\nwho searched the planet's\nsurface with the ship's magnoscanner.\nThe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , Ringwave\ngenerators humming gently,\nhung at the moment just\ninside the orbit of Alphard Six's\nsingle dun-colored moon.\n  \n \n  Gibson put down a test meter\nwith an air of finality.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing damaged but the\nZero Interval Transfer computer.\nI can realign that in a couple\nof hours, but it'll have to be\ndone before we hit Transfer\nagain.\"\n  \n \n \n  Stryker looked dubious.\n\"What if the issue is forced before\nthe ZIT unit is repaired?\nSuppose they come up after us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt that they can. Any\ninstallation crudely enough\nequipped to trust in guided missiles\nis hardly likely to have developed\nefficient space craft.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker was not reassured.\n  \n \n  \"That torpedo of theirs was\ndeadly enough,\" he said. \"And\nits nature reflects the nature of\nthe people who made it. Any race\nvicious enough to use atomic\ncharges is too dangerous to\ntrifle with.\" Worry made comical\ncreases in his fat, good-humored\nface. \"We'll have to find\nout who they are and why\nthey're here, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't be Hymenops,\"\nGibson said promptly. \"First,\nbecause the Bees pinned their\nfaith on Ringwave energy fields,\nas we did, rather than on missiles.\nSecond, because there's no\ndome on Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"There were three empty\ndomes on Five, which is a desert\nplanet,\" Farrell pointed out.\n\"Why didn't they settle Six? It's\na more habitable world.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"I know the\nBees always erected domes on\nevery planet they colonized, Arthur,\nbut precedent is a fallible\ntool. And it's even more firmly\nestablished that there's no possibility\nof our rationalizing the\nmotivations of a culture as alien\nas the Hymenops'\u2014we've been\nover that argument a hundred\ntimes on other reclaimed\nworlds.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was never an unreclaimed\nworld,\" Farrell said\nwith the faint malice of one too\nrecently caught in the wrong.\n\"Alphard Six was surveyed and\nseeded with Terran bacteria\naround the year 3000, but the\nBees invaded before we could\ncolonize. And that means we'll\nhave to rule out any resurgent\ncolonial group down there, because\nSix never had a colony in\nthe beginning.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Bees have been gone for\nover a hundred years,\" Stryker\nsaid. \"Colonists might have migrated\nfrom another Terran-occupied\nplanet.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson disagreed.\n  \n \n  \"We've touched at every inhabited\nworld in this sector, Lee,\nand not one surviving colony has\ndeveloped space travel on its\nown. The Hymenops had a hundred\nyears to condition their human\nslaves to ignorance of\neverything beyond their immediate\nenvironment\u2014the motives\nbehind that conditioning usually\nescape us, but that's beside the\npoint\u2014and they did a thorough\njob of it. The colonists have had\nno more than a century of freedom\nsince the Bees pulled out,\nand four generations simply\nisn't enough time for any subjugated\nculture to climb from\nslavery to interstellar flight.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker made a padding turn\nabout the control room, tugging\nunhappily at the scanty fringe\nof hair the years had left him.\n  \n \n  \"If they're neither Hymenops\nnor resurgent colonists,\" he said,\n\"then there's only one choice remaining\u2014they're\naliens from a\nsystem we haven't reached yet,\nbeyond the old sphere of Terran\nexploration. We always assumed\nthat we'd find other races out\nhere someday, and that they'd\nbe as different from us in form\nand motivation as the Hymenops.\nWhy not now?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson said seriously, \"Not\nprobable, Lee. The same objection\nthat rules out the Bees applies\nto any trans-Alphardian\nculture\u2014they'd have to be beyond\nthe atomic fission stage,\nelse they'd never have attempted\ninterstellar flight. The Ringwave\nwith its Zero Interval Transfer\nprinciple and instantaneous communications\napplications is the\nonly answer to long-range travel,\nand if they'd had that they\nwouldn't have bothered with\natomics.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker turned on him almost\nangrily. \"If they're not Hymenops\nor humans or aliens, then\nwhat in God's name\n   \n   are\n   \n  they?\"\n  \n \n \n  \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell\nsaid, quoting a passage\nwhose aptness had somehow seen\nit through a dozen reorganizations\nof insular tongue and a\nfinal translation to universal\nTerran. \"If they're none of those\nthree, we've only one conclusion\nleft. There's no one down there\nat all\u2014we're victims of the first\njoint hallucination in psychiatric\nhistory.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker threw up his hands in\nsurrender. \"We can't identify\nthem by theorizing, and that\nbrings us down to the business\nof first-hand investigation.\nWho's going to bell the cat this\ntime?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said\nat once. \"The ZIT computer can\nwait.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker vetoed his offer as\npromptly. \"No, the ZIT comes\nfirst. We may have to run for it,\nand we can't set up a Transfer\njump without the computer. It's\ngot to be me or Arthur.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell felt the familiar chill\nof uneasiness that inevitably\npreceded this moment of decision.\nHe was not lacking in courage,\nelse the circumstances under\nwhich he had worked for the\npast ten years\u2014the sometimes\nperilous, sometimes downright\ncharnel conditions left by the\nfleeing Hymenop conquerors\u2014would\nhave broken him long\nago. But that same hard experience\nhad honed rather than\nblunted the edge of his imagination,\nand the prospect of a close-quarters\nstalking of an unknown\nand patently hostile force was\nanything but attractive.\n  \n \n  \"You two did the field work\non the last location,\" he said.\n\"It's high time I took my turn\u2014and\nGod knows I'd go mad if\nI had to stay inship and listen\nto Lee memorizing his Handbook\nsubsections or to Gib practicing\ndead languages with Xavier.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker laughed for the first\ntime since the explosion that\nhad so nearly wrecked the\n   \n   Marco\nFour\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Good enough. Though it\nwouldn't be more diverting to\nlisten for hours to you improvising\nenharmonic variations on\nthe\n   \n   Lament for Old Terra\n   \n  with\nyour accordion.\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, characteristically, had\na refinement to offer.\n  \n \n  \"They'll be alerted down there\nfor a reconnaissance sally,\" he\nsaid. \"Why not let Xavier take\nthe scouter down for overt diversion,\nand drop Arthur off in\nthe helihopper for a low-level\ncheck?\"\n  \n \n  Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All\nright, Arthur?\"\n  \n \n  \"Good enough,\" Farrell said.\nAnd to Xavier, who had not\nmoved from his post at the magnoscanner:\n\"How does it look,\nXav? Have you pinned down\ntheir base yet?\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical answered him\nin a voice as smooth and clear\u2014and\nas inflectionless\u2014as a 'cello\nnote. \"The planet seems uninhabited\nexcept for a large island\nsome three hundred miles in\ndiameter. There are twenty-seven\nsmall agrarian hamlets surrounded\nby cultivated fields.\nThere is one city of perhaps a\nthousand buildings with a central\nsquare. In the square rests\na grounded spaceship of approximately\nten times the bulk\nof the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  They crowded about the vision\nscreen, jostling Xavier's jointed\ngray shape in their interest. The\ncentral city lay in minutest detail\nbefore them, the battered\nhulk of the grounded ship glinting\nrustily in the late afternoon\nsunlight. Streets radiated away\nfrom the square in orderly succession,\nthe whole so clearly\ndepicted that they could see the\nthrongs of people surging up\nand down, tiny foreshortened\nfaces turned toward the sky.\n  \n \n  \"At least they're human,\"\nFarrell said. Relief replaced in\nsome measure his earlier uneasiness.\n\"Which means that they're\nTerran, and can be dealt with\naccording to Reclamations routine.\nIs that hulk spaceworthy,\nXav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier's mellow drone assumed\nthe convention vibrato that\nindicated stark puzzlement. \"Its\nbreached hull makes the ship incapable\nof flight. Apparently it\nis used only to supply power to\nthe outlying hamlets.\"\n  \n \n  The mechanical put a flexible\ngray finger upon an indicator\ngraph derived from a composite\nsection of detector meters. \"The\npower transmitted seems to be\ngross electric current conveyed\nby metallic cables. It is generated\nthrough a crudely governed\nprocess of continuous atomic\nfission.\"\n  \n \n \n  Farrell, himself appalled by\nthe information, still found himself\nable to chuckle at Stryker's\nbellow of consternation.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Continuous fission?\n   \n  Good\nGod, only madmen would deliberately\nrun a risk like that!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell prodded him with\ncheerful malice. \"Why say mad\n   \n   men\n   \n  ? Maybe they're humanoid\naliens who thrive on hard radiation\nand look on the danger of\nbeing blown to hell in the middle\nof the night as a satisfactory\nrisk.\"\n  \n \n  \"They're not alien,\" Gibson\nsaid positively. \"Their architecture\nis Terran, and so is their\nship. The ship is incredibly\nprimitive, though; those batteries\nof tubes at either end\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Are thrust reaction jets,\"\nStryker finished in an awed\nvoice. \"Primitive isn't the word,\nGib\u2014the thing is prehistoric!\nRocket propulsion hasn't been\nused in spacecraft since\u2014how\nlong, Xav?\"\n  \n \n  Xavier supplied the information\nwith mechanical infallibility.\n\"Since the year 2100 when\nthe Ringwave propulsion-communication\nprinciple was discovered.\nThat principle has served\nmen since.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell stared in blank disbelief\nat the anomalous craft on\nthe screen. Primitive, as Stryker\nhad said, was not the word\nfor it: clumsily ovoid, studded\nwith torpedo domes and turrets\nand bristling at either end with\npropulsion tubes, it lay at the\ncenter of its square like a rusted\nrelic of a past largely destroyed\nand all but forgotten. What a\nmagnificent disregard its builders\nmust have had, he thought,\nfor their lives and the genetic\npurity of their posterity! The\nsullen atomic fires banked in\nthat oxidizing hulk\u2014\n  \n \n  Stryker said plaintively, \"If\nyou're right, Gib, then we're\nmore in the dark than ever. How\ncould a Terran-built ship eleven\nhundred years old get\n   \n   here\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's\ncontemplation of alternatives,\nseemed hardly to hear\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"If it's a Terran artifact,\nwe can discover the reason for\nits presence. If not\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Any problem posed by one\ngroup of human beings\n   \n  ,\" Stryker\nquoted his Handbook, \"\n   \n   can be\nresolved by any other group, regardless\nof ideology or conditioning,\nbecause the basic\nperceptive abilities of both must\nbe the same through identical\nheredity\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"If it's an imitation, and this\nis another Hymenop experiment\nin condition ecology, then we're\nstumped to begin with,\" Gibson\nfinished. \"Because we're not\nequipped to evaluate the psychology\nof alien motivation. We've\ngot to determine first which case\napplies here.\"\n  \n \n \n  He waited for Farrell's expected\nirony, and when the\nnavigator forestalled him by remaining\ngrimly quiet, continued.\n  \n \n  \"The obvious premise is that\na Terran ship must have been\nbuilt by Terrans. Question: Was\nit flown here, or built here?\"\n  \n \n  \"It couldn't have been built\nhere,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard\nSix was surveyed just before the\nBees took over in 3025, and there\nwas nothing of the sort here\nthen. It couldn't have been built\nduring the two and a quarter\ncenturies since; it's obviously\nmuch older than that. It was\nflown here.\"\n  \n \n  \"We progress,\" Farrell said\ndryly. \"Now if you'll tell us\n   \n   how\n   \n  ,\nwe're ready to move.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think the ship was built on\nTerra during the Twenty-second\nCentury,\" Gibson said calmly.\n\"The atomic wars during that\nperiod destroyed practically all\nhistorical records along with the\ntechnology of the time, but I've\nread well-authenticated reports\nof atomic-driven ships leaving\nTerra before then for the nearer\nstars. The human race climbed\nout of its pit again during the\nTwenty-third Century and developed\nthe technology that gave\nus the Ringwave. Certainly no\natomic-powered ships were built\nafter the wars\u2014our records are\ncomplete from that time.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head at the\ninference. \"I've read any number\nof fanciful romances on the\ntheme, Gib, but it won't stand\nup in practice. No shipboard society\ncould last through a thousand-year\nspace voyage. It's a\nphysical and psychological impossibility.\nThere's got to be\nsome other explanation.\"\n  \n \n \n  Gibson shrugged. \"We can\nonly eliminate the least likely\nalternatives and accept the simplest\none remaining.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we can eliminate this\none now,\" Farrell said flatly.",
        " \"It\nentails a thousand-year voyage,\nwhich is an impossibility for any\ngross reaction drive; the application\nof suspended animation\nor longevity or a successive-generation\nprogram, and a final\npenetration of Hymenop-occupied\nspace to set up a colony under\nthe very antennae of the\nBees. Longevity wasn't developed\nuntil around the year 3000\u2014Lee\nhere was one of the first to\nprofit by it, if you remember\u2014and\nsuspended animation is still\nto come. So there's one theory\nyou can forget.\"\n  \n \n  \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said\nreluctantly. \"An atomic-powered\nship\n   \n   couldn't\n   \n  have made such a\ntrip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant\nproject couldn't have\nlasted through forty generations,\nspeculative fiction to the\ncontrary\u2014the later generations\nwould have been too far removed\nin ideology and intent from\ntheir ancestors. They'd have\nadapted to shipboard life as the\nnorm. They'd have atrophied\nphysically, perhaps even have\nmutated\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"And they'd never have\nfought past the Bees during the\nHymenop invasion and occupation,\"\nFarrell finished triumphantly.\n\"The Bees had better\ndetection equipment than we\nhad. They'd have picked this\nship up long before it reached\nAlphard Six.\"\n  \n \n  \"But the ship wasn't here in\n3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is\nnow. Therefore it must have arrived\nat some time during the\ntwo hundred years of Hymenop\noccupation and evacuation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell, tangled in contradictions,\nswore bitterly. \"But\nwhy should the Bees let them\nthrough? The three domes on\nFive are over two hundred years\nold, which means that the Bees\nwere here before the ship came.\nWhy didn't they blast it or enslave\nits crew?\"\n  \n \n  \"We haven't touched on all the\npossibilities,\" Gibson reminded\nhim. \"We haven't even established\nyet that these people were\nnever under Hymenop control.\nPrecedent won't hold always, and\nthere's no predicting nor evaluating\nthe motives of an alien\nrace. We never understood the\nHymenops because there's no\ncommon ground of logic between\nus. Why try to interpret their\nintentions now?\"\n  \n \n  Farrell threw up his hands in\ndisgust. \"Next you'll say this is\nan ancient Terran expedition\nthat actually succeeded! There's\nonly one way to answer the\nquestions we've raised, and\nthat's to go down and see for\nourselves. Ready, Xav?\"\n  \n \n \n  But uncertainty nagged uneasily\nat him when Farrell found\nhimself alone in the helihopper\nwith the forest flowing beneath\nlike a leafy river and Xavier's\nscouter disappearing bulletlike\ninto the dusk ahead.\n  \n \n  We never found a colony so\nadvanced, Farrell thought. Suppose\nthis is a Hymenop experiment\nthat really paid off? The\nBees did some weird and wonderful\nthings with human\nguinea pigs\u2014what if they've\ncreated the ultimate booby trap\nhere, and primed it with conditioned\nmyrmidons in our own\nform?\n  \n \n  Suppose, he thought\u2014and derided\nhimself for thinking it\u2014one\nof those suicidal old interstellar\nventures\n   \n   did\n   \n  succeed?\n  \n \n  Xavier's voice, a mellow\ndrone from the helihopper's\nRingwave-powered visicom, cut\nsharply into his musing. \"The\nship has discovered the scouter\nand is training an electronic\nbeam upon it. My instruments\nrecord an electromagnetic vibration\npattern of low power but\nrapidly varying frequency. The\noperation seems pointless.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker's voice followed, querulous\nwith worry: \"I'd better\npull Xav back. It may be something\nlethal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised.\nSurprisingly, there was\nexcitement in the engineer's\nvoice. \"I think they're trying to\ncommunicate with us.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell was on the point of\ndemanding acidly to know how\none went about communicating\nby means of a fluctuating electric\nfield when the unexpected\ncessation of forest diverted his\nattention. The helihopper scudded\nover a cultivated area\nof considerable extent, fields\nstretching below in a vague random\ncheckerboard of lighter and\ndarker earth, an undefined cluster\nof buildings at their center.\nThere was a central bonfire that\nburned like a wild red eye\nagainst the lower gloom, and in\nits plunging ruddy glow he made\nout an urgent scurrying of shadowy\nfigures.\n  \n \n  \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\"\nFarrell reported. \"The one nearest\nthe city, I think. There's\nsomething odd going on\ndown\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Catastrophe struck so suddenly\nthat he was caught completely\nunprepared. The helihopper's\nflimsy carriage bucked and\ncrumpled. There was a blinding\nflare of electric discharge, a\npungent stink of ozone and a\nstunning shock that flung him\nheadlong into darkness.\n  \n \n \n  He awoke slowly with a brutal\nheadache and a conviction of\nnightmare heightened by the\noutlandish tone of his surroundings.\nHe lay on a narrow bed in\na whitely antiseptic infirmary,\nan oblong metal cell cluttered\nwith a grimly utilitarian array\nof tables and lockers and chests.\nThe lighting was harsh and\noverbright and the air hung\nthick with pungent unfamiliar\nchemical odors. From somewhere,\nfar off yet at the same\ntime as near as the bulkhead\nabove him, came the unceasing\ndrone of machinery.\n  \n \n  Farrell sat up, groaning,\nwhen full consciousness made his\nposition clear. He had been shot\ndown by God knew what sort of\ndevastating unorthodox weapon\nand was a prisoner in the\ngrounded ship.\n  \n \n  At his rising, a white-smocked\nfat man with anachronistic spectacles\nand close-cropped gray\nhair came into the room, moving\nwith the professional assurance\nof a medic. The man stopped\nshort at Farrell's stare and\nspoke; his words were utterly\nunintelligible, but his gesture\nwas unmistakable.\n  \n \n  Farrell followed him dumbly\nout of the infirmary and down\na bare corridor whose metal\nfloor rang coldly underfoot. An\nopen port near the corridor's end\nrelieved the blankness of wall\nand let in a flood of reddish Alphardian\nsunlight; Farrell slowed\nto look out, wondering how\nlong he had lain unconscious,\nand felt panic knife at him\nwhen he saw Xavier's scouter lying,\nport open and undefended,\non the square outside.\n  \n \n  The mechanical had been as\neasily taken as himself, then.\nStryker and Gibson, for all their\nprofessional caution, would fare\nno better\u2014they could not have\noverlooked the capture of Farrell\nand Xavier, and when they\ntried as a matter of course to\nrescue them the\n   \n   Marco\n   \n  would be\nstruck down in turn by the same\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The fat medic turned and\nsaid something urgent in his\nunintelligible tongue. Farrell,\ndazed by the enormity of what\nhad happened, followed without\nprotest into an intersecting way\nthat led through a bewildering\nsuccession of storage rooms and\nhydroponics gardens, through a\nsmall gymnasium fitted with\nphysical training equipment in\ngraduated sizes and finally into\na soundproofed place that could\nhave been nothing but a nursery.\n  \n \n  The implication behind its\npresence stopped Farrell short.\n  \n \n  \"A\n   \n   creche\n   \n  ,\" he said, stunned.\nHe had a wild vision of endless\ngenerations of children growing\nup in this dim and stuffy room,\nto be taught from their first\ntoddling steps the functions they\nmust fulfill before the venture\nof which they were a part could\nbe consummated.\n  \n \n  One of those old ventures\n   \n   had\n   \n  succeeded, he thought, and was\nawed by the daring of that thousand-year\nodyssey. The realization\nleft him more alarmed than\nbefore\u2014for what technical marvels\nmight not an isolated group\nof such dogged specialists have\ndeveloped during a millennium\nof application?\n  \n \n  Such a weapon as had brought\ndown the helihopper and scouter\nwas patently beyond reach of his\nown latter-day technology. Perhaps,\nhe thought, its possession\nexplained the presence of these\npeople here in the first stronghold\nof the Hymenops; perhaps\nthey had even fought and defeated\nthe Bees on their own invaded\nground.\n  \n \n  He followed his white-smocked\nguide through a power room\nwhere great crude generators\nwhirred ponderously, pouring\nout gross electric current into\narm-thick cables. They were\nnearing the bow of the ship\nwhen they passed by another\nopen port and Farrell, glancing\nout over the lowered rampway,\nsaw that his fears for Stryker\nand Gibson had been well\ngrounded.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  , ports open,\nlay grounded outside.\n  \n \n \n  Farrell could not have said,\nlater, whether his next move\nwas planned or reflexive. The\nwhole desperate issue seemed to\nhang suspended for a breathless\nmoment upon a hair-fine edge of\ndecision, and in that instant he\nmade his bid.\n  \n \n  Without pausing in his stride\nhe sprang out and through the\nport and down the steep plane\nof the ramp. The rough stone\npavement of the square drummed\nunderfoot; sore muscles\ntore at him, and weakness was\nlike a weight about his neck. He\nexpected momentarily to be\nblasted out of existence.\n  \n \n  He reached the\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  with the startled shouts of his\nguide ringing unintelligibly in\nhis ears. The port yawned; he\nplunged inside and stabbed at\ncontrols without waiting to seat\nhimself. The ports swung shut.\nThe ship darted up under his\nmanipulation and arrowed into\nspace with an acceleration that\nsprung his knees and made his\nvision swim blackly.\n  \n \n  He was so weak with strain\nand with the success of his coup\nthat he all but fainted when\nStryker, his scanty hair tousled\nand his fat face comical with bewilderment,\nstumbled out of his\nsleeping cubicle and bellowed at\nhim.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell are you doing,\nArthur? Take us down!\"\n  \n \n  Farrell gaped at him, speechless.\n  \n \n  Stryker lumbered past him\nand took the controls, spiraling\nthe\n   \n   Marco Four\n   \n  down. Men\nswarmed outside the ports when\nthe Reclamations craft settled\ngently to the square again. Gibson\nand Xavier reached the ship\nfirst; Gibson came inside quickly,\nleaving the mechanical outside\nmaking patient explanations\nto an excited group of Alphardians.\n  \n \n  Gibson put a reassuring hand\non Farrell's arm. \"It's all right,\nArthur. There's no trouble.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell said dumbly, \"I don't\nunderstand. They didn't shoot\nyou and Xav down too?\"\n  \n \n  It was Gibson's turn to stare.\n  \n \n  \"No one shot you down! These\npeople are primitive enough to\nuse metallic power lines to\ncarry electricity to their hamlets,\nan anachronism you forgot\nlast night. You piloted the helihopper\ninto one of those lines,\nand the crash put you out for\nthe rest of the night and most\nof today. These Alphardians are\nfriendly, so desperately happy to\nbe found again that it's really\npathetic.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Friendly?\n   \n  That torpedo\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"It wasn't a torpedo at all,\"\nStryker put in. Understanding\nof the error under which Farrell\nhad labored erased his\nearlier irritation, and he chuckled\ncommiseratingly. \"They had\none small boat left for emergency\nmissions, and sent it up to\ncontact us in the fear that we\nmight overlook their settlement\nand move on. The boat was\natomic powered, and our shield\nscreens set off its engines.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell dropped into a chair at\nthe chart table, limp with reaction.\nHe was suddenly exhausted,\nand his head ached dully.\n  \n \n  \"We cracked the communications\nproblem early last night,\"\nGibson said. \"These people use\nan ancient system of electromagnetic\nwave propagation called\nfrequency modulation, and once\nLee and I rigged up a suitable\ntransceiver the rest was simple.\nBoth Xav and I recognized the\nold language; the natives reported\nyour accident, and we came\ndown at once.\"\n  \n \n  \"They really came from Terra?\nThey lived through a thousand\nyears of flight?\"\n  \n \n  \"The ship left Terra for\nSirius in 2171,\" Gibson said.\n\"But not with these people\naboard, or their ancestors. That\nexpedition perished after less\nthan a light-year when its\nhydroponics system failed. The\nHymenops found the ship derelict\nwhen they invaded us, and\nbrought it to Alphard Six in\nwhat was probably their first experiment\nwith human subjects.\nThe ship's log shows clearly\nwhat happened to the original\ncomplement. The rest is deducible\nfrom the situation here.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell put his hands to his\ntemples and groaned. \"The crash\nmust have scrambled my wits.\nGib, where\n   \n   did\n   \n  they come from?\"\n  \n \n  \"From one of the first peripheral\ncolonies conquered by the\nBees,\" Gibson said patiently.\n\"The Hymenops were long-range\nplanners, remember, and masters\nof hypnotic conditioning. They\nstocked the ship with a captive\ncrew of Terrans conditioned to\nbelieve themselves descendants\nof the original crew, and\ngrounded it here in disabled\ncondition. They left for Alphard\nFive then, to watch developments.\n  \n \n  \"Succeeding generations of\ncolonists grew up accepting the\nfact that their ship had missed\nSirius and made planetfall here\u2014they\nstill don't know where\nthey really are\u2014by luck. They\nnever knew about the Hymenops,\nand they've struggled along\nwith an inadequate technology in\nthe hope that a later expedition\nwould find them. They found the\ntruth hard to take, but they're\neager to enjoy the fruits of Terran\nassimilation.\"\n  \n \n  Stryker, grinning, brought\nFarrell a frosted drink that tinkled\ninvitingly. \"An unusually\nfortunate ending to a Hymenop\nexperiment,\" he said. \"These\npeople progressed normally because\nthey've been let alone. Reorienting\nthem will be a simple\nmatter; they'll be properly spoiled\ncolonists within another generation.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell sipped his drink appreciatively.\n  \n \n  \"But I don't see why the Bees\nshould go to such trouble to deceive\nthese people. Why did they\nsit back and let them grow as\nthey pleased, Gib? It doesn't\nmake sense!\"\n  \n \n  \"But it does, for once,\" Gibson\nsaid. \"The Bees set up this\ncolony as a control unit to study\nthe species they were invading,\nand they had to give their\nspecimens a normal\u2014if obsolete\u2014background\nin order to determine\ntheir capabilities. The fact\nthat their experiment didn't tell\nthem what they wanted to know\nmay have had a direct bearing\non their decision to pull out.\"\n  \n \n  Farrell shook his head. \"It's\na reverse application, isn't it of\nthe old saw about Terrans being\nincapable of understanding an\nalien culture?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" said Gibson, surprised.\n\"It's obvious enough,\nsurely\u2014hard as they tried, the\nBees never understood us\neither.\"\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Amazing Science Fiction Stories\n  \n January\n1960.

On his arm was the silver fist insignia of the\nConqueror Corps. Marsha Rennels sat on the extreme right and now there\nwas no emotion at all on her trim, neat face.\n  \n \n  He remembered her as she had been years ago, but at the moment he\nwasn't looking very hard to see anything on her face. It was too late.\nThey had gotten her young and it was too late.\n  \n \n  Terrence's big, square face frowned a little. Bruce was aware suddenly\nof the sound of the bleak, never-ending wind against the plastilene\nshelter. He remembered the strange misty shapes that had come to him in\nhis dreams, the voices that had called to him, and how disappointed he\nhad been when he woke from them.\n  \n \n  \"This is a mere formality,\" Terrence finally said, \"since we all know\nyou killed Lieutenant Doran a few hours ago. Marsha saw you kill him.\nWhatever you say goes on the record, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"For whom?\" Bruce asked.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of question is that? For the authorities on Earth when we\nget back.\"\n  \n \n  \"When you get back? Like the crews of those other four ships out\nthere?\" Bruce laughed without much humor.\n  \n \n  Terrence rubbed a palm across his lips, dropped the hand quickly again\nto his belly. \"You want to make a statement or not? You shot Doran in\nthe head with a rifle. No provocation for the attack. You've wasted\nenough of my time with your damn arguments and anti-social behavior.\nThis is a democratic group. Everyone has his say. But you've said too\nmuch, and done too much. Freedom doesn't allow you to go around killing\nfellow crew-members!\"\n  \n \n  \"Any idea that there was any democracy or freedom left died on Venus,\"\nBruce said.\n  \n \n  \"Now we get another lecture!\" Terrence exploded. He leaned forward.\n\"You're sick, Bruce. They did a bad psych job on you. They should never\nhave sent you on this trip. We need strength, all the strength we can\nfind. You don't belong here.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce agreed indifferently. \"I was drafted for this trip. I\ntold them I shouldn't be brought along. I said I didn't want any part\nof it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you're afraid. You're not Conqueror material. That's why you\nbacked down when we all voted to climb the mountain. And what the devil\ndoes Venus\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  Max Drexel's freckles slipped into the creases across his high\nforehead. \"Haven't you heard him expounding on the injustice done to\nthe Venusian aborigines, Captain? If you haven't, you aren't thoroughly\neducated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people.\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't heard it,\" Terrence admitted. \"What injustice?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce said, \"I guess it couldn't really be considered an injustice\nany longer. Values have changed too much. Doran and I were part of the\ncrew of that first ship to hit Venus, five years ago. Remember? One\nof the New Era's more infamous dates. Drexel says the Venusians were\naborigines. No one ever got a chance to find out. We ran into this\nvillage. No one knows how old it was. There were intelligent beings\nthere. One community left on the whole planet, maybe a few thousand\ninhabitants. They made their last mistake when they came out to greet\nus. Without even an attempt at communication, they were wiped out. The\nvillage was burned and everything alive in it was destroyed.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt the old weakness coming into his knees, the sweat beginning\nto run down his face. He took a deep breath and stood there before the\ncold nihilistic stares of fourteen eyes.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Bruce said. \"I apologize. None of you know what I'm talking\nabout.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded. \"You're psycho. It's as simple as that. They pick the\nmost capable for these conquests. Even the flights are processes of\nelimination. Eventually we get the very best, the most resilient, the\nreal conquering blood. You just don't pass, Bruce. Listen, what do you\nthink gives you the right to stand here in judgment against the laws\nof the whole Solar System?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are plenty on Earth who agree with me,\" Bruce said. \"I can say\nwhat I think now because you can't do more than kill me and you'll do\nthat regardless....\"\n  \n \n  He stopped. This was ridiculous, a waste of his time. And theirs. They\nhad established a kind of final totalitarianism since the New Era. The\npsychologists, the Pavlovian Reflex boys, had done that. If you didn't\nwant to be reconditioned to fit into the social machine like a human\nvacuum tube, you kept your mouth shut. And for many, when the mouth was\nkept shut long enough, the mind pretty well forgot what it had wanted\nto open the mouth for in the first place.\n  \n \n  A minority in both segments of a world split into two factions.\nBoth had been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically, for\ncenturies, clung to old ideas of freedom, democracy, self-determinism,\nindividualism. To most, the words had no meaning now. It was a question\nof which set of conquering heroes could conquer the most space first.\nSo far, only Venus had fallen. They had done a good, thorough job\nthere. Four ships had come to Mars and their crews had disappeared.\nThis was the fifth attempt\u2014\n  \n"

        " \n  It all began on a Saturday\nnight at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  . If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\n  \n \n  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\n  \n \n  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n<doc-sep>I didn't realize it was a derelict when Spinelli first reported\nit from the forward scope position. I assumed it was a Foundation\nship. The Holcomb Foundation was founded for the purpose of\ndeveloping spaceflight, and as the years went by it took on the whole\nresponsibility for the building and dispatching of space ships. Never\nin history had there been any real evidence of extra-terrestrial\nintelligent life, and when the EMV Triangle proved barren, we all just\nassumed that the Universe was man's own particular oyster. That kind of\nunreasoning arrogance is as hard to explain as it is to correct.\n  \n \n  There were plenty of ships being lost in space, and immediately that\nSpinelli's report from up forward got noised about the Maid every one\nof us started mentally counting up his share of the salvage money. All\nthis before we were within ten thousand miles of the hulk!\n  \n \n  All spaceships look pretty much alike, but as I sat at the telescope\nI saw that there was something different about this one. At such a\ndistance I couldn't get too much detail in our small three inch glass,\nbut I could see that the hulk was big\u2014bigger than any ship I'd ever\nseen before. I had the radar fixed on her and then I retired with my\nslide rule to Control. It wasn't long before I discovered that the\nderelict ship was on a near collision course, but there was something\nabout its orbit that was strange. I called Cohn, the Metering Officer,\nand showed him my figures.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn,\" I said, chart in hand, \"do these figures look right to\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  Cohn's dark eyes lit up as they always did when he worked with figures.\nIt didn't take him long to check me. \"The math is quite correct,\nCaptain,\" he said. I could see that he hadn't missed the inference of\nthose figures on the chart.\n  \n \n  \"Assemble the ship's company, Mister Cohn,\" I ordered.\n  \n \n  The assembly horn sounded throughout the Maid and I could feel the tug\nof the automatics taking over as the crew left their stations. Soon\nthey were assembled in Control.\n  \n \n  \"You have all heard about Mister Spinelli's find,\" I said, \"I have\ncomputed the orbit and inspected the object through the glass. It seems\nto be a spacer ... either abandoned or in distress....\" Reaching into\nthe book rack above my desk I took down a copy of the Foundation's\n   \n   Space Regulations\n   \n  and opened it to the section concerning salvage.\n  \n \n  \"Sections XVIII, Paragraph 8 of the Code Regulating Interplanetary\nAstrogation and Commerce,\" I read, \"Any vessel or part of vessel found\nin an abandoned or totally disabled condition in any region of space\nnot subject to the sovereignty of any planet of the Earth-Venus-Mars\nTriangle shall be considered to be the property of the crew of the\nvessel locating said abandoned or disabled vessel except in such cases\nas the ownership of said abandoned or disabled vessel may be readily\nascertained....\" I looked up and closed the book. \"Simply stated, that\nmeans that if that thing ahead of us is a derelict we are entitled to\nclaim it as salvage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Unless it already belongs to someone?\" asked Spinelli.\n  \n \n  \"That's correct Mister Spinelli, but I don't think there is much danger\nof that,\" I replied quietly. \"My figures show that hulk out there came\nin from the direction of Coma Berenices....\"\n  \n \n  There was a long silence before Zaleski shifted his two hundred pounds\nuneasily and gave a form to the muted fear inside me. \"You think ...\nyou think it came from the\n   \n   stars\n   \n  , Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe even from beyond the stars,\" Cohn said in a low voice.\n  \n \n  Looking at that circle of faces I saw the beginnings of greed. The\nfirst impact of the Metering Officer's words wore off quickly and soon\nevery man of my crew was thinking that anything from the stars would be\nworth money ... lots of money.\n  \n \n  Spinelli said, \"Do we look her over, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  They all looked at me, waiting for my answer. I knew it would be worth\nplenty, and money hunger was like a fever inside me.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly we look it over, Mister Spinelli,\" I said sharply.\n\"Certainly!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Young Peter Karson put the last black-print down and sighed with\nsatisfaction. His dream was perfect; the\n   \n   Citadel\n   \n  was complete, every\nminutest detail provided for\u2014on paper. In two weeks they would be\nlaying the core, and then the metal giant itself would begin to grow,\nglittering, pulsing with each increment of power, until at last it lay\nfinished, a living thing.\n  \n \n  Then there would remain only the task of blasting the great, shining\nship out into the carefully-calculated orbit that would be its home.\nIn his mind's eye he could see it, slowly wheeling, like a second\nsatellite, about the Earth; endlessly gathering knowledge into its\ninsatiable mechanisms. He could see, too, the level on level of\nlaboratories and storerooms that filled its interlocking segments; the\nmeteor deflectors, the air renewal system, the mighty engines at the\nstern\u2014all the children of his brain.\n  \n \n  Out there, away from the muffling, distorting, damnable blanket of\natmosphere, away from Earth's inexorable gravitational pull, would be\na laboratory such as man had never seen. The ship would be filled with\nthe sounds of busy men and women, wresting secrets from the reluctant\nether. A new chemistry, a new physics; perhaps even a new biochemistry.\n  \n \n  A discordant note suddenly entered his fantasy. He looked up, conscious\nof the walls of his office again, but could see nothing unusual. Still,\nthat thin, dark whisper of dread was at the back of his mind. Slowly,\nas if reluctantly compelled, he turned around to face the window at his\nback.\n  \n \n  There, outside the window, fifty stories up, a face was staring\nimpassively in at him. That was the first impression he got; just a\nface, staring. Then he saw, with a queer, icy chill, that the face was\nblood-red and subtly inhuman. It tapered off into a formless, shriveled\nbody.\n  \n \n  For a moment or an eternity it hung there, unsupported, the bulging\neyes staring at him. Then it grew misty at the edges. It dissolved\nslowly away and was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Lord!\" he said.\n  \n \n  He stared after it, stunned into immobility. Down in the street\nsomewhere, a portable video was shrilling a popular song; after a\nmoment he heard the faint swish of a tube car going past. Everything\nwas normal. Nothing, on examination, seemed to have changed. But the\nworld had grown suddenly unreal.\n  \n \n  One part of his brain had been shocked into its shell. It was hiding\nfrom the thing that had hurt it, and it refused to respond. But the\nother part was going calmly, lucidly on, quite without his volition.\nIt considered the possibility that he had gone temporarily insane, and\ndecided that this was probable.\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he found a cigarette and lit it. His hands\nwere shaking. He stared at them dully, and then he reached over to the\nnewsbox on his desk, and switched it on.\n  \n \n  There were flaring red headlines.\n  \n \n  Relief washed over him, leaving him breathless. He was horrified,\nof course, but only abstractedly. For the moment he could only be\nglad that what he had seen was terrible reality rather than even more\nterrible illusion.\n  \n \n  INVADERS APPEAR IN BOSTON.\n   \n  200 DEAD\n  \n \n  Then lines of type, and farther down:\n  \n \n  50 CHILDREN DISAPPEAR FROM\n   \n  PARIS MATERNITY CENTER\n  \n \n  He pressed the stud.

The order was made public early this morning by\nR. Stein, Secretary of the Council, who said in part:\n  \n \n  \"The reason for this ... order must be apparent to all civilized\npeoples. For the Invaders have spared no part of this planet in their\ndepredations: they have laid Hong Kong waste; they have terrorized\nLondon; they have destroyed the lives of citizens in every member state\nand in every inhabited area. There can be few within reach of printed\nreports or my words who have not seen the Invaders, or whose friends\nhave not seen them.\n  \n \n  \"The peoples of the world, then, know what they are, and know that\nwe face the most momentous struggle in our history. We face an enemy\n   \n   superior to ourselves in every way\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Since the Invaders first appeared in Wood River, Oregon, 24 hours\nago, they have not once acknowledged our attempts to communicate, or\nin any way taken notice of our existence as reasoning beings. They\nhave treated us precisely as we, in less enlightened days, might\nhave treated a newly-discovered race of lower animals. They have not\nattacked our centers of government, nor immobilized our communications,\nnor laid siege to our defenses. But in instance after instance, they\nhave done as they would with us. They have examined us, dissected us,\ndriven us mad, killed us with no discernable provocation; and this is\nmore intolerable than any normal invasion.\n  \n \n  \"I have no fear that the people of Earth will fail to meet this\nchallenge, for there is no alternative. Not only our individual lives\nare threatened, but our existence as a race. We must, and will, destroy\nthe Invaders!\"\n  \n \n  Peter sank back in his chair, the full shock of it striking him for the\nfirst time.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Will\n   \n  we?\" he asked himself softly.\n  \n"

Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway\u2014for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped\u2014and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why\u2014er\u2014you see, Joggy\u2014\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n  \n"

But nothing like the\nweird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.\n    \n \n \n<doc-sep>\n  There\n  was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the\ntiny microphone on the outside of his\nsuit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go\nthrough his body. Then it seemed as if a\nhalf dozen hands were inside him, examining\nhis internal organs. His stomach contracted.\nHe felt a squeeze on his heart. His\nlungs tickled.\n  \n \n  There were several more queer motions\ninside his body.\n  \n \n  Then another Steel-Blue voice said:\n  \n \n  \"He is a soft-metal creature, made up of\nmetals that melt at a very low temperature.\nHe also contains a liquid whose makeup I\ncannot ascertain by ray-probe. Bring him\nback when the torture is done.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What\nkind of torture could this be?\n  \n \n  Would it last 21 days? He glanced at the\nchronometer on his wrist.\n  \n \n  Jon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien\nship and halted expectantly just outside the\nship's lock.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the\nstubray pistol holstered at his hip. Shoot my\nway out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he\ntoted up the disadvantages.\n  \n \n  He either would have to find a hiding\nplace on the asteroid, and if the Steel-Blues\nwanted him bad enough they could tear the\nwhole place to pieces, or somehow get\naboard the little life ship hidden in the\nservice station.\n  \n \n  In that he would be just a sitting duck.\n  \n \n  He shrugged off the slight temptation to\nuse the pistol. He was still curious.\n  \n \n  And he was interested in staying alive as\nlong as possible. There was a remote chance\nhe might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously,\nhe glanced toward his belt to see the little\npower pack which, if under ideal conditions,\ncould finger out fifty thousand miles into\nspace.\n  \n \n  If he could somehow stay alive the 21\ndays he might be able to warn the patrol.\nHe couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for\nhis life would be snuffed out immediately.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue said quietly:\n  \n \n  \"It might be ironical to let you warn\nthat SP ship you keep thinking about. But\nwe know your weapon now. Already our\nship is equipped with a force field designed\nespecially to deflect your atomic guns.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts\nquickly. They can delve deeper than the\nsurface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a\nleash on my thoughts?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue chuckled. \"You get\u2014absent-minded,\nis it?\u2014every once in a\nwhile.\"\n  \n \n  Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared\nlugging great sheets of plastic and various\nother equipment.\n  \n \n  They dumped their loads and began unbundling\nthem.\n  \n \n  Working swiftly, they built a plastic\nigloo, smaller than the living room in the\nlarger service station igloo. They ranged instruments\ninside\u2014one of them Jon Karyl\nrecognized as an air pump from within the\nstation\u2014and they laid out a pallet.\n  \n \n  When they were done Jon saw a miniature\nreproduction of the service station, lacking\nonly the cannon cap and fin, and with clear\nplastic walls instead of the opaqueness of the\nother.\n  \n \n  His Steel-Blue said: \"We have reproduced\nthe atmosphere of your station so that you\nbe watched while you undergo the torture\nunder the normal conditions of your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is this torture?\" Jon Karyl asked.\n  \n \n  The answer was almost caressing: \"It is\na liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes\njoints to harden if even so much as a drop\nremains on it long. It eats away the metal,\nleaving a scaly residue which crumbles\neventually into dust.\n  \n \n  \"We will dilute it with a harmless liquid\nfor you since No. 1 does not wish you to die\ninstantly.\n  \n \n  \"Enter your\"\u2014the Steel-Blue hesitated\u2014\"mausoleum.\nYou die in your own atmosphere.\nHowever, we took the liberty of purifying\nit. There were dangerous elements in\nit.\"\n  \n \n  Jon walked into the little igloo. The\nSteel-Blues sealed the lock, fingered dials\nand switches on the outside. Jon's space suit\ndeflated. Pressure was building up in the\nigloo.\n  \n \n  He took a sample of the air, found that\nit was good, although quite rich in oxygen\ncompared with what he'd been using in the\nservice station and in his suit.\n  \n \n  With a sigh of relief he took off his helmet\nand gulped huge draughts of the air.\n  \n \n  He sat down on the pallet and waited\nfor the torture to begin.\n  \n \n  The Steel Blues crowded about the igloo,\nstaring at him through elliptical eyes.\n  \n \n  Apparently, they too, were waiting for the\ntorture to begin.\n  \n \n  Jon thought the excess of oxygen was\nmaking him light-headed.\n  \n \n  He stared at a cylinder which was beginning\nto sprout tentacles from the circle.\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked again. An\nopening, like the adjustable eye-piece of a\nspacescope, was appearing in the center of\nthe cylinder.\n  \n \n  A square, glass-like tumbler sat in the\nopening disclosed in the four-foot cylinder\nthat had sprouted tentacles. It contained a\nyellowish liquid.\n  \n \n  One of the tentacles reached into the\nopening and clasped the glass. The opening\nclosed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor\nappendages, moved toward Jon.\n  \n \n  He didn't like the looks of the liquid in\nthe tumbler. It looked like an acid of some\nsort. He raised to his feet.\n  \n \n  He unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared\nto blast the cylinder.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\n  The\n  cylinder moved so fast Jon felt his\neyes jump in his head. He brought the\nstubray gun up\u2014but he was helpless. The\npistol kept on going up. With a deft movement,\none of the tentacles had speared it\nfrom his hand and was holding it out of\nhis reach.\n  \n \n  Jon kicked at the glass in the cylinder's\nhand. But he was too slow. Two tentacles\ngripped the kicking leg. Another struck him\nin the chest, knocking him to the pallet. The\nsame tentacle, assisted by a new one,\npinioned his shoulders.\n  \n \n  Four tentacles held him supine. The cylinder\nlifted a glass-like cap from the tumbler\nof liquid.\n  \n \n  Lying there helplessly, Jon was remembering\nan old fairy tale he'd read as a kid.\nSomething about a fellow named Socrates\nwho was given a cup of hemlock to drink.\nIt was the finis for Socrates. But the old\nhero had been nonchalant and calm about\nthe whole thing.\n  \n \n  With a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious\nunto death, relaxed and said, \"All right,\nbub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll\ntake it like a man.\"\n  \n \n  The cylinder apparently understood him,\nfor it handed him the tumbler. It even reholstered\nhis stubray pistol.\n  \n \n  Jon brought the glass of liquid under his\nnose. The fumes of the liquid were pungent.\nIt brought tears to his eyes.\n  \n \n  He looked at the cylinder, then at the\nSteel-Blues crowding around the plastic\nigloo. He waved the glass at the audience.\n  \n \n  \"To Earth, ever triumphant,\" he toasted.\nThen he drained the glass at a gulp.\n  \n \n  Its taste was bitter, and he felt hot\nprickles jab at his scalp. It was like eating\nvery hot peppers. His eyes filled with tears.\nHe coughed as the stuff went down.\n  \n \n  But he was still alive, he thought in\namazement. He'd drunk the hemlock and\nwas still alive.\n  \n \n  The reaction set in quickly. He hadn't\nknown until then how tense he'd been. Now\nwith the torture ordeal over, he relaxed. He\nlaid down on the pallet and went to sleep.\n  \n \n  There was one lone Steel-Blue watching\nhim when he rubbed the sleep out of his\neyes and sat up.\n  \n \n  He vanished almost instantly. He, or another\nlike him, returned immediately accompanied\nby a half-dozen others, including\nthe multi-tentacled creature known as No. 1.\n  \n \n  One said,\n  \n \n  \"You are alive.\" The thought registered\namazement. \"When you lost consciousness,\nwe thought you had\"\u2014there was a hesitation\u2014\"as\nyou say, died.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Jon Karyl said. \"I didn't die. I\nwas just plain dead-beat so I went to sleep.\"\nThe Steel-Blues apparently didn't understand.\n  \n \n  \"Good it is that you live. The torture\nwill continue,\" spoke No. 1 before loping\naway.\n  \n \n  The cylinder business began again. This\ntime, Jon drank the bitter liquid slowly, trying\nto figure out what it was. It had a\nfamiliar, tantalizing taste but he couldn't\nquite put a taste-finger on it.\n  \n \n  His belly said he was hungry. He glanced\nat his chronometer. Only 20 days left before\nthe SP ship arrived.\n  \n \n  Would this torture\u2014he chuckled\u2014last\nuntil then? But he was growing more and\nmore conscious that his belly was screaming\nfor hunger. The liquid had taken the edge\noff his thirst.\n  \n \n  It was on the fifth day of his torture that\nJon Karyl decided that he was going to get\nsomething to eat or perish in the attempt.\n  \n \n  The cylinder sat passively in its niche in\nthe circle. A dozen Steel-Blues were watching\nas Jon put on his helmet and unsheathed\nhis stubray.\n  \n \n  They merely watched as he pressed the\nstubray's firing stud. Invisible rays licked\nout of the bulbous muzzle of the pistol.\nThe plastic splintered.\n  \n \n  Jon was out of his goldfish bowl and\nstriding toward his own igloo adjacent to\nthe service station when a Steel-Blue\naccosted him.\n  \n \n  \"Out of my way,\" grunted Jon, waving\nthe stubray. \"I'm hungry.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm the first Steel-Blue you met,\" said\nthe creature who barred his way. \"Go back\nto your torture.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm so hungry I'll chew off one of\nyour tentacles and eat it without seasoning.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eat?\" The Steel-Blue sounded puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"I want to refuel. I've got to have food\nto keep my engine going.\"\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue chuckled. \"So the hemlock, as\nyou call it, is beginning to affect you at\nlast? Back to the torture room.\"\n  \n \n  \"Like R-dust,\" Jon growled. He pressed\nthe firing stud on the stubray gun. One of\nSteel-Blue's tentacles broke off and fell to\nthe rocky sward.\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue jerked out the box he'd used\nonce before. A tentacle danced over it.\n  \n \n  Abruptly Jon found himself standing on\na pinnacle of rock. Steel-Blue had cut a\nswath around him 15 feet deep and five feet\nwide.\n  \n \n  \"Back to the room,\" Steel-Blue commanded.\n  \n \n  Jon resheathed the stubray pistol,\nshrugged non-committally and leaped the\ntrench. He walked slowly back and reentered\nthe torture chamber.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues rapidly repaired the damage\nhe'd done.\n  \n \n  As he watched them, Jon was still curious,\nbut he was getting mad underneath at\nthe cold egoism of the Steel-Blues.\n  \n \n  By the shimmering clouds of Earth, by\nher green fields, and dark forests, he'd\nstay alive to warn the SP ship.\n  \n \n  Yes, he'd stay alive till then. And send\nthe story of the Steel-Blues' corrosive acid\nto it. Then hundreds of Earth's ships could\nequip themselves with spray guns and squirt\ncitric acid and watch the Steel-Blues fade\naway.\n  \n \n  It sounded almost silly to Jon Karyl. The\nfruit acid of Earth to repel these invaders\u2014it\ndoesn't sound possible. That couldn't be\nthe answer.\n  \n \n  Citric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl\ndiscovered a week later.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue who had captured him in\nthe power room of the service station came\nin to examine him.\n  \n \n  \"You're still holding out, I see,\" he observed\nafter poking Jon in every sensitive\npart of his body.\n  \n \n  \"I'll suggest to No. 1 that we increase\nthe power of the\u2014ah\u2014hemlock. How do\nyou feel?\"\n  \n \n  Between the rich oxygen and the dizziness\nof hunger, Jon was a bit delirious. But he\nanswered honestly enough: \"My guts feel as\nif they're chewing each other up. My bones\nache. My joints creak. I can't coordinate I'm\nso hungry.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is the hemlock,\" Steel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  It was when he quaffed the new and\nstronger draught that Jon knew that his\nhope that it was citric acid was squelched.\n  \n \n  The acid taste was weaker which meant\nthat the citric acid was the diluting liquid.\nIt was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath\nthe tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive\nacid.\n  \n \n  On the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak\nhe didn't feel much like moving around. He\nlet the cylinder feed him the hemlock.\n  \n \n  No. 1 came again to see him, and went\naway chuckling, \"Decrease the dilution.\nThis Earthman at last is beginning to\nsuffer.\"\n  \n \n"

I let myself into the apartment, which\nhad an absentee-wife look, and took a cold shower. The present downtown\ntemperature, according to the radio, was eighty-seven degrees, but\naccording to my Greenwich Village thermometer, it was ninety-six. I got\ndressed and went into the living room, and wished ardently that my\nwife Molly were here to tell me why the whole place looked so woebegone.\n  \n \n  What do they do, I asked myself, that I have left undone?

I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella\nwhen I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost\ntropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a\nwoman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.\n  \n \n  \"Madison and Fifty-fourth,\" I said.\n  \n \n  \"Right,\" said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go\non grinding. After some futile efforts, he turned to me. \"Sorry, Mac.\nYou'll have to find another cab. Good hunting.\"\n  \n \n  If possible, it was raining still harder. I opened my newspaper over\nmy hat and ran for the subway: three blocks. Whizzing traffic held\nme up at each crossing and I was soaked when I reached the platform,\njust in time to miss the local. After an abnormal delay, I got one\nwhich exactly missed the express at Fourteenth Street.

There are some who tell me, however, that my refusal to honor\nsuch time-tested cliches is why I only have a small private laboratory\nowned by myself, my late wife's father and the bank, instead of\nworking in the vast facilities of Bell, Du Pont, or General Motors. To\nthis, I can only smile and nod.\n  \n \n  But even refusing to be balked by conservative ideas, I failed.\n  \n \n  I could not neutralize radioactivity. All I had been able to do (by a\nbasic disturbance in the electromagnetogravitational co-ordinant system\nfor Earth-Sun) was to reduce the mass of the radioactive matter.\n  \n \n  This only concentrated the radiations, as in boiling contaminated\nwater. It did make the hot stuff vaguely easier to handle, but it was\nno breakthrough on the central problem.\n  \n \n  Now, in the middle of this, I was supposed to find a way to get rid of\nsome damned bodies for Carmen.\n  \n \n  Pressed for time and knowing the results wouldn't have to be so\nprecise or carefully defined for a racketeer as for the United States\ngovernment, I began experimenting.\n  \n \n  I cut corners.\n  \n \n  I bypassed complete safety circuits.\n  \n \n  I put dangerous overloads on some transformers and doodled with the\nwiring diagrams. If I got some kind of passable incinerator I would be\nhappy.\n  \n \n  I turned the machine on.\n  \n \n  The lights popped out.\n  \n \n  There were changes that should be made before I tried that again, but\ninstead I only found a larger fuse for a heavier load and jammed that\nin the switchbox.\n  \n \n  I flipped my machine into service once again. The lights flickered and\nheld.\n  \n \n  The dials on my control board told me the story. It was hard to take.\n  \n \n  But there it was.\n  \n \n  The internal Scale showed zero.\n  \n \n  I had had a slightly hot bar of silver alloy inside. It was completely\ngone. Mass zero. The temperature gauge showed that there had been\nno change in centigrade reading that couldn't be explained by the\nmechanical operation of the machine itself. There had been no sudden\ndischarge of electricity or radioactivity. I checked for a standard\nanti-gravity effect but there was none. Gravity inside the cylinder had\ngone to zero but never to minus.\n  \n \n  I was at last violating conservation of energy\u2014not by successfully\ninverting the cube of the ionization factor, but by destroying mass ...\nby simply making it cease to exist with no cause-and-effect side\neffects.\n  \n \n  I knew the government wouldn't be interested, since I couldn't explain\nhow my device worked. No amount of successful demonstration could ever\nconvince anybody with any scientific training that it actually did work.\n  \n \n  But I shrewdly judged that Tony Carmen wouldn't ask an embarrassing\n\"how\" when he was incapable of understanding the explanation.\n  \n<doc-sep>I peeled off my wet shirt and threw it across the corner of my desk,\ncasting a reproving eye at the pastel air-conditioner in the window. It\nwasn't really the machine's fault\u2014The water department reported the\nreservoir too low to run water-cooled systems. It would be a day or two\nbefore I could get the gas type into my office.\n  \n \n  Miss Brown, my secretary, was getting a good look at my pale, bony\nchest. Well, for the salary she got, she could stand to look. Of\ncourse, she herself was wearing a modest one-strap sun dress, not\nshorts and halters like some of the girls.\n  \n \n  \"My,\" she observed \"it certainly is humid for March, isn't it,\nProfessor Venetti?\"\n  \n \n  I agreed that it was.\n  \n \n  She got her pad and pencil ready.\n  \n \n  \"Wheedling form letter to Better Mousetraps. Where are our royalties\nfor the last quarter of the year? We know we didn't have a full three\nmonths with our Expendable Field in operation on the new traps, but we\nwant the payola for what we have coming.\n  \n \n  \"Condescending form letter to Humane Lethal Equipment. Absolutely do\nnot send the California penal system any chambers equipped with our\npatented field until legislature officially approves them.

Small children and appliances have\nalways been a problem, viz ice boxes and refrigerators. Suggest you put\na more complicated latch on the handles of the dangerously inferior\ndoors you have covering our efficient, patented field.\"\n  \n \n  I leaned back and took a breather. There was no getting around it\u2014I\njust wasn't happy as a business man. I had been counting on being only\na figurehead in the Expendable Patent Holding Corporation, but Tony\nCarmen didn't like office work. And he hadn't anyone he trusted any\nmore than me. Even.\n  \n \n  I jerked open a drawer and pulled off a paper towel from the roll I\nhad stolen in the men's room. Scrubbing my chest and neck with it, I\nsmoothed it out and dropped it into the wastebasket. It slid down the\ntapering sides and through the narrow slot above the Expendable Field.\nI had redesigned the wastebaskets after a janitor had stepped in one.\nBut Gimpy was happy now, with the $50,000 we paid him.\n  \n \n  I opened my mouth and Miss Brown's pencil perked up its eraser,\nreflecting her fierce alertness.\n  \n \n  Tony Carmen banged open the door, and I closed my mouth.\n  \n \n  \"G-men on the way here,\" he blurted and collapsed into a chair opposite\nMiss Brown.\n  \n \n  \"Don't revert to type,\" I warned him. \"What kind of G-Men? FBI? FCC?\nCIA? FDA? USTD?\"\n  \n \n  \"Investigators for the Atomic Energy Commission.\"\n  \n \n  The solemn, conservatively dressed young man in the door touched the\nedge of his snap-brim hat as he said it.\n  \n \n  \"Miss Brown, would you mind letting our visitor use your chair?\" I\nasked.\n  \n \n  \"Not at all, sir,\" she said dreamily.\n  \n \n  \"May I suggest,\" I said, \"that we might get more business done if you\nthen removed yourself from the chair first.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Brown leaped to her feet with a healthy galvanic response and quit\nthe vicinity with her usual efficiency.\n  \n"

        "\n  There\n  was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the\ntiny microphone on the outside of his\nsuit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go\nthrough his body. Then it seemed as if a\nhalf dozen hands were inside him, examining\nhis internal organs. His stomach contracted.\nHe felt a squeeze on his heart. His\nlungs tickled.\n  \n \n  There were several more queer motions\ninside his body.\n  \n \n  Then another Steel-Blue voice said:\n  \n \n  \"He is a soft-metal creature, made up of\nmetals that melt at a very low temperature.\nHe also contains a liquid whose makeup I\ncannot ascertain by ray-probe. Bring him\nback when the torture is done.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What\nkind of torture could this be?\n  \n \n  Would it last 21 days? He glanced at the\nchronometer on his wrist.\n  \n \n  Jon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien\nship and halted expectantly just outside the\nship's lock.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the\nstubray pistol holstered at his hip. Shoot my\nway out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he\ntoted up the disadvantages.\n  \n \n  He either would have to find a hiding\nplace on the asteroid, and if the Steel-Blues\nwanted him bad enough they could tear the\nwhole place to pieces, or somehow get\naboard the little life ship hidden in the\nservice station.\n  \n \n  In that he would be just a sitting duck.\n  \n \n  He shrugged off the slight temptation to\nuse the pistol. He was still curious.\n  \n \n  And he was interested in staying alive as\nlong as possible. There was a remote chance\nhe might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously,\nhe glanced toward his belt to see the little\npower pack which, if under ideal conditions,\ncould finger out fifty thousand miles into\nspace.\n  \n \n  If he could somehow stay alive the 21\ndays he might be able to warn the patrol.\nHe couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for\nhis life would be snuffed out immediately.\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue said quietly:\n  \n \n  \"It might be ironical to let you warn\nthat SP ship you keep thinking about. But\nwe know your weapon now. Already our\nship is equipped with a force field designed\nespecially to deflect your atomic guns.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts\nquickly. They can delve deeper than the\nsurface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a\nleash on my thoughts?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blue chuckled. \"You get\u2014absent-minded,\nis it?\u2014every once in a\nwhile.\"\n  \n \n  Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared\nlugging great sheets of plastic and various\nother equipment.\n  \n \n  They dumped their loads and began unbundling\nthem.\n  \n \n  Working swiftly, they built a plastic\nigloo, smaller than the living room in the\nlarger service station igloo. They ranged instruments\ninside\u2014one of them Jon Karyl\nrecognized as an air pump from within the\nstation\u2014and they laid out a pallet.\n  \n \n  When they were done Jon saw a miniature\nreproduction of the service station, lacking\nonly the cannon cap and fin, and with clear\nplastic walls instead of the opaqueness of the\nother.\n  \n \n  His Steel-Blue said: \"We have reproduced\nthe atmosphere of your station so that you\nbe watched while you undergo the torture\nunder the normal conditions of your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is this torture?\" Jon Karyl asked.\n  \n \n  The answer was almost caressing: \"It is\na liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes\njoints to harden if even so much as a drop\nremains on it long. It eats away the metal,\nleaving a scaly residue which crumbles\neventually into dust.\n  \n \n  \"We will dilute it with a harmless liquid\nfor you since No. 1 does not wish you to die\ninstantly.\n  \n \n  \"Enter your\"\u2014the Steel-Blue hesitated\u2014\"mausoleum.\nYou die in your own atmosphere.\nHowever, we took the liberty of purifying\nit. There were dangerous elements in\nit.\"\n  \n \n  Jon walked into the little igloo. The\nSteel-Blues sealed the lock, fingered dials\nand switches on the outside. Jon's space suit\ndeflated. Pressure was building up in the\nigloo.\n  \n \n  He took a sample of the air, found that\nit was good, although quite rich in oxygen\ncompared with what he'd been using in the\nservice station and in his suit.\n  \n \n  With a sigh of relief he took off his helmet\nand gulped huge draughts of the air.\n  \n \n  He sat down on the pallet and waited\nfor the torture to begin.\n  \n \n  The Steel Blues crowded about the igloo,\nstaring at him through elliptical eyes.\n  \n \n  Apparently, they too, were waiting for the\ntorture to begin.\n  \n \n  Jon thought the excess of oxygen was\nmaking him light-headed.\n  \n \n  He stared at a cylinder which was beginning\nto sprout tentacles from the circle.\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked again. An\nopening, like the adjustable eye-piece of a\nspacescope, was appearing in the center of\nthe cylinder.\n  \n \n  A square, glass-like tumbler sat in the\nopening disclosed in the four-foot cylinder\nthat had sprouted tentacles. It contained a\nyellowish liquid.\n  \n \n  One of the tentacles reached into the\nopening and clasped the glass. The opening\nclosed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor\nappendages, moved toward Jon.\n  \n \n  He didn't like the looks of the liquid in\nthe tumbler. It looked like an acid of some\nsort. He raised to his feet.\n  \n \n  He unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared\nto blast the cylinder.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\n  Jon\n  followed him through the sundered\nlock of the station. Karyl stopped for a\nmoment to examine the wreckage of the\nlock. It had been punched full of holes as\nif it had been some soft cheese instead of a\nmetal which Earthmen had spent nearly a\ncentury perfecting.\n  \n \n  \"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue\nsaid. \"But that metal also is found on\nour world. It's probably the softest and most\nmalleable we have. We were surprised you\u2014earthmen,\nis it?\u2014use it as protective\nmetal.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why are you in this system?\" Jon asked,\nhardly expecting an answer.\n  \n \n  It came anyway. \"For the same reason you\nEarthmen are reaching out farther into your\nsystem. We need living room. You have\nstrategically placed planets for our use. We\nwill use them.\"\n  \n \n  Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had\nbeen preaching preparedness as Earth flung\nher ships into the reaches of the solar system,\ntaking the first long step toward the\nconquest of space.\n  \n \n  There are other races somewhere, they\nargued. As strong and smart as man, many\nof them so transcending man in mental and\ninventive power that we must be prepared to\nstrike the minute danger shows.\n  \n \n  Now here was the answer to the scientists'\nwarning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.\n  \n \n  \"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue.\n\"I couldn't understand.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered.\nIt was a welcome surprise. Apparently his\nthoughts had to be directed outward, rather\nthan inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to\nread it.\n  \n \n  He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping\nlock of the invaders' space ship wondering\nhow he could warn Earth. The Space\nPatrol cruiser was due in for refueling at\nhis service station in 21 days. But by that\ntime he probably would be mouldering in\nthe rocky dust of the asteroid.\n  \n \n  It was pitch dark within the ship but the\nSteel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all\nmaneuvering through the maze of corridors.\nJon followed him, attached to one tentacle.\n  \n \n  Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular\nroom, bright with light streaming from\na glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently\nwere near topside of the vessel.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue, more massive than his\nguide and with four more pair of tentacles,\nincluding two short ones that grew from the\ntop of its head, spoke out.\n  \n \n  \"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue\nnodded.\n  \n \n  \"You know the penalty? Carry it out.\"\n  \n \n  \"He also is an inhabitant of this system,\"\nJon's guide added.\n  \n \n  \"Examine him first, then give him the\ndeath.\"\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl shrugged as he was led from\nthe lighted room through more corridors.\nIf it got too bad he still had the stubray\npistol.\n  \n \n  Anyway, he was curious. He'd taken on\nthe lonely, nerve-wracking job of service\nstation attendant just to see what it offered.\n  \n \n  Here was a part of it, and it was certainly\nsomething new.\n  \n \n  \"This is the examination room,\" his\nSteel-Blue said, almost contemptuously.\n  \n \n  A green effulgence surrounded him.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>\n  There\n  , just ahead of him, was the lock\nleading into the service station. Slipping\na key out of a leg pouch on the space suit,\nhe jabbed it into the center of the lock,\nopening the lever housing.\n  \n \n  He pulled strongly on the lever. With a\nhiss of escaping air, the lock swung open.\nJon Karyl darted inside, the door closing\nsoftly behind.\n  \n \n  At the end of the long tunnel he stepped\nto the televisor which was fixed on the area\nsurrounding the station.\n  \n \n  Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures.\nBut he saw their ship. It squatted\nlike a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut\ntight.\n  \n \n  He tuned the televisor to its widest range\nand finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.\nHe was looking into the stationary rocket\nengine.\n  \n \n  As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue\ncame crawling out of the ship.\n  \n \n  The two Steel-Blues moved toward the\ncenter of the televisor range. They're coming\ntoward the station, Karyl thought grimly.\n  \n \n  Karyl examined the two creatures. They\nwere of the steel-blue color from the crown\nof their egg-shaped heads to the tips of\ntheir walking appendages.\n  \n \n  They were about the height of Karyl\u2014six\nfeet. But where he tapered from broad\nshoulders to flat hips, they were straight up\nand down. They had no legs, just appendages,\nmany-jointed that stretched and\nshrank independent of the other, but keeping\nthe cylindrical body with its four pairs\nof tentacles on a level balance.\n  \n \n  Where their eyes would have been was\nan elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the\negg-head, with its converging ends curving\naround the sides of the head.\n  \n \n  Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But\nwhere were their masters?\n  \n \n  The Steel-Blues moved out of the range\nof the televisor. A minute later Jon heard\na pounding from the station upstairs.\n  \n \n  He chuckled. They were like the wolf of\npre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to\nblow the house down.\n  \n \n  The outer shell of the station was formed\nfrom stelrylite, the toughest metal in the\nsolar system. With the self-sealing lock of\nthe same resistant material, a mere pounding\nwas nothing.\n  \n \n  Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway.\nHe went up the steel ladder leading to the\nstation's power plant and the televisor that\ncould look into every room within the\nstation.\n  \n \n  He heaved a slight sigh when he reached\nthe power room, for right at his hand were\nweapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.\n  \n \n  Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the\nlock to the station. His teeth suddenly\nclamped down on his lower lip.\n  \n \n  Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes\ninto the stelrylite with round-headed metal\nclubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't\nbreak up that easily.\n  \n \n  Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up\nthe revolving turret which capped the station\nso that its thin fin pointed at the\nsquat ship of the invaders.\n  \n \n  Then he went to the atomic cannon's\nfiring buttons.\n  \n \n  He pressed first the yellow, then the blue\nbutton. Finally the red one.\n  \n \n  The thin fin\u2014the cannon's sight\u2014split in\nhalf as the turret opened and the coiled nose\nof the cannon protruded. There was a\nsoundless flash. Then a sharp crack.\n  \n \n  Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the\nbolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship\nof the solar system. There was nothing that\ncould withstand even the slight jolt of power\ngiven by the station cannon on any of the\nSun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of\nthe ship had changed. A bubble of metal,\nlike a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off\nthe vessel and struck the rocket of the\nasteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n  \n \n  He pressed the red button again.\n  \n \n  Then abruptly he was on the floor of the\npower room, his legs strangely cut out from\nunder him. He tried to move them. They lay\nflaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried\nto lever himself to an upright position.\n  \n \n  Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed\nfrom the waist down. But it couldn't\nhappen that suddenly.\n  \n \n  He turned his head.\n  \n \n  A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked\ntentacle held a square black box.\n  \n \n  Jon could read nothing in that metallic\nface. He said, voice muffled by the confines\nof the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am\"\u2014there was a rising inflection in\nthe answer\u2014\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n  \n \n  There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's\nface to move. \"That is what I have named\nyou,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"A robot,\" came the immediate answer.\nJon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue\nwas telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered.\n\"We talk in the language of the\nmind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning\nwith the square black box.\n  \n \n  The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed\nthe Steel-Blue, aware that the lens\nhe'd seen on the creature's face had a\ncounterpart on the back of the egg-head.\n  \n \n  Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.\nThat's quite an innovation. \"Thank you,\"\nSteel-Blue said.\n  \n \n  There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's\nmind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he\nhad applied for this high-paying but man-killing\njob as a Lone Watcher on the Solar\nSystem's starways.\n  \n \n  He had little fear now, only curiosity.\nThese Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.\nThey could have snuffed out my life very\nsimply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be\nfriends.\n  \n \n  Steel-Blue chuckled.\n  \n \n"

Two men helped\nhim to the back of the bus, dumped\nhim on the rear seat, and tucked his\ngin bottle safely out of sight. After\nall, he had not seen Earth for nine\nmonths, and judging by the crusted\nmatter about his eyelids, he couldn't\nhave seen it too well now, even if\nhe had been sober. Glare-blindness,\ngravity-legs, and agoraphobia were\nexcuses for a lot of things, when a\nman was just back from Big Bottomless.\nAnd who could blame a\nman for acting strangely?\n  \n \n  Minutes later, he was back up the\naisle and swaying giddily over the\nlittle housewife. \"How!\" he said.\n\"Me Chief Broken Wing. You\nwanta Indian wrestle?\"\n  \n \n  The girl, who sat nervously staring\nat him, smiled wanly, and\nshook her head.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet li'l pigeon, aren'tcha?\" he\nburbled affectionately, crashing into\nthe seat beside her.\n  \n \n  The two men slid out of their\nseats, and a hand clamped his shoulder.\n\"Come on, Broken Wing, let's\ngo back to bed.\"\n  \n \n  \"My name's Hogey,\" he said.\n\"Big Hogey Parker. I was just kidding\nabout being a Indian.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Come on, let's go have a\ndrink.\" They got him on his feet,\nand led him stumbling back down\nthe aisle.\n  \n \n  \"My ma was half Cherokee, see?\nThat's how come I said it. You\nwanta hear a war whoop? Real\nstuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind.\"\n  \n \n  He cupped his hands to his\nmouth and favored them with a\nblood-curdling proof of his ancestry,\nwhile the female passengers\nstirred restlessly and hunched in\ntheir seats. The driver stopped the\nbus and went back to warn him\nagainst any further display. The\ndriver flashed a deputy's badge and\nthreatened to turn him over to a\nconstable.\n  \n \n  \"I gotta get home,\" Big Hogey\ntold him. \"I got me a son now,\nthat's why. You know? A little\nbaby pigeon of a son. Haven't seen\nhim yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you just sit still and be\nquiet then, eh?\"\n  \n \n  Big Hogey nodded emphatically.\n\"Shorry, officer, I didn't mean to\nmake any trouble.\"\n  \n \n  When the bus started again, he\nfell on his side and lay still. He\nmade retching sounds for a time,\nthen rested, snoring softly. The bus\ndriver woke him again at Caine's\njunction, retrieved his gin bottle\nfrom behind the seat, and helped\nhim down the aisle and out of the\nbus.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey stumbled about for a\nmoment, then sat down hard in the\ngravel at the shoulder of the road.\nThe driver paused with one foot on\nthe step, looking around. There was\nnot even a store at the road junction,\nbut only a freight building\nnext to the railroad track, a couple\nof farmhouses at the edge of a side-road,\nand, just across the way, a deserted\nfilling station with a sagging\nroof. The land was Great Plains\ncountry, treeless, barren, and rolling.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey got up and staggered\naround in front of the bus, clutching\nat it for support, losing his\nduffle bag.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, watch the traffic!\" The\ndriver warned. With a surge of unwelcome\ncompassion he trotted\naround after his troublesome passenger,\ntaking his arm as he sagged\nagain. \"You crossing?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yah,\" Hogey muttered. \"Lemme\nalone, I'm okay.\"\n  \n \n  The driver started across the\nhighway with him. The traffic was\nsparse, but fast and dangerous in\nthe central ninety-mile lane.\n  \n \n  \"I'm okay,\" Hogey kept protesting.\n\"I'm a tumbler, ya know?\nGravity's got me. Damn gravity.\nI'm not used to gravity, ya know? I\nused to be a tumbler\u2014\n   \n   huk!\n   \n  \u2014only\nnow I gotta be a hoofer. 'Count\nof li'l Hogey.

Man oughta stick with\nhis family. You oughta get another\njob.\" Hogey eyed him owlishly,\nwaggled a moralistic finger, skidded\non the gravel as they stepped\nonto the opposite shoulder, and\nsprawled again.\n  \n \n  The driver blew a weary breath,\nlooked down at him, and shook his\nhead. Maybe it'd be kinder to find\na constable after all. This guy could\nget himself killed, wandering\naround loose.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody supposed to meet\nyou?\" he asked, squinting around\nat the dusty hills.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Huk!\n   \n  \u2014who, me?\" Hogey giggled,\nbelched, and shook his head.\n\"Nope. Nobody knows I'm coming.\nS'prise. I'm supposed to be here a\nweek ago.\" He looked up at the\ndriver with a pained expression.\n\"Week late, ya know?

You know\nwhere? 'Bout three miles from\nhere. Gotta walk, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" the driver warned.\n\"You sit there by the culvert till\nyou get a ride. Okay?\"\n  \n \n  Hogey nodded forlornly.\n  \n \n  \"Now stay out of the road,\" the\ndriver warned, then hurried back\nacross the highway. Moments later,\nthe atomic battery-driven motors\ndroned mournfully, and the bus\npulled away.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey blinked after it, rubbing\nthe back of his neck. \"Nice\npeople,\" he said. \"Nice buncha people.\nAll hoofers.\"\n  \n \n  With a grunt and a lurch, he got\nto his feet, but his legs wouldn't\nwork right. With his tumbler's reflexes,\nhe fought to right himself\nwith frantic arm motions, but gravity\nclaimed him, and he went stumbling\ninto the ditch.\n  \n \n  \"Damn legs, damn crazy legs!\"\nhe cried.\n  \n \n  The bottom of the ditch was wet,\nand he crawled up the embankment\nwith mud-soaked knees, and sat on\nthe shoulder again. The gin bottle\nwas still intact. He had himself a\nlong fiery drink, and it warmed him\ndeep down. He blinked around at\nthe gaunt and treeless land.\n  \n \n  The sun was almost down, forge-red\non a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked\nsky faded into sulphurous\nyellow toward the zenith, and the\nvery air that hung over the land\nseemed full of yellow smoke, the\nomnipresent dust of the plains.\n  \n \n  A farm truck turned onto the\nside-road and moaned away, its\ndriver hardly glancing at the dark\nyoung man who sat swaying on his\nduffle bag near the culvert. Hogey\nscarcely noticed the vehicle. He just\nkept staring at the crazy sun.\n  \n \n  He shook his head. It wasn't really\nthe sun. The sun, the real sun,\nwas a hateful eye-sizzling horror in\nthe dead black pit. It painted everything\nwith pure white pain, and you\nsaw things by the reflected pain-light.\nThe fat red sun was strictly a\nphoney, and it didn't fool him any.\nHe hated it for what he knew it was\nbehind the gory mask, and for what\nit had done to his eyes.\n  \n \n \n  With a grunt, he got to his feet,\nmanaged to shoulder the duffle bag,\nand started off down the middle of\nthe farm road, lurching from side\nto side, and keeping his eyes on the\nrolling distances. Another car turned\nonto the side-road, honking angrily.\n  \n \n  Hogey tried to turn around to\nlook at it, but he forgot to shift his\nfooting. He staggered and went\ndown on the pavement. The car's\ntires screeched on the hot asphalt.\nHogey lay there for a moment,\ngroaning. That one had hurt his\nhip. A car door slammed and a big\nman with a florid face got out and\nstalked toward him, looking angry.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell's the matter with\nyou, fella?\" he drawled. \"You\nsoused? Man, you've really got a\nload.\"\n  \n \n  Hogey got up doggedly, shaking\nhis head to clear it. \"Space legs,\" he\nprevaricated. \"Got space legs. Can't\nstand the gravity.\"\n  \n \n  The burly farmer retrieved his\ngin bottle for him, still miraculously\nunbroken. \"Here's your gravity,\"\nhe grunted. \"Listen, fella, you better\nget home pronto.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pronto? Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest,\nI'm just space burned. You\nknow?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Say, who are you, anyway?\nDo you live around here?\"\n  \n \n  It was obvious that the big man\nhad taken him for a hobo or a\ntramp. Hogey pulled himself together.\n\"Goin' to the Hauptman's\nplace. Marie. You know Marie?\"\n  \n \n  The farmer's eyebrows went up.\n\"Marie Hauptman? Sure I know\nher. Only she's Marie Parker now.\nHas been, nigh on six years. Say\u2014\"\nHe paused, then gaped. \"You ain't\nher husband by any chance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogey, that's me. Big Hogey\nParker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I'll be\u2014! Get in the car.\nI'm going right past John Hauptman's\nplace. Boy, you're in no\nshape to walk it.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly, waggled his\nhead, and helped Hogey and his\nbag into the back seat. A woman\nwith a sun-wrinkled neck sat rigidly\nbeside the farmer in the front,\nand she neither greeted the passenger\nnor looked around.\n  \n \n  \"They don't make cars like this\nanymore,\" the farmer called over\nthe growl of the ancient gasoline\nengine and the grind of gears.\n\"You can have them new atomics\nwith their loads of hot isotopes\nunder the seat. Ain't safe, I say\u2014eh,\nMartha?\"\n  \n \n  The woman with the sun-baked\nneck quivered her head slightly.\n\"A car like this was good enough\nfor Pa, an' I reckon it's good\nenough for us,\" she drawled mournfully.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the car drew\nin to the side of the road. \"Reckon\nyou can walk it from here,\" the\nfarmer said. \"That's Hauptman's\nroad just up ahead.\"\n  \n \n  He helped Hogey out of the car\nand drove away without looking\nback to see if Hogey stayed on his\nfeet. The woman with the sun-baked\nneck was suddenly talking\ngarrulously in his direction.\n  \n \n  It was twilight. The sun had set,\nand the yellow sky was turning\ngray. Hogey was too tired to go on,\nand his legs would no longer hold\nhim. He blinked around at the land,\ngot his eyes focused, and found\nwhat looked like Hauptman's place\non a distant hillside. It was a big\nframe house surrounded by a wheatfield,\nand a few scrawny trees. Having\nlocated it, he stretched out in\nthe tall grass beyond the ditch to\ntake a little rest.\n  \n \n  Somewhere dogs were barking,\nand a cricket sang creaking monotony\nin the grass. Once there was the\ndistant thunder of a rocket blast\nfrom the launching station six miles\nto the west, but it faded quickly. An\nA-motored convertible whined past\non the road, but Hogey went unseen.\n  \n \n  When he awoke, it was night,\nand he was shivering. His stomach\nwas screeching, and his nerves dancing\nwith high voltages. He sat up\nand groped for his watch, then remembered\nhe had pawned it after\nthe poker game. Remembering the\ngame and the results of the game\nmade him wince and bite his lip\nand grope for the bottle again.\n  \n \n  He sat breathing heavily for a\nmoment after the stiff drink. Equating\ntime to position had become\nsecond nature with him, but he had\nto think for a moment because his\ndefective vision prevented him from\nseeing the Earth-crescent.\n  \n \n  Vega was almost straight above\nhim in the late August sky, so he\nknew it wasn't much after sundown\u2014probably\nabout eight o'clock. He\nbraced himself with another swallow\nof gin, picked himself up and\ngot back to the road, feeling a little\nsobered after the nap.\n  \n \n  He limped on up the pavement\nand turned left at the narrow drive\nthat led between barbed-wire fences\ntoward the Hauptman farmhouse,\nfive hundred yards or so from the\nfarm road. The fields on his left\nbelonged to Marie's father, he\nknew. He was getting close\u2014close\nto home and woman and child.\n  \n \n  He dropped the bag suddenly\nand leaned against a fence post,\nrolling his head on his forearms\nand choking in spasms of air. He\nwas shaking all over, and his belly\nwrithed. He wanted to turn and\nrun. He wanted to crawl out in the\ngrass and hide.\n  \n \n  What were they going to say?\nAnd Marie, Marie most of all.\nHow was he going to tell her about\nthe money?\n  \n \n  Six hitches in space, and every\ntime the promise had been the\nsame:\n   \n   One more tour, baby, and\nwe'll have enough dough, and then\nI'll quit for good. One more time,\nand we'll have our stake\u2014enough\nto open a little business, or buy a\nhouse with a mortgage and get a\njob.\n   \n \n \n  And she had waited, but the\nmoney had never been quite enough\nuntil this time.",
        " This time the tour\nhad lasted nine months, and he had\nsigned on for every run from station\nto moon-base to pick up the\nbonuses. And this time he'd made\nit. Two weeks ago, there had been\nforty-eight hundred in the bank.\nAnd now ...\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \" he groaned, striking his\nforehead against his forearms. His\narm slipped, and his head hit the\ntop of the fencepost, and the pain\nblinded him for a moment. He staggered\nback into the road with a\nlow roar, wiped blood from his\nforehead, and savagely kicked his\nbag.\n  \n \n  It rolled a couple of yards up the\nroad. He leaped after it and kicked\nit again. When he had finished\nwith it, he stood panting and angry,\nbut feeling better. He shouldered\nthe bag and hiked on toward the\nfarmhouse.\n  \n \n  They're hoofers, that's all\u2014just\nan Earth-chained bunch of hoofers,\neven Marie. And I'm a tumbler. A\nborn tumbler. Know what that\nmeans? It means\u2014God, what does\nit mean? It means out in Big Bottomless,\nwhere Earth's like a fat\nmoon with fuzzy mold growing on\nit. Mold, that's all you are, just\nmold.\n  \n \n  A dog barked, and he wondered\nif he had been muttering aloud. He\ncame to a fence-gap and paused in\nthe darkness. The road wound\naround and came up the hill in\nfront of the house. Maybe they were\nsitting on the porch. Maybe they'd\nalready heard him coming. Maybe ...\n  \n \n  He was trembling again. He\nfished the fifth of gin out of his\ncoat pocket and sloshed it. Still over\nhalf a pint. He decided to kill it. It\nwouldn't do to go home with a\nbottle sticking out of his pocket.\nHe stood there in the night wind,\nsipping at it, and watching the reddish\nmoon come up in the east. The\nmoon looked as phoney as the\nsetting sun.\n  \n \n  He straightened in sudden determination.\nIt had to be sometime.\nGet it over with, get it over with\nnow. He opened the fence-gap, slipped\nthrough, and closed it firmly\nbehind him. He retrieved his bag,\nand waded quietly through the tall\ngrass until he reached the hedge\nwhich divided an area of sickly\npeach trees from the field. He got\nover the hedge somehow, and started\nthrough the trees toward the\nhouse. He stumbled over some old\nboards, and they clattered.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Shhh!\n   \n  \" he hissed, and moved\non.\n  \n \n  The dogs were barking angrily,\nand he heard a screen door slam.\nHe stopped.\n  \n \n  \"Ho there!\" a male voice called\nexperimentally from the house.\n  \n \n  One of Marie's brothers. Hogey\nstood frozen in the shadow of a\npeach tree, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Anybody out there?\" the man\ncalled again.\n  \n \n  Hogey waited, then heard the\nman muttering, \"Sic 'im, boy, sic\n'im.\"\n  \n \n  The hound's bark became eager.\nThe animal came chasing down the\nslope, and stopped ten feet away to\ncrouch and bark frantically at the\nshadow in the gloom. He knew the\ndog.\n  \n \n  \"Hooky!\" he whispered. \"Hooky\nboy\u2014here!\"\n  \n \n  The dog stopped barking, sniffed,\ntrotted closer, and went\n\"\n   \n   Rrrooff!\n   \n  \" Then he started sniffing\nsuspiciously again.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Hooky, here boy!\" he\nwhispered.\n  \n \n  The dog came forward silently,\nsniffed his hand, and whined in\nrecognition. Then he trotted around\nHogey, panting doggy affection and\ndancing an invitation to romp. The\nman whistled from the porch. The\ndog froze, then trotted quickly back\nup the slope.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing, eh, Hooky?\" the\nman on the porch said. \"Chasin'\narmadillos again, eh?\"\n  \n \n  The screen door slammed again,\nand the porch light went out.\nHogey stood there staring, unable\nto think. Somewhere beyond the\nwindow lights were\u2014his woman,\nhis son.\n  \n \n  What the hell was a tumbler doing\nwith a woman and a son?\n  \n \n  After perhaps a minute, he stepped\nforward again. He tripped over\na shovel, and his foot plunged into\nsomething that went\n   \n   squelch\n   \n  and\nswallowed the foot past the ankle.\nHe fell forward into a heap of\nsand, and his foot went deeper into\nthe sloppy wetness.\n  \n \n  He lay there with his stinging\nforehead on his arms, cursing softly\nand crying. Finally he rolled\nover, pulled his foot out of the\nmess, and took off his shoes. They\nwere full of mud\u2014sticky sandy\nmud.\n  \n \n  The dark world was reeling\nabout him, and the wind was dragging\nat his breath. He fell back\nagainst the sand pile and let his\nfeet sink in the mud hole and wriggled\nhis toes. He was laughing\nsoundlessly, and his face was wet\nin the wind. He couldn't think. He\ncouldn't remember where he was\nand why, and he stopped caring,\nand after a while he felt better.\n  \n \n  The stars were swimming over\nhim, dancing crazily, and the mud\ncooled his feet, and the sand was\nsoft behind him. He saw a rocket\ngo up on a tail of flame from the\nstation, and waited for the sound of\nits blast, but he was already asleep\nwhen it came.\n  \n \n  It was far past midnight when he\nbecame conscious of the dog licking\nwetly at his ear and cheek. He\npushed the animal away with a low\ncurse and mopped at the side of his\nface. He stirred, and groaned. His\nfeet were burning up! He tried to\npull them toward him, but they\nwouldn't budge. There was something\nwrong with his legs.\n  \n \n  For an instant he stared wildly\naround in the night. Then he remembered\nwhere he was, closed his\neyes and shuddered. When he\nopened them again, the moon had\nemerged from behind a cloud, and\nhe could see clearly the cruel trap\ninto which he had accidentally\nstumbled. A pile of old boards, a\ncareful stack of new lumber, a\npick and shovel, a sand-pile, heaps\nof fresh-turned earth, and a concrete\nmixer\u2014well, it added up.\n  \n \n  He gripped his ankles and pulled,\nbut his feet wouldn't budge. In\nsudden terror, he tried to stand up,\nbut his ankles were clutched by the\nconcrete too, and he fell back in\nthe sand with a low moan. He lay\nstill for several minutes, considering\ncarefully.\n  \n \n  He pulled at his left foot. It was\nlocked in a vise. He tugged even\nmore desperately at his right foot.\nIt was equally immovable.\n  \n \n  He sat up with a whimper and\nclawed at the rough concrete until\nhis nails tore and his fingertips\nbled. The surface still felt damp,\nbut it had hardened while he slept.\n  \n \n  He sat there stunned until Hooky\nbegan licking at his scuffed fingers.\nHe shouldered the dog away, and\ndug his hands into the sand-pile to\nstop the bleeding. Hooky licked at\nhis face, panting love.\n  \n \n  \"Get away!\" he croaked savagely.\n  \n \n  The dog whined softly, trotted\na short distance away, circled, and\ncame back to crouch down in the\nsand directly before Hogey, inching\nforward experimentally.\n  \n \n  Hogey gripped fistfuls of the dry\nsand and cursed between his teeth,\nwhile his eyes wandered over the\nsky. They came to rest on the sliver\nof light\u2014the space station\u2014rising\nin the west, floating out in Big Bottomless\nwhere the gang was\u2014Nichols\nand Guerrera and Lavrenti\nand Fats. And he wasn't forgetting\nKeesey, the rookie who'd replaced\nhim.\n  \n \n  Keesey would have a rough time\nfor a while\u2014rough as a cob. The pit\nwas no playground. The first time\nyou went out of the station in a\nsuit, the pit got you. Everything\nwas falling, and you fell, with it.\nEverything. The skeletons of steel,\nthe tire-shaped station, the spheres\nand docks and nightmare shapes\u2014all\ntied together by umbilical cables\nand flexible tubes. Like some crazy\nsea-thing they seemed, floating in a\nblack ocean with its tentacles bound\ntogether by drifting strands in the\ndark tide that bore it.\n  \n \n \n  Everything was pain-bright or\ndead black, and it wheeled around\nyou, and you went nuts trying to\nfigure which way was down. In fact,\nit took you months to teach your\nbody that\n   \n   all\n   \n  ways were down and\nthat the pit was bottomless.\n  \n \n  He became conscious of a plaintive\nsound in the wind, and froze to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  It was a baby crying.\n  \n \n  It was nearly a minute before he\ngot the significance of it. It hit him\nwhere he lived, and he began jerking\nfrantically at his encased feet\nand sobbing low in his throat.\nThey'd hear him if he kept that up.\nHe stopped and covered his ears to\nclose out the cry of his firstborn. A\nlight went on in the house, and\nwhen it went off again, the infant's\ncry had ceased.\n  \n \n  Another rocket went up from the\nstation, and he cursed it. Space was\na disease, and he had it.\n  \n \n  \"Help!\" he cried out suddenly.\n\"I'm stuck! Help me, help me!\"\n  \n \n  He knew he was yelling hysterically\nat the sky and fighting the relentless\nconcrete that clutched his\nfeet, and after a moment he stopped.\n  \n \n  The light was on in the house\nagain, and he heard faint sounds.\nThe stirring-about woke the baby\nagain, and once more the infant's\nwail came on the breeze.\n  \n \n \n   Make the kid shut up, make the\nkid shut up ...\n   \n \n \n  But that was no good. It wasn't\nthe kid's fault. It wasn't Marie's\nfault. No fathers allowed in space,\nthey said, but it wasn't their fault\neither. They were right, and he had\nonly himself to blame. The kid was\nan accident, but that didn't change\nanything. Not a thing in the world.\nIt remained a tragedy.\n  \n \n  A tumbler had no business with a\nfamily, but what was a man going\nto do? Take a skinning knife, boy,\nand make yourself a eunuch. But\nthat was no good either. They needed\nbulls out there in the pit, not\nsteers. And when a man came down\nfrom a year's hitch, what was he\ngoing to do? Live in a lonely shack\nand read books for kicks? Because\nyou were a man, you sought out a\nwoman. And because she was a\nwoman, she got a kid, and that was\nthe end of it. It was nobody's fault,\nnobody's at all.\n  \n \n  He stared at the red eye of Mars\nlow in the southwest. They were\nrunning out there now, and next\nyear he would have been on the\nlong long run ...\n  \n \n  But there was no use thinking\nabout it. Next year and the years\nafter belonged to\n   \n   little\n   \n  Hogey.\n  \n \n  He sat there with his feet locked\nin the solid concrete of the footing,\nstaring out into Big Bottomless\nwhile his son's cry came from the\nhouse and the Hauptman menfolk\ncame wading through the tall grass\nin search of someone who had cried\nout. His feet were stuck tight, and\nhe wouldn't ever get them out. He\nwas sobbing softly when they found\nhim.\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Fantastic Universe\n  \n September 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

It was then that he realized something\nunusual must have occurred. An orange patrol car of the security police\nwas parked at his front door. And something else was happening too.\n  \n \n  His house was dancing.\n  \n \n  It was disconcerting, and at the same time enchanting, to watch one's\nresidence frisking about on its foundation. It was such a strange sight\nthat for the moment he didn't give a thought to what might be causing\nit. But when he stepped gingerly onto the porch, which was doing its\nown independent gavotte, he reached for the doorknob with an immense\ncuriosity.\n  \n \n  The door flung itself open and knocked him back off the porch.\n  \n \n  From a prone position on his miniscule front lawn, Fownes watched as\nhis favorite easy chair sailed out of the living room on a blast of\ncold air and went pinwheeling down the avenue in the bright sunshine. A\nwild wind and a thick fog poured out of the house. It brought chairs,\nsuits, small tables, lamps trailing their cords, ashtrays, sofa\ncushions. The house was emptying itself fiercely, as if disgorging an\nold, spoiled meal. From deep inside he could hear the rumble of his\nancient upright piano as it rolled ponderously from room to room.\n  \n \n  He stood up; a wet wind swept over him, whipping at his face, toying\nwith his hair. It was a whistling in his ears, and a tingle on his\ncheeks. He got hit by a shoe.\n  \n \n  As he forced his way back to the doorway needles of rain played over\nhis face and he heard a voice cry out from somewhere in the living room.\n  \n \n  \"Help!\" Lieutenant MacBride called.\n  \n \n  Standing in the doorway with his wet hair plastered down on his\ndripping scalp, the wind roaring about him, the piano rumbling in the\ndistance like thunder, Humphrey Fownes suddenly saw it all very clearly.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Winds\n   \n  ,\" he said in a whisper.\n  \n \n  \"What's happening?\" MacBride yelled, crouching behind the sofa.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   March\n   \n  winds,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"What?!\"\n  \n \n  \"April showers!\"\n  \n \n  The winds roared for a moment and then MacBride's lost voice emerged\nfrom the blackness of the living room. \"These are\n   \n   not\n   \n  Optimum Dome\nConditions!\" the voice wailed. \"The temperature is\n   \n   not\n   \n  59 degrees.\nThe humidity is\n   \n   not\n   \n  47%!\"\n  \n"

        "\n  They all\n  knew he was a spacer\nbecause of the white goggle marks\non his sun-scorched face, and so\nthey tolerated him and helped him.\nThey even made allowances for him\nwhen he staggered and fell in the\naisle of the bus while pursuing the\nharassed little housewife from seat\nto seat and cajoling her to sit and\ntalk with him.\n  \n \n  Having fallen, he decided to\nsleep in the aisle. Two men helped\nhim to the back of the bus, dumped\nhim on the rear seat, and tucked his\ngin bottle safely out of sight. After\nall, he had not seen Earth for nine\nmonths, and judging by the crusted\nmatter about his eyelids, he couldn't\nhave seen it too well now, even if\nhe had been sober. Glare-blindness,\ngravity-legs, and agoraphobia were\nexcuses for a lot of things, when a\nman was just back from Big Bottomless.\nAnd who could blame a\nman for acting strangely?\n  \n \n  Minutes later, he was back up the\naisle and swaying giddily over the\nlittle housewife. \"How!\" he said.\n\"Me Chief Broken Wing. You\nwanta Indian wrestle?\"\n  \n \n  The girl, who sat nervously staring\nat him, smiled wanly, and\nshook her head.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet li'l pigeon, aren'tcha?\" he\nburbled affectionately, crashing into\nthe seat beside her.\n  \n \n  The two men slid out of their\nseats, and a hand clamped his shoulder.\n\"Come on, Broken Wing, let's\ngo back to bed.\"\n  \n \n  \"My name's Hogey,\" he said.\n\"Big Hogey Parker. I was just kidding\nabout being a Indian.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Come on, let's go have a\ndrink.\" They got him on his feet,\nand led him stumbling back down\nthe aisle.\n  \n \n  \"My ma was half Cherokee, see?\nThat's how come I said it. You\nwanta hear a war whoop? Real\nstuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind.\"\n  \n \n  He cupped his hands to his\nmouth and favored them with a\nblood-curdling proof of his ancestry,\nwhile the female passengers\nstirred restlessly and hunched in\ntheir seats. The driver stopped the\nbus and went back to warn him\nagainst any further display. The\ndriver flashed a deputy's badge and\nthreatened to turn him over to a\nconstable.\n  \n \n  \"I gotta get home,\" Big Hogey\ntold him. \"I got me a son now,\nthat's why. You know? A little\nbaby pigeon of a son. Haven't seen\nhim yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you just sit still and be\nquiet then, eh?\"\n  \n \n  Big Hogey nodded emphatically.\n\"Shorry, officer, I didn't mean to\nmake any trouble.\"\n  \n \n  When the bus started again, he\nfell on his side and lay still. He\nmade retching sounds for a time,\nthen rested, snoring softly. The bus\ndriver woke him again at Caine's\njunction, retrieved his gin bottle\nfrom behind the seat, and helped\nhim down the aisle and out of the\nbus.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey stumbled about for a\nmoment, then sat down hard in the\ngravel at the shoulder of the road.\nThe driver paused with one foot on\nthe step, looking around. There was\nnot even a store at the road junction,\nbut only a freight building\nnext to the railroad track, a couple\nof farmhouses at the edge of a side-road,\nand, just across the way, a deserted\nfilling station with a sagging\nroof. The land was Great Plains\ncountry, treeless, barren, and rolling.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey got up and staggered\naround in front of the bus, clutching\nat it for support, losing his\nduffle bag.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, watch the traffic!\" The\ndriver warned. With a surge of unwelcome\ncompassion he trotted\naround after his troublesome passenger,\ntaking his arm as he sagged\nagain. \"You crossing?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yah,\" Hogey muttered. \"Lemme\nalone, I'm okay.\"\n  \n \n  The driver started across the\nhighway with him. The traffic was\nsparse, but fast and dangerous in\nthe central ninety-mile lane.\n  \n \n  \"I'm okay,\" Hogey kept protesting.\n\"I'm a tumbler, ya know?\nGravity's got me. Damn gravity.\nI'm not used to gravity, ya know? I\nused to be a tumbler\u2014\n   \n   huk!\n   \n  \u2014only\nnow I gotta be a hoofer. 'Count\nof li'l Hogey.

You oughta get another\njob.\" Hogey eyed him owlishly,\nwaggled a moralistic finger, skidded\non the gravel as they stepped\nonto the opposite shoulder, and\nsprawled again.\n  \n \n  The driver blew a weary breath,\nlooked down at him, and shook his\nhead. Maybe it'd be kinder to find\na constable after all. This guy could\nget himself killed, wandering\naround loose.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody supposed to meet\nyou?\" he asked, squinting around\nat the dusty hills.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Huk!\n   \n  \u2014who, me?\" Hogey giggled,\nbelched, and shook his head.\n\"Nope. Nobody knows I'm coming.\nS'prise. I'm supposed to be here a\nweek ago.\" He looked up at the\ndriver with a pained expression.\n\"Week late, ya know? Marie's\ngonna be sore\u2014woo-\n   \n   hoo\n   \n  !\u2014is she\ngonna be sore!\" He waggled his\nhead severely at the ground.\n  \n \n  \"Which way are you going?\" the\ndriver grunted impatiently.\n  \n \n  Hogey pointed down the side-road\nthat led back into the hills.\n\"Marie's pop's place. You know\nwhere? 'Bout three miles from\nhere. Gotta walk, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" the driver warned.\n\"You sit there by the culvert till\nyou get a ride. Okay?\"\n  \n \n  Hogey nodded forlornly.\n  \n \n  \"Now stay out of the road,\" the\ndriver warned, then hurried back\nacross the highway. Moments later,\nthe atomic battery-driven motors\ndroned mournfully, and the bus\npulled away.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey blinked after it, rubbing\nthe back of his neck. \"Nice\npeople,\" he said. \"Nice buncha people.\nAll hoofers.\"\n  \n \n  With a grunt and a lurch, he got\nto his feet, but his legs wouldn't\nwork right. With his tumbler's reflexes,\nhe fought to right himself\nwith frantic arm motions, but gravity\nclaimed him, and he went stumbling\ninto the ditch.\n  \n \n  \"Damn legs, damn crazy legs!\"\nhe cried.\n  \n \n  The bottom of the ditch was wet,\nand he crawled up the embankment\nwith mud-soaked knees, and sat on\nthe shoulder again. The gin bottle\nwas still intact. He had himself a\nlong fiery drink, and it warmed him\ndeep down. He blinked around at\nthe gaunt and treeless land.\n  \n \n  The sun was almost down, forge-red\non a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked\nsky faded into sulphurous\nyellow toward the zenith, and the\nvery air that hung over the land\nseemed full of yellow smoke, the\nomnipresent dust of the plains.\n  \n \n  A farm truck turned onto the\nside-road and moaned away, its\ndriver hardly glancing at the dark\nyoung man who sat swaying on his\nduffle bag near the culvert. Hogey\nscarcely noticed the vehicle. He just\nkept staring at the crazy sun.\n  \n \n  He shook his head. It wasn't really\nthe sun. The sun, the real sun,\nwas a hateful eye-sizzling horror in\nthe dead black pit. It painted everything\nwith pure white pain, and you\nsaw things by the reflected pain-light.\nThe fat red sun was strictly a\nphoney, and it didn't fool him any.\nHe hated it for what he knew it was\nbehind the gory mask, and for what\nit had done to his eyes.\n  \n \n \n  With a grunt, he got to his feet,\nmanaged to shoulder the duffle bag,\nand started off down the middle of\nthe farm road, lurching from side\nto side, and keeping his eyes on the\nrolling distances. Another car turned\nonto the side-road, honking angrily.\n  \n \n  Hogey tried to turn around to\nlook at it, but he forgot to shift his\nfooting. He staggered and went\ndown on the pavement. The car's\ntires screeched on the hot asphalt.\nHogey lay there for a moment,\ngroaning. That one had hurt his\nhip. A car door slammed and a big\nman with a florid face got out and\nstalked toward him, looking angry.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell's the matter with\nyou, fella?\" he drawled. \"You\nsoused? Man, you've really got a\nload.\"\n  \n \n  Hogey got up doggedly, shaking\nhis head to clear it. \"Space legs,\" he\nprevaricated. \"Got space legs. Can't\nstand the gravity.\"\n  \n \n  The burly farmer retrieved his\ngin bottle for him, still miraculously\nunbroken. \"Here's your gravity,\"\nhe grunted. \"Listen, fella, you better\nget home pronto.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pronto? Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest,\nI'm just space burned. You\nknow?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Say, who are you, anyway?\nDo you live around here?\"\n  \n \n  It was obvious that the big man\nhad taken him for a hobo or a\ntramp. Hogey pulled himself together.\n\"Goin' to the Hauptman's\nplace. Marie. You know Marie?\"\n  \n \n  The farmer's eyebrows went up.\n\"Marie Hauptman? Sure I know\nher. Only she's Marie Parker now.\nHas been, nigh on six years. Say\u2014\"\nHe paused, then gaped. \"You ain't\nher husband by any chance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogey, that's me. Big Hogey\nParker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I'll be\u2014! Get in the car.\nI'm going right past John Hauptman's\nplace. Boy, you're in no\nshape to walk it.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly, waggled his\nhead, and helped Hogey and his\nbag into the back seat. A woman\nwith a sun-wrinkled neck sat rigidly\nbeside the farmer in the front,\nand she neither greeted the passenger\nnor looked around.\n  \n \n  \"They don't make cars like this\nanymore,\" the farmer called over\nthe growl of the ancient gasoline\nengine and the grind of gears.\n\"You can have them new atomics\nwith their loads of hot isotopes\nunder the seat. Ain't safe, I say\u2014eh,\nMartha?\"\n  \n \n  The woman with the sun-baked\nneck quivered her head slightly.\n\"A car like this was good enough\nfor Pa, an' I reckon it's good\nenough for us,\" she drawled mournfully.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the car drew\nin to the side of the road. \"Reckon\nyou can walk it from here,\" the\nfarmer said. \"That's Hauptman's\nroad just up ahead.\"\n  \n \n  He helped Hogey out of the car\nand drove away without looking\nback to see if Hogey stayed on his\nfeet. The woman with the sun-baked\nneck was suddenly talking\ngarrulously in his direction.\n  \n \n  It was twilight. The sun had set,\nand the yellow sky was turning\ngray. Hogey was too tired to go on,\nand his legs would no longer hold\nhim. He blinked around at the land,\ngot his eyes focused, and found\nwhat looked like Hauptman's place\non a distant hillside. It was a big\nframe house surrounded by a wheatfield,\nand a few scrawny trees. Having\nlocated it, he stretched out in\nthe tall grass beyond the ditch to\ntake a little rest.\n  \n \n  Somewhere dogs were barking,\nand a cricket sang creaking monotony\nin the grass. Once there was the\ndistant thunder of a rocket blast\nfrom the launching station six miles\nto the west, but it faded quickly. An\nA-motored convertible whined past\non the road, but Hogey went unseen.\n  \n \n  When he awoke, it was night,\nand he was shivering. His stomach\nwas screeching, and his nerves dancing\nwith high voltages. He sat up\nand groped for his watch, then remembered\nhe had pawned it after\nthe poker game. Remembering the\ngame and the results of the game\nmade him wince and bite his lip\nand grope for the bottle again.\n  \n \n  He sat breathing heavily for a\nmoment after the stiff drink. Equating\ntime to position had become\nsecond nature with him, but he had\nto think for a moment because his\ndefective vision prevented him from\nseeing the Earth-crescent.\n  \n \n  Vega was almost straight above\nhim in the late August sky, so he\nknew it wasn't much after sundown\u2014probably\nabout eight o'clock. He\nbraced himself with another swallow\nof gin, picked himself up and\ngot back to the road, feeling a little\nsobered after the nap.\n  \n \n  He limped on up the pavement\nand turned left at the narrow drive\nthat led between barbed-wire fences\ntoward the Hauptman farmhouse,\nfive hundred yards or so from the\nfarm road. The fields on his left\nbelonged to Marie's father, he\nknew. He was getting close\u2014close\nto home and woman and child.\n  \n \n  He dropped the bag suddenly\nand leaned against a fence post,\nrolling his head on his forearms\nand choking in spasms of air. He\nwas shaking all over, and his belly\nwrithed. He wanted to turn and\nrun. He wanted to crawl out in the\ngrass and hide.\n  \n \n  What were they going to say?\nAnd Marie, Marie most of all.\nHow was he going to tell her about\nthe money?\n  \n \n  Six hitches in space, and every\ntime the promise had been the\nsame:\n   \n   One more tour, baby, and\nwe'll have enough dough, and then\nI'll quit for good. One more time,\nand we'll have our stake\u2014enough\nto open a little business, or buy a\nhouse with a mortgage and get a\njob.\n   \n \n \n  And she had waited, but the\nmoney had never been quite enough\nuntil this time. This time the tour\nhad lasted nine months, and he had\nsigned on for every run from station\nto moon-base to pick up the\nbonuses. And this time he'd made\nit. Two weeks ago, there had been\nforty-eight hundred in the bank.\nAnd now ...\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \" he groaned, striking his\nforehead against his forearms. His\narm slipped, and his head hit the\ntop of the fencepost, and the pain\nblinded him for a moment. He staggered\nback into the road with a\nlow roar, wiped blood from his\nforehead, and savagely kicked his\nbag.\n  \n \n  It rolled a couple of yards up the\nroad. He leaped after it and kicked\nit again. When he had finished\nwith it, he stood panting and angry,\nbut feeling better. He shouldered\nthe bag and hiked on toward the\nfarmhouse.\n  \n \n  They're hoofers, that's all\u2014just\nan Earth-chained bunch of hoofers,\neven Marie. And I'm a tumbler. A\nborn tumbler. Know what that\nmeans? It means\u2014God, what does\nit mean? It means out in Big Bottomless,\nwhere Earth's like a fat\nmoon with fuzzy mold growing on\nit. Mold, that's all you are, just\nmold.\n  \n \n  A dog barked, and he wondered\nif he had been muttering aloud. He\ncame to a fence-gap and paused in\nthe darkness. The road wound\naround and came up the hill in\nfront of the house. Maybe they were\nsitting on the porch. Maybe they'd\nalready heard him coming. Maybe ...\n  \n \n  He was trembling again. He\nfished the fifth of gin out of his\ncoat pocket and sloshed it. Still over\nhalf a pint. He decided to kill it. It\nwouldn't do to go home with a\nbottle sticking out of his pocket.\nHe stood there in the night wind,\nsipping at it, and watching the reddish\nmoon come up in the east. The\nmoon looked as phoney as the\nsetting sun.\n  \n \n  He straightened in sudden determination.\nIt had to be sometime.\nGet it over with, get it over with\nnow. He opened the fence-gap, slipped\nthrough, and closed it firmly\nbehind him.",
        " He retrieved his bag,\nand waded quietly through the tall\ngrass until he reached the hedge\nwhich divided an area of sickly\npeach trees from the field. He got\nover the hedge somehow, and started\nthrough the trees toward the\nhouse. He stumbled over some old\nboards, and they clattered.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Shhh!\n   \n  \" he hissed, and moved\non.\n  \n \n  The dogs were barking angrily,\nand he heard a screen door slam.\nHe stopped.\n  \n \n  \"Ho there!\" a male voice called\nexperimentally from the house.\n  \n \n  One of Marie's brothers. Hogey\nstood frozen in the shadow of a\npeach tree, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Anybody out there?\" the man\ncalled again.\n  \n \n  Hogey waited, then heard the\nman muttering, \"Sic 'im, boy, sic\n'im.\"\n  \n \n  The hound's bark became eager.\nThe animal came chasing down the\nslope, and stopped ten feet away to\ncrouch and bark frantically at the\nshadow in the gloom. He knew the\ndog.\n  \n \n  \"Hooky!\" he whispered. \"Hooky\nboy\u2014here!\"\n  \n \n  The dog stopped barking, sniffed,\ntrotted closer, and went\n\"\n   \n   Rrrooff!\n   \n  \" Then he started sniffing\nsuspiciously again.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Hooky, here boy!\" he\nwhispered.\n  \n \n  The dog came forward silently,\nsniffed his hand, and whined in\nrecognition. Then he trotted around\nHogey, panting doggy affection and\ndancing an invitation to romp. The\nman whistled from the porch. The\ndog froze, then trotted quickly back\nup the slope.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing, eh, Hooky?\" the\nman on the porch said. \"Chasin'\narmadillos again, eh?\"\n  \n \n  The screen door slammed again,\nand the porch light went out.\nHogey stood there staring, unable\nto think. Somewhere beyond the\nwindow lights were\u2014his woman,\nhis son.\n  \n \n  What the hell was a tumbler doing\nwith a woman and a son?\n  \n \n  After perhaps a minute, he stepped\nforward again. He tripped over\na shovel, and his foot plunged into\nsomething that went\n   \n   squelch\n   \n  and\nswallowed the foot past the ankle.\nHe fell forward into a heap of\nsand, and his foot went deeper into\nthe sloppy wetness.\n  \n \n  He lay there with his stinging\nforehead on his arms, cursing softly\nand crying. Finally he rolled\nover, pulled his foot out of the\nmess, and took off his shoes. They\nwere full of mud\u2014sticky sandy\nmud.\n  \n \n  The dark world was reeling\nabout him, and the wind was dragging\nat his breath. He fell back\nagainst the sand pile and let his\nfeet sink in the mud hole and wriggled\nhis toes. He was laughing\nsoundlessly, and his face was wet\nin the wind. He couldn't think. He\ncouldn't remember where he was\nand why, and he stopped caring,\nand after a while he felt better.\n  \n \n  The stars were swimming over\nhim, dancing crazily, and the mud\ncooled his feet, and the sand was\nsoft behind him. He saw a rocket\ngo up on a tail of flame from the\nstation, and waited for the sound of\nits blast, but he was already asleep\nwhen it came.\n  \n \n  It was far past midnight when he\nbecame conscious of the dog licking\nwetly at his ear and cheek. He\npushed the animal away with a low\ncurse and mopped at the side of his\nface. He stirred, and groaned. His\nfeet were burning up! He tried to\npull them toward him, but they\nwouldn't budge. There was something\nwrong with his legs.\n  \n \n  For an instant he stared wildly\naround in the night. Then he remembered\nwhere he was, closed his\neyes and shuddered. When he\nopened them again, the moon had\nemerged from behind a cloud, and\nhe could see clearly the cruel trap\ninto which he had accidentally\nstumbled. A pile of old boards, a\ncareful stack of new lumber, a\npick and shovel, a sand-pile, heaps\nof fresh-turned earth, and a concrete\nmixer\u2014well, it added up.\n  \n \n  He gripped his ankles and pulled,\nbut his feet wouldn't budge. In\nsudden terror, he tried to stand up,\nbut his ankles were clutched by the\nconcrete too, and he fell back in\nthe sand with a low moan. He lay\nstill for several minutes, considering\ncarefully.\n  \n \n  He pulled at his left foot. It was\nlocked in a vise. He tugged even\nmore desperately at his right foot.\nIt was equally immovable.\n  \n \n  He sat up with a whimper and\nclawed at the rough concrete until\nhis nails tore and his fingertips\nbled. The surface still felt damp,\nbut it had hardened while he slept.\n  \n \n  He sat there stunned until Hooky\nbegan licking at his scuffed fingers.\nHe shouldered the dog away, and\ndug his hands into the sand-pile to\nstop the bleeding. Hooky licked at\nhis face, panting love.\n  \n \n  \"Get away!\" he croaked savagely.\n  \n \n  The dog whined softly, trotted\na short distance away, circled, and\ncame back to crouch down in the\nsand directly before Hogey, inching\nforward experimentally.\n  \n \n  Hogey gripped fistfuls of the dry\nsand and cursed between his teeth,\nwhile his eyes wandered over the\nsky. They came to rest on the sliver\nof light\u2014the space station\u2014rising\nin the west, floating out in Big Bottomless\nwhere the gang was\u2014Nichols\nand Guerrera and Lavrenti\nand Fats. And he wasn't forgetting\nKeesey, the rookie who'd replaced\nhim.\n  \n \n  Keesey would have a rough time\nfor a while\u2014rough as a cob. The pit\nwas no playground. The first time\nyou went out of the station in a\nsuit, the pit got you. Everything\nwas falling, and you fell, with it.\nEverything. The skeletons of steel,\nthe tire-shaped station, the spheres\nand docks and nightmare shapes\u2014all\ntied together by umbilical cables\nand flexible tubes. Like some crazy\nsea-thing they seemed, floating in a\nblack ocean with its tentacles bound\ntogether by drifting strands in the\ndark tide that bore it.\n  \n \n \n  Everything was pain-bright or\ndead black, and it wheeled around\nyou, and you went nuts trying to\nfigure which way was down. In fact,\nit took you months to teach your\nbody that\n   \n   all\n   \n  ways were down and\nthat the pit was bottomless.\n  \n \n  He became conscious of a plaintive\nsound in the wind, and froze to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  It was a baby crying.\n  \n \n  It was nearly a minute before he\ngot the significance of it. It hit him\nwhere he lived, and he began jerking\nfrantically at his encased feet\nand sobbing low in his throat.\nThey'd hear him if he kept that up.\nHe stopped and covered his ears to\nclose out the cry of his firstborn. A\nlight went on in the house, and\nwhen it went off again, the infant's\ncry had ceased.\n  \n \n  Another rocket went up from the\nstation, and he cursed it. Space was\na disease, and he had it.\n  \n \n  \"Help!\" he cried out suddenly.\n\"I'm stuck! Help me, help me!\"\n  \n \n  He knew he was yelling hysterically\nat the sky and fighting the relentless\nconcrete that clutched his\nfeet, and after a moment he stopped.\n  \n \n  The light was on in the house\nagain, and he heard faint sounds.\nThe stirring-about woke the baby\nagain, and once more the infant's\nwail came on the breeze.\n  \n \n \n   Make the kid shut up, make the\nkid shut up ...\n   \n \n \n  But that was no good. It wasn't\nthe kid's fault. It wasn't Marie's\nfault. No fathers allowed in space,\nthey said, but it wasn't their fault\neither. They were right, and he had\nonly himself to blame. The kid was\nan accident, but that didn't change\nanything. Not a thing in the world.\nIt remained a tragedy.\n  \n \n  A tumbler had no business with a\nfamily, but what was a man going\nto do? Take a skinning knife, boy,\nand make yourself a eunuch. But\nthat was no good either. They needed\nbulls out there in the pit, not\nsteers. And when a man came down\nfrom a year's hitch, what was he\ngoing to do? Live in a lonely shack\nand read books for kicks? Because\nyou were a man, you sought out a\nwoman. And because she was a\nwoman, she got a kid, and that was\nthe end of it. It was nobody's fault,\nnobody's at all.\n  \n \n  He stared at the red eye of Mars\nlow in the southwest. They were\nrunning out there now, and next\nyear he would have been on the\nlong long run ...\n  \n \n  But there was no use thinking\nabout it. Next year and the years\nafter belonged to\n   \n   little\n   \n  Hogey.\n  \n \n  He sat there with his feet locked\nin the solid concrete of the footing,\nstaring out into Big Bottomless\nwhile his son's cry came from the\nhouse and the Hauptman menfolk\ncame wading through the tall grass\nin search of someone who had cried\nout. His feet were stuck tight, and\nhe wouldn't ever get them out. He\nwas sobbing softly when they found\nhim.\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Fantastic Universe\n  \n September 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and\ntypographical errors have been corrected without note.\n\n<doc-sep>In the street, even before he'd wiped off the foam, he regretted\nhis flight. The fire was back home. And here in the cold of this\nfog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail between heaped-up walls of rubble,\nthe diaper he wore felt inadequate against the pre-dawn cold. His\ncherished weapon, a magnetic tack-hammer, was chill beneath the\ndiaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wristwatch suspended from\na string around his neck hung clammy against his chest. He stood\nirresolute on numbing bare feet, and considered returning to the more\nfamiliar bedlam.\n  \n \n  But colder than cold was his shame at being cold. Molly never was,\nthough she knew how to keep him warm, nor were the others. Hunger,\nthirst, pain and coldness were sensations never experienced by his\nfriends. Like the growth he'd been undergoing till recently, these were\nthings of ignominy, to be hidden as far as possible from inquiring\neyes. Cold as it was, he'd have to hide.\n  \n \n  Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite\ncomplete. From above the fog, the moon played vaguely deceptive light\non the splinters of architecture looming toward it. Some distance off,\nan owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak and\nrustle as they scampered.\n  \n \n  The world seemed ghostly. Yet it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. And as\nan irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need for sleep even\nin the midst of danger, he concluded for the thousandth time that the\nOne who'd built him must have been an apprentice.\n  \n \n  For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which he now\nwalked. It had been the haven of his adolescence, when the discovery of\nhow much he differed from his friends had been a shock, and the shock\nitself a difference to be hidden.\n  \n \n  His hiding place was a manhole, dead center in the dead street. A\nweathered bronze bar, carefully placed in the cover's slotted rim, was\nthe levering key that opened its door.\n  \n \n \n   Everything\n   \n  was wrong tonight! He couldn't even find the bar. Of\ncourse that spoiled things, because the bar was a roller on which to\nmove the heavy cover from below, and a support that held it ajar for\nventilation.\n  \n \n  But the example of his friends had taught him above all else to carry\nout every purpose. Molly was a nurse; she had raised him despite all\nobstacles. The soldiers were guards; they protected the ruins against\neverything larger than a rat. The firefighter had put even\n   \n   him\n   \n  out\nwhen he was aflame....\n  \n \n  Anyhow, the manhole cover had been loosened by his frequent handling.\nHe lifted it aside by main strength, then flattened himself to the\nstreet, and felt with his feet for the top rung.\n  \n \n  Halfway down the iron ladder, something made him pause. He looked, but\nsaw only blackness. He listened, sniffed, found nothing. What could\nhave entered through the iron cover?\n  \n \n  He sneered at his own timidity and jumped to the bottom.\n  \n \n  It was warm! The dry bottom of the hole had the temperature of body\nheat, as if a large animal had recently rested there!\n  \n<doc-sep>The others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Butch scowled.\n  \n \n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n  \n \n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it\u2014Butcher?\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could walk us over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n  \n \n  \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n  \n \n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n  \n \n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n  \n \n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n  \n \n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n  \n \n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n  \n \n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n  \n"

You\nwanta Indian wrestle?\"\n  \n \n  The girl, who sat nervously staring\nat him, smiled wanly, and\nshook her head.\n  \n \n  \"Quiet li'l pigeon, aren'tcha?\" he\nburbled affectionately, crashing into\nthe seat beside her.\n  \n \n  The two men slid out of their\nseats, and a hand clamped his shoulder.\n\"Come on, Broken Wing, let's\ngo back to bed.\"\n  \n \n  \"My name's Hogey,\" he said.\n\"Big Hogey Parker. I was just kidding\nabout being a Indian.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Come on, let's go have a\ndrink.\" They got him on his feet,\nand led him stumbling back down\nthe aisle.\n  \n \n  \"My ma was half Cherokee, see?\nThat's how come I said it. You\nwanta hear a war whoop? Real\nstuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind.\"\n  \n \n  He cupped his hands to his\nmouth and favored them with a\nblood-curdling proof of his ancestry,\nwhile the female passengers\nstirred restlessly and hunched in\ntheir seats. The driver stopped the\nbus and went back to warn him\nagainst any further display. The\ndriver flashed a deputy's badge and\nthreatened to turn him over to a\nconstable.\n  \n \n  \"I gotta get home,\" Big Hogey\ntold him. \"I got me a son now,\nthat's why. You know? A little\nbaby pigeon of a son. Haven't seen\nhim yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will you just sit still and be\nquiet then, eh?\"\n  \n \n  Big Hogey nodded emphatically.\n\"Shorry, officer, I didn't mean to\nmake any trouble.\"\n  \n \n  When the bus started again, he\nfell on his side and lay still. He\nmade retching sounds for a time,\nthen rested, snoring softly. The bus\ndriver woke him again at Caine's\njunction, retrieved his gin bottle\nfrom behind the seat, and helped\nhim down the aisle and out of the\nbus.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey stumbled about for a\nmoment, then sat down hard in the\ngravel at the shoulder of the road.\nThe driver paused with one foot on\nthe step, looking around. There was\nnot even a store at the road junction,\nbut only a freight building\nnext to the railroad track, a couple\nof farmhouses at the edge of a side-road,\nand, just across the way, a deserted\nfilling station with a sagging\nroof. The land was Great Plains\ncountry, treeless, barren, and rolling.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey got up and staggered\naround in front of the bus, clutching\nat it for support, losing his\nduffle bag.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, watch the traffic!\" The\ndriver warned. With a surge of unwelcome\ncompassion he trotted\naround after his troublesome passenger,\ntaking his arm as he sagged\nagain. \"You crossing?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yah,\" Hogey muttered. \"Lemme\nalone, I'm okay.\"\n  \n \n  The driver started across the\nhighway with him. The traffic was\nsparse, but fast and dangerous in\nthe central ninety-mile lane.\n  \n \n  \"I'm okay,\" Hogey kept protesting.\n\"I'm a tumbler, ya know?\nGravity's got me. Damn gravity.\nI'm not used to gravity, ya know? I\nused to be a tumbler\u2014\n   \n   huk!\n   \n  \u2014only\nnow I gotta be a hoofer. 'Count\nof li'l Hogey. You know about li'l\nHogey?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Your son. Come on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, you gotta son? I bet you\ngotta son.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two kids,\" said the driver,\ncatching Hogey's bag as it slipped\nfrom his shoulder. \"Both girls.\"\n  \n \n  \"Say, you oughta be home with\nthem kids. Man oughta stick with\nhis family. You oughta get another\njob.\" Hogey eyed him owlishly,\nwaggled a moralistic finger, skidded\non the gravel as they stepped\nonto the opposite shoulder, and\nsprawled again.\n  \n \n  The driver blew a weary breath,\nlooked down at him, and shook his\nhead. Maybe it'd be kinder to find\na constable after all. This guy could\nget himself killed, wandering\naround loose.\n  \n \n  \"Somebody supposed to meet\nyou?\" he asked, squinting around\nat the dusty hills.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Huk!\n   \n  \u2014who, me?\" Hogey giggled,\nbelched, and shook his head.\n\"Nope. Nobody knows I'm coming.\nS'prise. I'm supposed to be here a\nweek ago.\" He looked up at the\ndriver with a pained expression.\n\"Week late, ya know? Marie's\ngonna be sore\u2014woo-\n   \n   hoo\n   \n  !\u2014is she\ngonna be sore!\" He waggled his\nhead severely at the ground.\n  \n \n  \"Which way are you going?\" the\ndriver grunted impatiently.\n  \n \n  Hogey pointed down the side-road\nthat led back into the hills.\n\"Marie's pop's place. You know\nwhere? 'Bout three miles from\nhere. Gotta walk, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't,\" the driver warned.\n\"You sit there by the culvert till\nyou get a ride. Okay?\"\n  \n \n  Hogey nodded forlornly.\n  \n \n  \"Now stay out of the road,\" the\ndriver warned, then hurried back\nacross the highway. Moments later,\nthe atomic battery-driven motors\ndroned mournfully, and the bus\npulled away.\n  \n \n  Big Hogey blinked after it, rubbing\nthe back of his neck. \"Nice\npeople,\" he said. \"Nice buncha people.\nAll hoofers.\"\n  \n \n  With a grunt and a lurch, he got\nto his feet, but his legs wouldn't\nwork right. With his tumbler's reflexes,\nhe fought to right himself\nwith frantic arm motions, but gravity\nclaimed him, and he went stumbling\ninto the ditch.\n  \n \n  \"Damn legs, damn crazy legs!\"\nhe cried.\n  \n \n  The bottom of the ditch was wet,\nand he crawled up the embankment\nwith mud-soaked knees, and sat on\nthe shoulder again. The gin bottle\nwas still intact. He had himself a\nlong fiery drink, and it warmed him\ndeep down. He blinked around at\nthe gaunt and treeless land.\n  \n \n  The sun was almost down, forge-red\non a dusty horizon. The blood-streaked\nsky faded into sulphurous\nyellow toward the zenith, and the\nvery air that hung over the land\nseemed full of yellow smoke, the\nomnipresent dust of the plains.\n  \n \n  A farm truck turned onto the\nside-road and moaned away, its\ndriver hardly glancing at the dark\nyoung man who sat swaying on his\nduffle bag near the culvert. Hogey\nscarcely noticed the vehicle. He just\nkept staring at the crazy sun.\n  \n \n  He shook his head. It wasn't really\nthe sun. The sun, the real sun,\nwas a hateful eye-sizzling horror in\nthe dead black pit. It painted everything\nwith pure white pain, and you\nsaw things by the reflected pain-light.\nThe fat red sun was strictly a\nphoney, and it didn't fool him any.\nHe hated it for what he knew it was\nbehind the gory mask, and for what\nit had done to his eyes.\n  \n \n \n  With a grunt, he got to his feet,\nmanaged to shoulder the duffle bag,\nand started off down the middle of\nthe farm road, lurching from side\nto side, and keeping his eyes on the\nrolling distances. Another car turned\nonto the side-road, honking angrily.\n  \n \n  Hogey tried to turn around to\nlook at it, but he forgot to shift his\nfooting. He staggered and went\ndown on the pavement. The car's\ntires screeched on the hot asphalt.\nHogey lay there for a moment,\ngroaning. That one had hurt his\nhip. A car door slammed and a big\nman with a florid face got out and\nstalked toward him, looking angry.\n  \n \n  \"What the hell's the matter with\nyou, fella?\" he drawled. \"You\nsoused? Man, you've really got a\nload.\"\n  \n \n  Hogey got up doggedly, shaking\nhis head to clear it. \"Space legs,\" he\nprevaricated. \"Got space legs. Can't\nstand the gravity.\"\n  \n \n  The burly farmer retrieved his\ngin bottle for him, still miraculously\nunbroken. \"Here's your gravity,\"\nhe grunted. \"Listen, fella, you better\nget home pronto.\"\n  \n \n  \"Pronto? Hey, I'm no Mex. Honest,\nI'm just space burned. You\nknow?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Say, who are you, anyway?\nDo you live around here?\"\n  \n \n  It was obvious that the big man\nhad taken him for a hobo or a\ntramp. Hogey pulled himself together.\n\"Goin' to the Hauptman's\nplace. Marie. You know Marie?\"\n  \n \n  The farmer's eyebrows went up.\n\"Marie Hauptman? Sure I know\nher. Only she's Marie Parker now.\nHas been, nigh on six years. Say\u2014\"\nHe paused, then gaped. \"You ain't\nher husband by any chance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogey, that's me. Big Hogey\nParker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I'll be\u2014! Get in the car.\nI'm going right past John Hauptman's\nplace. Boy, you're in no\nshape to walk it.\"\n  \n \n  He grinned wryly, waggled his\nhead, and helped Hogey and his\nbag into the back seat. A woman\nwith a sun-wrinkled neck sat rigidly\nbeside the farmer in the front,\nand she neither greeted the passenger\nnor looked around.\n  \n \n  \"They don't make cars like this\nanymore,\" the farmer called over\nthe growl of the ancient gasoline\nengine and the grind of gears.\n\"You can have them new atomics\nwith their loads of hot isotopes\nunder the seat. Ain't safe, I say\u2014eh,\nMartha?\"\n  \n \n  The woman with the sun-baked\nneck quivered her head slightly.\n\"A car like this was good enough\nfor Pa, an' I reckon it's good\nenough for us,\" she drawled mournfully.\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the car drew\nin to the side of the road. \"Reckon\nyou can walk it from here,\" the\nfarmer said. \"That's Hauptman's\nroad just up ahead.\"\n  \n \n  He helped Hogey out of the car\nand drove away without looking\nback to see if Hogey stayed on his\nfeet. The woman with the sun-baked\nneck was suddenly talking\ngarrulously in his direction.\n  \n \n  It was twilight. The sun had set,\nand the yellow sky was turning\ngray. Hogey was too tired to go on,\nand his legs would no longer hold\nhim. He blinked around at the land,\ngot his eyes focused, and found\nwhat looked like Hauptman's place\non a distant hillside. It was a big\nframe house surrounded by a wheatfield,\nand a few scrawny trees. Having\nlocated it, he stretched out in\nthe tall grass beyond the ditch to\ntake a little rest.\n  \n \n  Somewhere dogs were barking,\nand a cricket sang creaking monotony\nin the grass. Once there was the\ndistant thunder of a rocket blast\nfrom the launching station six miles\nto the west, but it faded quickly. An\nA-motored convertible whined past\non the road, but Hogey went unseen.\n  \n \n  When he awoke, it was night,\nand he was shivering. His stomach\nwas screeching, and his nerves dancing\nwith high voltages. He sat up\nand groped for his watch, then remembered\nhe had pawned it after\nthe poker game. Remembering the\ngame and the results of the game\nmade him wince and bite his lip\nand grope for the bottle again.\n  \n \n  He sat breathing heavily for a\nmoment after the stiff drink. Equating\ntime to position had become\nsecond nature with him, but he had\nto think for a moment because his\ndefective vision prevented him from\nseeing the Earth-crescent.\n  \n \n  Vega was almost straight above\nhim in the late August sky, so he\nknew it wasn't much after sundown\u2014probably\nabout eight o'clock. He\nbraced himself with another swallow\nof gin, picked himself up and\ngot back to the road, feeling a little\nsobered after the nap.\n  \n \n  He limped on up the pavement\nand turned left at the narrow drive\nthat led between barbed-wire fences\ntoward the Hauptman farmhouse,\nfive hundred yards or so from the\nfarm road. The fields on his left\nbelonged to Marie's father, he\nknew. He was getting close\u2014close\nto home and woman and child.\n  \n \n  He dropped the bag suddenly\nand leaned against a fence post,\nrolling his head on his forearms\nand choking in spasms of air. He\nwas shaking all over, and his belly\nwrithed. He wanted to turn and\nrun. He wanted to crawl out in the\ngrass and hide.\n  \n \n  What were they going to say?\nAnd Marie, Marie most of all.\nHow was he going to tell her about\nthe money?\n  \n \n  Six hitches in space, and every\ntime the promise had been the\nsame:\n   \n   One more tour, baby, and\nwe'll have enough dough, and then\nI'll quit for good. One more time,\nand we'll have our stake\u2014enough\nto open a little business, or buy a\nhouse with a mortgage and get a\njob.\n   \n \n \n  And she had waited, but the\nmoney had never been quite enough\nuntil this time. This time the tour\nhad lasted nine months, and he had\nsigned on for every run from station\nto moon-base to pick up the\nbonuses. And this time he'd made\nit. Two weeks ago, there had been\nforty-eight hundred in the bank.\nAnd now ...\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Why?\n   \n  \" he groaned, striking his\nforehead against his forearms. His\narm slipped, and his head hit the\ntop of the fencepost, and the pain\nblinded him for a moment. He staggered\nback into the road with a\nlow roar, wiped blood from his\nforehead, and savagely kicked his\nbag.\n  \n \n  It rolled a couple of yards up the\nroad. He leaped after it and kicked\nit again. When he had finished\nwith it, he stood panting and angry,\nbut feeling better.",
        " He shouldered\nthe bag and hiked on toward the\nfarmhouse.\n  \n \n  They're hoofers, that's all\u2014just\nan Earth-chained bunch of hoofers,\neven Marie. And I'm a tumbler. A\nborn tumbler. Know what that\nmeans? It means\u2014God, what does\nit mean? It means out in Big Bottomless,\nwhere Earth's like a fat\nmoon with fuzzy mold growing on\nit. Mold, that's all you are, just\nmold.\n  \n \n  A dog barked, and he wondered\nif he had been muttering aloud. He\ncame to a fence-gap and paused in\nthe darkness. The road wound\naround and came up the hill in\nfront of the house. Maybe they were\nsitting on the porch. Maybe they'd\nalready heard him coming. Maybe ...\n  \n \n  He was trembling again. He\nfished the fifth of gin out of his\ncoat pocket and sloshed it. Still over\nhalf a pint. He decided to kill it. It\nwouldn't do to go home with a\nbottle sticking out of his pocket.\nHe stood there in the night wind,\nsipping at it, and watching the reddish\nmoon come up in the east. The\nmoon looked as phoney as the\nsetting sun.\n  \n \n  He straightened in sudden determination.\nIt had to be sometime.\nGet it over with, get it over with\nnow. He opened the fence-gap, slipped\nthrough, and closed it firmly\nbehind him. He retrieved his bag,\nand waded quietly through the tall\ngrass until he reached the hedge\nwhich divided an area of sickly\npeach trees from the field. He got\nover the hedge somehow, and started\nthrough the trees toward the\nhouse. He stumbled over some old\nboards, and they clattered.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Shhh!\n   \n  \" he hissed, and moved\non.\n  \n \n  The dogs were barking angrily,\nand he heard a screen door slam.\nHe stopped.\n  \n \n  \"Ho there!\" a male voice called\nexperimentally from the house.\n  \n \n  One of Marie's brothers. Hogey\nstood frozen in the shadow of a\npeach tree, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Anybody out there?\" the man\ncalled again.\n  \n \n  Hogey waited, then heard the\nman muttering, \"Sic 'im, boy, sic\n'im.\"\n  \n \n  The hound's bark became eager.\nThe animal came chasing down the\nslope, and stopped ten feet away to\ncrouch and bark frantically at the\nshadow in the gloom. He knew the\ndog.\n  \n \n  \"Hooky!\" he whispered. \"Hooky\nboy\u2014here!\"\n  \n \n  The dog stopped barking, sniffed,\ntrotted closer, and went\n\"\n   \n   Rrrooff!\n   \n  \" Then he started sniffing\nsuspiciously again.\n  \n \n  \"Easy, Hooky, here boy!\" he\nwhispered.\n  \n \n  The dog came forward silently,\nsniffed his hand, and whined in\nrecognition. Then he trotted around\nHogey, panting doggy affection and\ndancing an invitation to romp. The\nman whistled from the porch. The\ndog froze, then trotted quickly back\nup the slope.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing, eh, Hooky?\" the\nman on the porch said. \"Chasin'\narmadillos again, eh?\"\n  \n \n  The screen door slammed again,\nand the porch light went out.\nHogey stood there staring, unable\nto think. Somewhere beyond the\nwindow lights were\u2014his woman,\nhis son.\n  \n \n  What the hell was a tumbler doing\nwith a woman and a son?\n  \n \n  After perhaps a minute, he stepped\nforward again. He tripped over\na shovel, and his foot plunged into\nsomething that went\n   \n   squelch\n   \n  and\nswallowed the foot past the ankle.\nHe fell forward into a heap of\nsand, and his foot went deeper into\nthe sloppy wetness.\n  \n \n  He lay there with his stinging\nforehead on his arms, cursing softly\nand crying. Finally he rolled\nover, pulled his foot out of the\nmess, and took off his shoes. They\nwere full of mud\u2014sticky sandy\nmud.\n  \n \n  The dark world was reeling\nabout him, and the wind was dragging\nat his breath. He fell back\nagainst the sand pile and let his\nfeet sink in the mud hole and wriggled\nhis toes. He was laughing\nsoundlessly, and his face was wet\nin the wind. He couldn't think. He\ncouldn't remember where he was\nand why, and he stopped caring,\nand after a while he felt better.\n  \n \n  The stars were swimming over\nhim, dancing crazily, and the mud\ncooled his feet, and the sand was\nsoft behind him. He saw a rocket\ngo up on a tail of flame from the\nstation, and waited for the sound of\nits blast, but he was already asleep\nwhen it came.\n  \n \n  It was far past midnight when he\nbecame conscious of the dog licking\nwetly at his ear and cheek. He\npushed the animal away with a low\ncurse and mopped at the side of his\nface. He stirred, and groaned. His\nfeet were burning up! He tried to\npull them toward him, but they\nwouldn't budge. There was something\nwrong with his legs.\n  \n \n  For an instant he stared wildly\naround in the night. Then he remembered\nwhere he was, closed his\neyes and shuddered. When he\nopened them again, the moon had\nemerged from behind a cloud, and\nhe could see clearly the cruel trap\ninto which he had accidentally\nstumbled. A pile of old boards, a\ncareful stack of new lumber, a\npick and shovel, a sand-pile, heaps\nof fresh-turned earth, and a concrete\nmixer\u2014well, it added up.\n  \n \n  He gripped his ankles and pulled,\nbut his feet wouldn't budge. In\nsudden terror, he tried to stand up,\nbut his ankles were clutched by the\nconcrete too, and he fell back in\nthe sand with a low moan. He lay\nstill for several minutes, considering\ncarefully.\n  \n \n  He pulled at his left foot. It was\nlocked in a vise. He tugged even\nmore desperately at his right foot.\nIt was equally immovable.\n  \n \n  He sat up with a whimper and\nclawed at the rough concrete until\nhis nails tore and his fingertips\nbled. The surface still felt damp,\nbut it had hardened while he slept.\n  \n \n  He sat there stunned until Hooky\nbegan licking at his scuffed fingers.\nHe shouldered the dog away, and\ndug his hands into the sand-pile to\nstop the bleeding. Hooky licked at\nhis face, panting love.\n  \n \n  \"Get away!\" he croaked savagely.\n  \n \n  The dog whined softly, trotted\na short distance away, circled, and\ncame back to crouch down in the\nsand directly before Hogey, inching\nforward experimentally.\n  \n \n  Hogey gripped fistfuls of the dry\nsand and cursed between his teeth,\nwhile his eyes wandered over the\nsky. They came to rest on the sliver\nof light\u2014the space station\u2014rising\nin the west, floating out in Big Bottomless\nwhere the gang was\u2014Nichols\nand Guerrera and Lavrenti\nand Fats. And he wasn't forgetting\nKeesey, the rookie who'd replaced\nhim.\n  \n \n  Keesey would have a rough time\nfor a while\u2014rough as a cob. The pit\nwas no playground. The first time\nyou went out of the station in a\nsuit, the pit got you. Everything\nwas falling, and you fell, with it.\nEverything. The skeletons of steel,\nthe tire-shaped station, the spheres\nand docks and nightmare shapes\u2014all\ntied together by umbilical cables\nand flexible tubes. Like some crazy\nsea-thing they seemed, floating in a\nblack ocean with its tentacles bound\ntogether by drifting strands in the\ndark tide that bore it.\n  \n \n \n  Everything was pain-bright or\ndead black, and it wheeled around\nyou, and you went nuts trying to\nfigure which way was down. In fact,\nit took you months to teach your\nbody that\n   \n   all\n   \n  ways were down and\nthat the pit was bottomless.\n  \n \n  He became conscious of a plaintive\nsound in the wind, and froze to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  It was a baby crying.\n  \n \n  It was nearly a minute before he\ngot the significance of it. It hit him\nwhere he lived, and he began jerking\nfrantically at his encased feet\nand sobbing low in his throat.\nThey'd hear him if he kept that up.\nHe stopped and covered his ears to\nclose out the cry of his firstborn. A\nlight went on in the house, and\nwhen it went off again, the infant's\ncry had ceased.\n  \n \n  Another rocket went up from the\nstation, and he cursed it. Space was\na disease, and he had it.\n  \n \n  \"Help!\" he cried out suddenly.\n\"I'm stuck! Help me, help me!\"\n  \n \n  He knew he was yelling hysterically\nat the sky and fighting the relentless\nconcrete that clutched his\nfeet, and after a moment he stopped.\n  \n \n  The light was on in the house\nagain, and he heard faint sounds.\nThe stirring-about woke the baby\nagain, and once more the infant's\nwail came on the breeze.\n  \n \n \n   Make the kid shut up, make the\nkid shut up ...\n   \n \n \n  But that was no good. It wasn't\nthe kid's fault. It wasn't Marie's\nfault. No fathers allowed in space,\nthey said, but it wasn't their fault\neither. They were right, and he had\nonly himself to blame. The kid was\nan accident, but that didn't change\nanything. Not a thing in the world.\nIt remained a tragedy.\n  \n \n  A tumbler had no business with a\nfamily, but what was a man going\nto do? Take a skinning knife, boy,\nand make yourself a eunuch. But\nthat was no good either. They needed\nbulls out there in the pit, not\nsteers. And when a man came down\nfrom a year's hitch, what was he\ngoing to do? Live in a lonely shack\nand read books for kicks? Because\nyou were a man, you sought out a\nwoman. And because she was a\nwoman, she got a kid, and that was\nthe end of it. It was nobody's fault,\nnobody's at all.\n  \n \n  He stared at the red eye of Mars\nlow in the southwest. They were\nrunning out there now, and next\nyear he would have been on the\nlong long run ...\n  \n \n  But there was no use thinking\nabout it. Next year and the years\nafter belonged to\n   \n   little\n   \n  Hogey.\n  \n \n  He sat there with his feet locked\nin the solid concrete of the footing,\nstaring out into Big Bottomless\nwhile his son's cry came from the\nhouse and the Hauptman menfolk\ncame wading through the tall grass\nin search of someone who had cried\nout. His feet were stuck tight, and\nhe wouldn't ever get them out. He\nwas sobbing softly when they found\nhim.\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Fantastic Universe\n  \n September 1955.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

But what can a man\nin the full vigor of youth do\u2014if his heart cries out for a home?\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Butch scowled.\n  \n \n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n  \n \n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it\u2014Butcher?\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could walk us over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n  \n \n  \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n  \n \n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n  \n \n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n  \n \n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n  \n \n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n  \n \n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n  \n \n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n  \n"

        "Tolliver found himself dumped on the floor of an empty office in the\nadjoining warehouse building. It seemed to him that a long time had\nbeen spent in carrying him there.\n  \n \n  He heard an indignant yelp, and realized that the girl had been pitched\nin with him. The snapping of a lock was followed by the tramp of\ndeparting footsteps and then by silence.\n  \n \n  After considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up.\n  \n \n  He had his wind back. But when he fingered the swelling lump behind his\nleft ear, a sensation befuddled him momentarily.\n  \n \n  \"I'm sorry about that,\" murmured Betty.\n  \n \n  Tolliver grunted. Sorrow would not reduce the throbbing, nor was he\nin a mood to undertake an explanation of why Jeffers did not like him\nanyway.\n  \n \n  \"I think perhaps you're going to have a shiner,\" remarked the girl.\n  \n \n  \"Thanks for letting me know in time,\" said Tolliver.\n  \n \n  The skin under his right eye did feel a trifle tight, but he could see\nwell enough. The abandoned and empty look of the office worried him.\n  \n \n  \"What can we use to get out of here?\" he mused.\n  \n \n  \"Why should we try?\" asked the girl. \"What can he do?\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd be surprised. How did you catch on to him so soon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Your paycheck,\" said Betty. \"As soon as I saw that ridiculous amount,\nit was obvious that there was gross mismanagement here. It had to be\nJeffers.\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver groaned.\n  \n \n  \"Then, on the way over here, he as good as admitted everything. You\ndidn't hear him, I guess. Well, he seemed to be caught all unaware, and\nseemed to blame you for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure!\" grumbled the pilot. \"He thinks I told you he was grafting or\nsmuggling, or whatever he has going for him here. That's why I want to\nget out of here\u2014before I find myself involved in some kind of fatal\naccident!\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you know about the crooked goings-on here?\" asked Betty after\na startled pause.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" retorted Tolliver. \"Except that there are some. There are\nrumors, and I had a halfway invitation to join in. I think he sells\nthings to the mining colonies and makes a double profit for himself by\nclaiming the stuff lost in transit. You didn't think you scared him\nthat bad over a little slack managing?\"\n  \n \n  The picture of Jeffers huddled with his partners in the headquarters\nbuilding, plotting the next move, brought Tolliver to his feet.\n  \n \n  There was nothing in the unused office but an old table and half a\ndozen plastic crates. He saw that the latter contained a mess of\ndiscarded records.\n  \n \n  \"Better than nothing at all,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  He ripped out a double handful of the forms, crumpled them into a pile\nat the doorway, and pulled out his cigarette lighter.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think you're up to?\" asked Betty with some concern.\n  \n \n  \"This plastic is tough,\" said Tolliver, \"but it will bend with enough\nheat. If I can kick loose a hinge, maybe we can fool them yet!\"\n  \n \n  He got a little fire going, and fed it judiciously with more papers.\n  \n \n  \"You know,\" he reflected, \"it might be better for you to stay here.\nHe can't do much about you, and you don't have any real proof just by\nyourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll come along with you, Tolliver,\" said the girl.\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think you'd better.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well ... after all, what would he dare do? Arranging an accident to\nthe daughter of the boss isn't something that he can pull off without a\nlot of investigation. He'd be better off just running for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's not argue about it,\" said Betty, a trifle pale but looking\ndetermined. \"I'm coming with you. Is that stuff getting soft yet?\"\n  \n \n  Tolliver kicked at the edge of the door experimentally. It seemed to\ngive slightly, so he knocked the burning papers aside and drove his\nheel hard at the corner below the hinge.\n  \n \n  The plastic yielded.\n  \n \n  \"That's enough already, Tolliver,\" whispered the girl. \"We can crawl\nthrough!\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n   A wayfarer's return from a far country to his wife and family may be a\nshining experience, a kind of second honeymoon.

If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\n  \n \n  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\n  \n \n  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n"

It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body. A human body.\n  \n<doc-sep>As the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank came\nup out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and\ncoat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk.

He started along the street\ntoward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the\nvault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there\nwas room for another tier. He was glad to be finished.\n  \n \n  At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The\nstreet was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around\u2014and froze.\n  \n \n  From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large\nand shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind.\n  \n \n  What the hell was it?\n  \n \n  Mason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and\nhungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner\ntable. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous\nand ugly. The light was bad; he couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew\nhim on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made\nhim uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened\u2014and fascinated.\n  \n \n  And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.\n  \n<doc-sep>He sank into the softness of his bed. As he turned over on his side,\nhis gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room.\n  \n \n  He sat straight up, his chest heaving.\n  \n \n  The object was a tri-dimensional photo of a rock-faced man in a\nmerchant spaceman's uniform. He was a giant of a man with a neatly\ntrimmed\n   \n   red beard\n   \n  !\n  \n \n  Ben stared at the photo for a long time. At length, he slipped into\nrestless sleep. Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his\nbrain.\n  \n \n  The dead man returned to him. Bloodied lips cursed at him. Glassy eyes\naccused him. Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night.\n  \n \n  And towering above him was a red-bearded man whose great hands reached\ndown and beckoned to him. Ben crawled through the night on hands and\nknees, his legs numb and useless. The crying of the children was a\nchilling wail in his ears.\n  \n \n  His head rose and turned to the red-bearded man. His pleading voice\nscreamed out to him in a thick, harsh cackle. Yet even as he screamed,\nthe giant disappeared, to be replaced by white-booted feet stomping\nrelentlessly toward him.\n  \n \n  He awoke still screaming....\n  \n \n  A night without darkness passed. Ben lay waiting for Maggie's return, a\nquestion already formed in his mind.\n  \n \n  She came and at once he asked, \"Who is the man with the red beard?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog.

That's\nwhy you saved me?\"\n  \n \n  \"We need all the good men we can get.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  She cocked her head in mock suspicion. \"Somewhere between Mercury and\nPluto. He's building a new base for us\u2014and a home for me.

Communists or Fascists taking\nover.\" He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands\nshaking. \"I'm glad to know it's on the level.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's on the level.\" The police car was getting near the Hall of\nJustice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights\nhad not yet come on.\n  \n \n  \"I feel better,\" Loyce said. \"I was pretty excited there, for a minute.\nI guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to\ntake me in, is there?\"\n  \n \n  The two cops said nothing.\n  \n \n  \"I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all\nright, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"This won't take long,\" the cop behind the wheel interrupted. \"A short\nprocess. Only a few minutes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I hope it's short,\" Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a\nstoplight. \"I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting\nexcited like that and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled\nto his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light\nchanged. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people,\nburrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts,\npeople running.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in\nPikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small\ntown for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.\n  \n \n  They weren't cops\u2014and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter,\nFergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't\nknow\u2014and they didn't care.\n   \n   That\n   \n  was the strange part.\n  \n \n  Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the\nstartled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the\nback door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete\nsteps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side,\ngasping and panting.\n  \n \n  There was no sound behind him. He had got away.\n  \n \n  He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and\nruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street\nlight wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.\n  \n \n  And to his right\u2014the police station.\n  \n \n  He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery\nstore rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred\nwindows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the\ndarkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to\nkeep moving, get farther away from them.\n  \n \n \n   Them?\n   \n \n \n  Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the\nCity Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass\nand broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark\nwindows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.\n  \n \n  And\u2014something else.\n  \n \n  Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than\nthe surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost\ninto the sky.\n  \n \n  He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him\nstruggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound.\nA buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.\n  \n \n  Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over\nthe City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid.\n   \n   In the vortex\nsomething moved.\n   \n  Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky,\npausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense\nswarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.\n  \n \n  Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that\nhung above him.\n  \n \n  He was seeing\u2014them.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"Look at it!\" Loyce snapped. \"Come on out here!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe\ncoat with dignity. \"This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy\nstanding there.\"\n  \n \n  \"See it?\" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up\nagainst the sky\u2014the post and the bundle swinging from it. \"There it is.\nHow the hell long has it been there?\" His voice rose excitedly. \"What's\nwrong with everybody? They just walk on past!\"\n  \n \n  Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. \"Take it easy, old man. There must\nbe a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.\"\n  \n \n  \"A reason! What kind of a reason?\"\n  \n \n  Fergusson shrugged. \"Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that\nwrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?\"\n  \n \n  Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. \"What's up, boys?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's a body hanging from the lamppost,\" Loyce said. \"I'm going to\ncall the cops.\"\n  \n \n  \"They must know about it,\" Potter said. \"Or otherwise it wouldn't be\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I got to get back in.\" Fergusson headed back into the store. \"Business\nbefore pleasure.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce began to get hysterical. \"You see it? You see it hanging there? A\nman's body! A dead man!\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean it's been there all afternoon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure. What's the matter?\" Potter glanced at his watch. \"Have to run.\nSee you later, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the\nsidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously\nat the dark bundle\u2014and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any\nattention.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going nuts,\" Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and\ncrossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him.\nHe gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.\n  \n \n  The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray\nsuit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never\nseen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and\nin the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin\nwas gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A\npair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His\neyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.\n  \n \n  \"For Heaven's sake,\" Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea\nand made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with\nrevulsion\u2014and fear.\n  \n \n \n   Why?\n   \n  Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?\n  \n \n  And\u2014why didn't anybody notice?\n  \n \n  He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. \"Watch it!\" the\nman grated, \"Oh, it's you, Ed.\"\n  \n \n  Ed nodded dazedly. \"Hello, Jenkins.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. \"You look\nsick.\"\n  \n \n  \"The body. There in the park.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Ed.\" Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. \"Take it easy.\"\n  \n \n  Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. \"Something\nwrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed's not feeling well.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce yanked himself free. \"How can you stand here? Don't you see it?\nFor God's sake\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"What's he talking about?\" Margaret asked nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Ed shouted. \"The body hanging there!\"\n  \n \n  More people collected. \"Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?\"\n  \n \n  \"The body!\" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at\nhim. He tore loose. \"Let me go! The police! Get the police!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ed\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Better get a doctor!\"\n  \n \n  \"He must be sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"Or drunk.\"\n  \n \n  Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell.\nThrough a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men\nand women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them\ntoward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man,\nshowing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service\ncounter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically.\nHis voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.\n  \n \n  \"Do something!\" he screamed. \"Don't stand there! Do something!\nSomething's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!\"\n  \n \n  The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving\nefficiently toward Loyce.\n  \n"

Extensive research did not uncover\nany evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n Ed had always been a practical man, when he saw something was\nwrong he tried to correct it. Then one day he saw\n  \n  it\n  \n hanging in the\ntown square.\n  \n  Five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car\nout and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His\nback and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and\nwheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done\nokay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he\nliked the idea of repairing the foundations himself!\n  \n \n  It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying\ncommuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and\npackages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks\nand businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red\nlight and then started it up again. The store had been open without him;\nhe'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the\nrecords of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove\nslowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the\ntown park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND\nSERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again\nhe passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain\nand bench and single lamppost.\n  \n \n  From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle,\nswinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled\ndown his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of\nsome kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the\nsquare.\n  \n \n  Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park\nand concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a\ndisplay it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he\nswallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.\n  \n \n  It was a body. A human body.\n  \n<doc-sep>Feeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce\u2014he didn't stop to define it\u2014in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n  \n<doc-sep>He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body;\ntall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to\nmatch the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many\npeople who might find this one preferable. No identification in the\npockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it\nwas a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful\nstudent of the \"wanted\" fax that had decorated public buildings from\ntime immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he\nmight one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of\nthe men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though\nnot an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the\npolice had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital\npunishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the\nman in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily,\nnor whom the police intended to capture easily.\n  \n \n \n   This might be a lucky break for me after all\n   \n  , the new tenant thought,\nas he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious\nrude health, was not a very comfortable fit.\n   \n   I can do a lot with a\nhulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe\nI'll be able to get away with it.\n   \n \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"Look, Gabe,\" the girl said, \"don't try to fool me! I know you\ntoo well. And I know you have that man's\u2014the real Gabriel\nLockard's\u2014body.\" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she\nwatched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.\n  \n \n  Lockard\u2014Lockard's body, at any rate\u2014sat up and felt his unshaven\nchin. \"That what he tell you?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, he didn't tell me anything really\u2014just suggested I ask you\nwhatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he\nobviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to\nsee his body spoiled.\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   is\n   \n  a pretty good body, isn't it?\" Gabe flexed softening muscles\nand made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved\nat having someone with whom to share his secret.\n  \n \n  \"Not as good as it must have been,\" the girl said, turning and looking\nat him without admiration. \"Not if you keep on the way you're coursing.\nGabe, why don't you...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Give it back to him, eh?\" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly.\n\"You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd be\n   \n   his\n   \n  wife then. That would be\nnice\u2014a sound mind in a sound body. But don't you think that's a little\nmore than you deserve?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wasn't thinking about that, Gabe,\" she said truthfully enough, for\nshe hadn't followed the idea to its logical conclusion. \"Of course I'd\ngo with you,\" she went on, now knowing she lied, \"when you got your ...\nold body back.\"\n  \n \n \n   Sure\n   \n  , she thought,\n   \n   I'd keep going with you to farjeen houses and\nthrill-mills.\n   \n  Actually she had accompanied him to a thrill-mill only\nonce, and from then on, despite all his threats, she had refused to go\nwith him again. But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash\nthat experience from her mind or her body.\n  \n \n  \"You wouldn't be able to get your old body back, though, would you?\"\nshe went on. \"You don't know where it's gone, and neither, I suppose,\ndoes he?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't want to know!\" he spat. \"I wouldn't want it if I could get\nit back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he\nlooked in a mirror.\" He swung long legs over the side of his bed.\n\"Christ, anything would be better than that! You can't imagine what a\nhulk I had!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, I can,\" she said incautiously. \"You must have had a body to\nmatch your character. Pity you could only change one.\"\n  \n"

        "For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool\nof scummy water.\n  \n \n  They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the\nCity Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of\nsome kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest\u2014and then crawled\ncrab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.\n  \n \n  He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he\nshuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the\nCity Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of\nthe building and halting for a moment before going on.\n  \n \n  Were there more of them?\n  \n \n  It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm\nweren't men. They were alien\u2014from some other world, some other\ndimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the\nuniverse. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm\nof being.\n  \n \n  On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved\ntoward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter\nthe City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.\n  \n \n  Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight,\nclutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly\nfluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and\ncame to rest among them.\n  \n \n  Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves\nas men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration.\nMimicry.\n  \n \n  Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The\nalley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe\ndarkness made no difference to them.\n  \n \n  He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and\nwomen flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting\ngroups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the\nevening gloom.\n  \n \n  Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the\nbus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A\nmoment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  THE HANGING STRANGER\n  \n \n  BY PHILIP K.

He\nsaw that they were armed.\n  \n \n \n \n  He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced\nlizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been\nwatching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware\nof their danger.

A projection\nreached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the\nhour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer\ntold him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and\nthat the attack there had probably begun.\n  \n \n  The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay\nquietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow,\nthanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he\nwould not have to venture out into that miserable cold.\n  \n \n  Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with\nuncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was\ndistinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could\ntake no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single\nbutton, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling\nof the colonists' ship.\n  \n"

And their houses looked like pictures of\nNew England he'd seen in magazines.\n  \n \n  He rode on. He never did come to town. He came to a ten-foot fence with\na three-foot barbed-wire extension. He got off Plum and ripped his\nclothing climbing. He walked over hard-packed sand, and then wood,\nand came to a low metal railing. He looked out at the ocean, gleaming\nin bright sunlight, surging and seething endlessly. He felt the earth\nsway beneath him. He staggered, and dropped to his hands and knees, and\nshook his head like a fighter hit too many times. Then he got up and\nwent back to the fence and heard a sound. It was a familiar sound, yet\nstrange too. He shaded his eyes against the climbing sun. Then he saw\nit\u2014a car.\n   \n   A car!\n   \n \n<doc-sep>The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident\ninterest. He turned it over and studied the printing. \"United States of\nAmerica,\" he read aloud. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's the name of the country I come from,\" Jeff said carefully.\n\"I\u2014uh\u2014got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further\nthan I thought. What's the name of this place?\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you\nmust come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know\nabout this country.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Where'd you learn to speak\nFederal, if you come from so far?\"\n  \n \n  Jeff said helplessly, \"I can't explain, if you don't know about the\nUnited States. Listen, can you take me to a bank, or some place where\nthey know about foreign exchange?\"\n  \n \n  The policeman scowled. \"How'd you get into this country, anyway? You\ngot immigrate clearance?\"\n  \n \n  An angry muttering started among the bystanders.\n  \n \n  The policeman made up his mind. \"You come with me.\"\n  \n \n  At the police station, Jeff put his elbows dejectedly on the high\ncounter while the policeman talked to an officer in charge. Some men\nwhom Jeff took for reporters got up from a table and eased over to\nlisten.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know whether to charge them with fakemake, bumsy, peekage or\nlunate,\" the policeman said as he finished.\n  \n \n  His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.\n  \n \n  Jeff sighed. \"I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in\nsomething he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I\ndo\u2014more or less\u2014but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong\nin the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm\nso far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.\"\n  \n \n  There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.\n  \n \n  The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and\ngot answers which probably seemed stupid to him.\n  \n \n  The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. \"Come out, what are you\nadvertising?\" they kept asking. \"Who got you up to this?\"\n  \n \n  The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his\nwallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a \"Work License,\" which\nJeff took to be some sort of union card. Evidently there was grave\ndoubt that he had any legal right to be in the country.\n  \n \n  In the end, Jeff and Ann were locked in separate cells for the night.\nJeff groaned and pounded the bars as he thought of his wife, imprisoned\nand alone in a smelly jail. After hours of pacing the cell, he lay down\nin the cot and reached automatically for his silver pillbox. Then he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  In past weeks, his insomnia had grown worse and worse, so that lately\nhe had begun taking stronger pills. After a longing glance at the\nbig red and yellow capsules, he put the box away. Whatever tomorrow\nbrought, it wouldn't find him slow and drowsy.\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  He passed a wakeful night. In the early morning, he looked up to see a\nlittle man with a briefcase at his cell door.\n  \n \n  \"Wish joy, Mr. Elliott,\" the man said coolly. \"I am one of Mr. Bullen's\nbarmen. You know, represent at law? He sent me to arrange your release,\nif you are ready to be reasonable.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. \"I doubt if I'm\nready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?\"\n  \n \n  \"No problem. When we read in this morning's newspapers about a man\nclaiming to be a time traveler, we knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right. Now start explaining. Until I understand where I am, Bullen\nisn't getting me out of here.\"\n  \n \n  The lawyer smiled and sat down. \"Mr. Kersey told you yesterday\u2014you've\ngone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to\nunderstand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie\nfilm. A film never changes. Space does\u2014and time does. For example, if\na movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to\nfind a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil\nWar was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?\"\n  \n \n  \"If you go back to the time you call 1865\u2014which is most easily\ndone\u2014you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or\nthat war.\"\n  \n \n  Jeff looked blank. \"What are they doing then?\"\n  \n \n  The little man spread his hands. \"What are the people doing now at\nSixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day\nof the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you\ngrasp the difference between the two?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you\nspeak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space\u2014say, a lake\nin the mountains\u2014how do you identify that place? By looking for\nlandmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain\npeak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?\"\n  \n \n  \"So far. Keep talking.\"\n  \n"

He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n  \n \n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n  \n \n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n  \n \n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n  \n \n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars\neight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never\ngot back to Earth\u2014all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow,\nlike little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.\n  \n \n  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher\nthan any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The\nentire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills\nby erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one\nincredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it\nhad seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at\nEarth\u2014or a warning one.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n  \n \n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n  \n \n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n  \n \n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked toward the ugly red mound that jutted above the green. When\nthey came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains,\nactually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on\nwalking.\n  \n \n  \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that\nthere is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it,\neither, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is\ngiven an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the\nConquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had\nto.\"\n  \n \n  He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded\nhills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied\ntogether with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond\nthem were those from\n   \n   Mars V\n   \n  , too freshly dead to have decayed\nmuch ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and\nMarsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed\nto climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched\nout, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.\n  \n \n  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds,\nred elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve\nmiles from the ship\u2014horizontally.\n  \n \n  Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the\nfresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace\nbeside the canal.\n  \n \n  He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that\nother time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so\nmuch, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of\nHelene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently\nflowing water of the cool, green canal.\n  \n \n  \"You loved her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she\nwas young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd\nbeen older when they got her.\"\n  \n \n  He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the\nleaves floating down it.\n  \n \n  \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never\nseem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\nin the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n \n  He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm\ncity. He didn't look back.\n  \n \n  \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet\nI seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago.\nAre\u2014are the climbers still climbing\u2014somewhere, Helene?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe. I doubt if even the\nMartians have the answer to that.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the city.\n  \n \n"

You down there, all warm and cozy, reading poetry, darling.\nWhere you can see both ways instead of just up and down, up and down.\"\n  \n \n  He tried to imagine where she was now as he spoke to her, how she\nlooked. He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with\nMarsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of\nthat hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her,\nas he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren\nrocks.\n  \n \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,\n But down, my dear;\n And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley\n Will never seem fresh or clear\n For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\n In the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound\nof his own voice.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"\n  \n \n  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\"\nTerrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down?

And we'll go out and out, and\nwe'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're\ngoing up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the\ntop, Bruce!

The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n  \n \n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n  \n \n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning.

He thought of Earth and how it had been there, years ago, with\nMarsha. Things had seemed so different then. There was something of\nthat hope in his voice now as he spoke to her, yet not directly to her,\nas he looked out the window at the naked frigid sky and the barren\nrocks.\n  \n \"'... and there is nowhere to go from the top of a mountain,\n But down, my dear;\n And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley\n Will never seem fresh or clear\n For thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\n In the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n  The wind stormed over the shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound\nof his own voice.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, are you still there?\"\n  \n \n  \"What the devil's the idea, poetry at a time like this, or any time?\"\nTerrence demanded. \"Listen, you taking this down? We haven't run into\nany signs of the others. Six hundred thousand feet, Bruce! We feel our\ndestiny. We conquer the Solar System. And we'll go out and out, and\nwe'll climb the highest mountain, the highest mountain anywhere. We're\ngoing up and up. We've voted on it. Unanimous. We go on. On to the\ntop, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten years, a hundred, a\nthousand years, we'll find it. We'll find the top! Not the top of this\nworld\u2014the top of\n   \n   everything\n   \n  . The top of the\n  UNIVERSE\n  !\"\n  \n \n  Later, Terrence's voice broke off in the middle of something or\nother\u2014Bruce couldn't make any sense out of it at all\u2014and turned into\ncrazy yells that faded out and never came back.\n  \n \n  Bruce figured the others might still be climbing somewhere, or maybe\nthey were dead. Either way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He\nknew they would never come back down.\n  \n \n  He was switching off the radio for good when he saw the coloration\nbreak over the window. It was the same as the dream, but for an\ninstant, dream and reality seemed fused like two superimposed film\nnegatives.\n  \n \n  He went to the window and looked out. The comfortable little city was\nout there, and the canal flowing past through a pleasantly cool yet\nsunny afternoon. Purple mist blanketed the knees of low hills and there\nwas a valley, green and rich with the trees high and full beside the\nsoftly flowing canal water.\n  \n \n  The filmy shapes that seemed alive, that were partly translucent,\ndrifted along the water's edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass\nwavered down the wind.\n  \n \n  He opened the shelter door and went out. The shelter looked the same,\nbut useless now. How did the shelter of that bleak world get into this\none, where the air was warm and fragrant, where there was no cold, from\nthat world into this one of his dreams?\n  \n \n  The girl\u2014Helene\u2014was standing there leaning against a tree, smoking a\ncigarette.\n  \n \n  He walked toward her, and stopped. In the dream it had been easy, but\nnow he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy that had grown between\nthem. She wore the same casual slacks and sandals. Her hair was brown.\nShe was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to look at\nbecause she seemed so peaceful. Content, happy with what was and only\nwhat was.\n  \n \n  He turned quickly. The shelter was still there, and behind it the row\nof spaceships\u2014not like chalk marks on a tallyboard now, but like odd\nrelics that didn't belong there in the thick green grass. Five ships\ninstead of four.\n  \n \n  There was his own individual shelter beyond the headquarters building,\nand the other buildings. He looked up.\n  \n \n  There was no mountain.\n  \n<doc-sep>Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as\nlong as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.\n  \n \n  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were\nclimbing.\n  \n \n  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and\nthat's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the\nweaklings are.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher.\nTerrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What\na conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says,\nit's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but\nthat's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can\nsee what we are now. We can see how it's going to be\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he\nwas still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long\ntime passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking\nthe sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more\nreal each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.\n  \n \n  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but\nTerrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n  \n<doc-sep>The problem of where to put the line between dream and reality began to\nworry Bruce. He would wake up and listen and take down what Terrence\nwas saying, and then go to sleep again with increasing expectancy. His\ndream took on continuity. He could return to the point where he had\nleft it, and it was the same\u2014allowing even for the time difference\nnecessitated by his periods of sleep.\n  \n \n  He met people in the dreams, two girls and a man. They had names:\nPietro, Marlene, Helene.\n  \n \n  Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to\nhim all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could\nalso talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense.\nConsistently, they made sense.\n  \n \n  The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green\nvalleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing\ntheir branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there\nwere pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them\nthat were alive and intelligent and soft and warm and wonderful to know.\n  \n \n  '\n   \n   ... dreams, in their vivid coloring of life, as in that fleeting,\nshadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the\ndelirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love\u2014and all our\nown!\u2014than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known....\n   \n  '\n  \n \n  So sometimes he read poetry, but even that was hardly equal to the\ndreams.\n  \n \n  And then he would wake up and listen to Terrence's voice. He would\nlook out the window over the barren frigid land where there was nothing\nbut seams of worn land, like scabs under the brazen sky.\n  \n \n  \"If I had a choice,\" he thought, \"I wouldn't ever wake up at all again.\nThe dreams may not be more real, but they're preferable.\"\n  \n \n  Dreams were supposed to be wishful thinking, primarily, but he\ncouldn't live in them very long. His body would dry up and he would\ndie. He had to stay awake enough to put a little energy back into\nhimself. Of course, if he died and lost the dreams, there would be one\ncompensation\u2014he would also be free of Terrence and the rest of them\nwho had learned that the only value in life lay in killing one's way\nacross the Cosmos.\n  \n \n  But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him\nmuch more anyway. The voice was unreal, coming out of some void. He\ncould switch off Terrence any time now, but he was still curious.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014Bruce, you still there? Listen, we're up here at what we figure\nto be five hundred thousand feet! It\n   \n   is\n   \n  impossible. We keep climbing\nand now we look up and we can see up and up and there the mountain is\ngoing up and up\u2014\"\n  \n \n  And some time later: \"Bruce, Marsha's dying! We don't know what's the\nmatter. We can't find any reason for it. She's lying here and she keeps\nlaughing and calling your name. She's a woman, so that's probably it.\nWomen don't have real guts.\"\n  \n \n  Bruce bent toward the radio. Outside the shelter, the wind whistled\nsoftly at the door.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Bruce\u2014\"\n  \n \n  She hadn't said his name that way for a long time.\n  \n \n  \"Marsha, remember how we used to talk about human values? I remember\nhow you seemed to have something maybe different from the others. I\nnever thought you'd really buy this will to conquer, and now it doesn't\nmatter....\"\n  \n \n  He listened to her voice, first the crazy laughter, and then a whisper.\n\"Bruce, hello down there.\" Her voice was all mixed up with fear and\nhysteria and mockery. \"Bruce darling, are you lonely down there? I wish\nI were with you, safe ... free ... warm. I love you. Do you hear that?\nI really love you, after all. After all....\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Her voice drifted away, came back to him. \"We're climbing the highest\nmountain. What are you doing there, relaxing where it's peaceful and\nwarm and sane? You always were such a calm guy. I remember now. What\nare you doing\u2014reading poetry while we climb the mountain? What was\nthat, Bruce\u2014that one about the mountain you tried to quote to me last\nnight before you ... I can't remember it now. Darling, what...?\"\n  \n"

        " \n  THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  By BRYCE WALTON\n  \n \n  Illustrated by BOB HAYES\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction June 1952.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   First one up this tallest summit in the Solar\n    \n   System was a rotten egg ... a very rotten egg!\n   \n \n \n \n  Bruce heard their feet on the gravel outside and got up reluctantly to\nopen the door for them. He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd\nsneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing\noff, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be\npostponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of\nhuman beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all,\nbut seemed real and alive\u2014except that they were also just parts of a\nlast unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.\n  \n \n  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening\ntill the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He\nsmiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"\n  \n \n  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into\nBruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger\nin the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly\nat Bruce.\n  \n \n  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.\n  \n \n  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it.\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you\nthink I'd be running to?\"\n  \n \n  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.\n  \n \n  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care\nof that, doesn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the\nrevolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some\nsleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the\ngigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain\ndidn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars\neight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never\ngot back to Earth\u2014all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow,\nlike little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.\n  \n \n  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher\nthan any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The\nentire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills\nby erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one\nincredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it\nhad seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at\nEarth\u2014or a warning one.\n  \n<doc-sep>For one shivery moment he knew fear. And then the fear went away, and\nhe was ashamed of what he had felt. What he had feared was gone now,\nand he knew it was gone for good and he would never have to fear it\nagain.\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Bruce. I wondered how long it would take to get it through\nthat thick poetic head of yours!\"\n  \n \n  \"Get what?\" He began to suspect what it was all about now, but he\nwasn't quite sure yet.\n  \n \n  \"Smoke?\" she said.\n  \n \n  He took one of the cigarettes and she lighted it for him and put the\nlighter back into her pocket.\n  \n \n  \"It's real nice here,\" she said. \"Isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess it's about perfect.\"\n  \n \n  \"It'll be easy. Staying here, I mean. We won't be going to Earth ever\nagain, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't\n   \n   know\n   \n  that, but I didn't\n   \n   think\n   \n  we ever would again.\"\n  \n \n  \"We wouldn't want to anyway, would we, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"No.\"\n  \n \n  He kept on looking at the place where the mountain had been. Or maybe\nit still was; he couldn't make up his mind yet. Which was and which was\nnot? That barren icy world without life, or this?\n  \n \n  \"'\n   \n   Is all that we see or seem\n   \n  ,'\" he whispered, half to himself, \"'\n   \n   but\na dream within a dream?\n   \n  '\"\n  \n \n  She laughed softly. \"Poe was ahead of his time,\" she said. \"You still\ndon't get it, do you? You don't know what's been happening?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I don't.\"\n  \n \n  She shrugged, and looked in the direction of the ships. \"Poor guys. I\ncan't feel much hatred toward them now. The Martians give you a lot of\nunderstanding of the human mind\u2014after they've accepted you, and after\nyou've lived with them awhile. But the mountain climbers\u2014we can see\nnow\u2014it's just luck, chance, we weren't like them. A deviant is a child\nof chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Bruce said. \"There's a lot of people like us on Earth, but\nthey'll never get the chance\u2014the chance we seem to have here, to live\ndecently....\"\n  \n \n  \"You're beginning to see now which was the dream,\" she said and\nsmiled. \"But don't be pessimistic. Those people on Earth will get their\nchance, too, one of these fine days. The Conquerors aren't getting far.\nVenus, and then Mars, and Mars is where they stop. They'll keep coming\nhere and climbing the mountain and finally there won't be any more. It\nwon't take so long.\"\n  \n \n  She rose to her toes and waved and yelled. Bruce saw Pietro and Marlene\nwalking hand in hand up the other side of the canal. They waved back\nand called and then pushed off into the water in a small boat, and\ndrifted away and out of sight around a gentle turn.\n  \n \n  She took his arm and they walked along the canal toward where the\nmountain had been, or still was\u2014he didn't know.\n  \n \n  A quarter of a mile beyond the canal, he saw the high mound of red,\nnaked hill, corroded and ugly, rising up like a scar of the surrounding\ngreen.\n  \n \n  She wasn't smiling now. There were shadows on her face as the pressure\non his arm stopped him.\n  \n \n  \"I was on the first ship and Marlene on the second. None like us on the\nthird, and on the fourth ship was Pietro. All the others had to climb\nthe mountain\u2014\" She stopped talking for a moment, and then he felt the\npressure of her fingers on his arm. \"I'm very glad you came on the\nfifth,\" she whispered. \"Are you glad now?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm very glad,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The Martians tested us,\" she explained. \"They're masters of the mind.\nI guess they've been grinding along through the evolutionary mill\na darn long time, longer than we could estimate now. They learned\nthe horror we're capable of from the first ship\u2014the Conquerors,\nthe climbers. The Martians knew more like them would come and go on\ninto space, killing, destroying for no other reason than their own\nsickness. Being masters of the mind, the Martians are also capable\nof hypnosis\u2014no, that's not really the word, only the closest our\nlanguage comes to naming it. Suggestion so deep and strong that it\nseems real to one human or a million or a billion; there's no limit to\nthe number that can be influenced. What the people who came off those\nships saw wasn't real. It was partly what the Martians wanted them to\nsee and feel\u2014but most of it, like the desire to climb the mountain,\nwas as much a part of the Conquerors' own psychic drive as it was the\nsuggestion of the Martians.\"\n  \n \n  She waved her arm slowly to describe a peak. \"The Martians made the\nmountain real. So real that it could be seen from space, measured by\ninstruments ... even photographed and chipped for rock samples. But\nyou'll see how that was done, Bruce, and realize that this and not the\nmountain of the Conquerors is the reality of Mars. This is the Mars no\nConqueror will ever see.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of\nthe mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them\ndisappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like\nconvicts.\n  \n \n  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much\nif he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative\nprevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so\npleasant that he wouldn't wake up.

It's worth coming to Mars for\u2014to\naccept a challenge like this!\"\n  \n \n  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen\nmasks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness\nand we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I\ncan imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just\nto climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this!\nWhat a feeling of power, Bruce!\"\n  \n \n  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain\nat forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't\nseem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on\ngoing. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our\ncomputations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this\nhigh could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so\nsmooth.\"\n  \n \n  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice\nthat seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other\nfour ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any\nof them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food\nconcentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He\nhad only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to\ntake care of the time.\n  \n \n  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser\na few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most\ndependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether\nwe should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on\nclimbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused\nto accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled.\nSo I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning\nanti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for\nus in the future.

Terrence didn't seem real\nany more; certainly not as real as the dreams.\n  \n<doc-sep>They walked toward the ugly red mound that jutted above the green. When\nthey came close enough, he saw the bodies lying there ... the remains,\nactually, of what had once been bodies. He felt too sickened to go on\nwalking.\n  \n \n  \"It may seem cruel now,\" she said, \"but the Martians realized that\nthere is no cure for the will to conquer. There is no safety from it,\neither, as the people of Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is\ngiven an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the\nConquerors with a mountain. They themselves wanted to climb. They had\nto.\"\n  \n \n  He was hardly listening as he walked away from Helene toward the eroded\nhills. The crew members of the first four ships were skeletons tied\ntogether with imperishably strong rope about their waists. Far beyond\nthem were those from\n   \n   Mars V\n   \n  , too freshly dead to have decayed\nmuch ... Anhauser with his rope cut, a bullet in his head; Jacobs and\nMarsha and the others ... Terrence much past them all. He had managed\nto climb higher than anyone else and he lay with his arms stretched\nout, his fingers still clutching at rock outcroppings.\n  \n \n  The trail they left wound over the ground, chipped in places for holds,\nred elsewhere with blood from torn hands. Terrence was more than twelve\nmiles from the ship\u2014horizontally.\n  \n \n  Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, into the\nfresh fragrance of the high grass, and across it to the shade and peace\nbeside the canal.\n  \n \n  He put her down. She looked peaceful enough, more peaceful than that\nother time, years ago, when the two of them seemed to have shared so\nmuch, when the future had not yet destroyed her. He saw the shadow of\nHelene bend across Marsha's face against the background of the silently\nflowing water of the cool, green canal.\n  \n \n  \"You loved her?\"\n  \n \n  \"Once,\" Bruce said. \"She might have been sane. They got her when she\nwas young. Too young to fight. But she would have, I think, if she'd\nbeen older when they got her.\"\n  \n \n  He sat looking down at Marsha's face, and then at the water with the\nleaves floating down it.\n  \n \n  \"'... And the springs that flow on the floor of the valley will never\nseem fresh or clear for thinking of the glitter of the mountain water\nin the feathery green of the year....'\"\n  \n \n  He stood up, walked back with Helene along the canal toward the calm\ncity. He didn't look back.\n  \n \n  \"They've all been dead quite a while,\" Bruce said wonderingly. \"Yet\nI seemed to be hearing from Terrence until only a short time ago.\nAre\u2014are the climbers still climbing\u2014somewhere, Helene?\"\n  \n \n  \"Who knows?\" Helene answered softly. \"Maybe. I doubt if even the\nMartians have the answer to that.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the city.\n  \n \n<doc-sep>Terrence said, \"why did you shoot Doran?\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing me, and\nwhen he shot the\u2014\" Bruce hesitated.\n  \n \n  \"What? When he shot what?\"\n  \n \n  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to\nsharpen and rise to a kind of wail.\n  \n \n  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke\nme up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we\nwere supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of dreams?\"\n  \n \n  Someone laughed.\n  \n \n  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People\ntalk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some\nkind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"\n  \n \n  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.\n  \n \n  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of\nsome of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling\nthere's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out.\nYou're still interested?\"\n  \n \n  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.\n  \n \n  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce\npointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some\nfungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me\nfrom the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about\nscaling it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming\nto Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew\nof the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a\nprecedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why?\nBecause they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them?\nLike you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful\nclimb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up\nthere.\n  \n \n  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why\nshould I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The\nchallenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend\ngoing before something bigger than you are stops you\u2014it doesn't\ninterest me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up\nstraight and rigid.\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying,\nI woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was\nshaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either\nthat or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the\nwindow\u2014something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at\nfirst I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty,\nalmost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling\nit was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in\nmy mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking\u2014\"\n  \n \n  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked\nme what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked.\nThen I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too,\nor thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up\nhis rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran\nafter him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do\nyou know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I\ncould get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more.\nNeither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it.\nThat's the way you think.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? Explain that remark.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the philosophy of conquest\u2014don't take any chances with\naliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill\neverything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill\neverything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun\naway from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe\nthat's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and\nthat I had to kill him, so I did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would\nif I had the chance.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small\nwiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what\ndo you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit\nhim? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"\n  \n \n  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape.\n\"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia\nis caused by inner conflict\u2014indecision between the older values and\nour present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case\nhistory would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would\nsay that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why\nhe fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense\nwhich he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era\nvalues. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings\nof inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action?\nDoran must have seen something\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak\npersonality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He\n   \n   imagined\n   \n  he saw\nsomething.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did\n   \n   you\n   \n  see anything?\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't\nanything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there\nis to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything\nelse. A shadow maybe\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law\nregulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Execution.\"\n  \n \n  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you\na kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from\nyou, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left\nfood-concentrates to last a long time.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of service?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the\nmountain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"\n  \n \n  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the\nothers. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of\nus want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they\ncome in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"\n  \n"

        "He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n  \n \n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n  \n \n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n  \n \n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n  \n \n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n  \n \n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n  \n \n  Except it wouldn't be\n   \n   his\n   \n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n  \n \n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along\nthe top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve\nsteepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.\n  \n \n  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when\nhe'd followed.\n  \n \n  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would\nadmit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at\nevery downward look.

He had to talk fast.\n  \n \n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side.

But if there\n   \n   were\n   \n  a way over the bridge....\n  \n \n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me?

He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n  \n \n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n  \n \n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n  \n \n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n  \n \n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n  \n \n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n  \n \n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n  \n \n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  Bridge Crossing\n  \n \n  BY DAVE DRYFOOS\n  \n \n  Illustrated by HARRISON\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction May 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  He knew the city was organized for his\n   \n  individual defense, for it had been that\n   \n  way since he was born. But who was his enemy?\n  \n \n \n  In 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate was\nknown as fog. In 2149, it had become far more frequent, and was known\nas smog. By 2349, it was fog again.\n  \n \n  But tonight there was smoke mixed with the fog. Roddie could smell it.\nSomewhere in the forested ruins, fire was burning.\n  \n \n  He wasn't worried. The small blaze that smoldered behind him on the\ncracked concrete floor had consumed everything burnable within blocks;\nwhat remained of the gutted concrete office building from which he\npeered was fire-proof.\n  \n \n  But Roddie was himself aflame with anger. As always when Invaders broke\nin from the north, he'd been left behind with his nurse, Molly, while\nthe soldiers went out to fight.\n  \n \n  And nowadays Molly's presence wasn't the comfort it used to be. He felt\nalmost ready to jump out of his skin, the way she rocked and knitted in\nthat grating ruined chair, saying over and over again, \"The soldiers\ndon't\n   \n   want\n   \n  little boys. The soldiers don't\n   \n   want\n   \n  little boys. The\nsoldiers don't\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm\n   \n   not\n   \n  a little boy!\" Roddie suddenly shouted. \"I'm full-grown and\nI've never even\n   \n   seen\n   \n  an Invader. Why won't you let me go and fight?\"\n  \n \n  Fiercely he crossed the bare, gritty floor and shook Molly's shoulder.\nShe rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed the subject.\n  \n \n  \"A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, C is for Corpse\u2014\" she chanted.\n  \n \n  Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that had\nhelped her over these spells. But this time, though it stopped the\nkindergarten song, the treatment only started something worse.\n  \n \n  \"Wuzzums hungry?\" Molly cooed, still rocking.\n  \n \n  Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped her head off her neck.\n  \n \n  It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had\ncared for him and taught him speech and the alphabet hadn't made him a\nmechanic, and his only tool was a broken-handled screwdriver.\n  \n"

        "Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip.\nLimping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings\nthey looked out on a strange and isolated world.\n  \n \n  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount\nTamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy\nwhite sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons\non a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding,\ntallest of the peaks and most forbidding.\n  \n \n  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold\u2014of all the kinds of\ngold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small\nportion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed\nto have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its\ncolor.\n  \n \n  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no\ninterest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes,\nRoddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.\n  \n \n  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which\nInvaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins\nof the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable\nover the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was\nthe advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on\nthe water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need\nto kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.\n  \n \n  Roddie took the hammer from his waist.\n  \n \n  \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her\nface with scratched and bloodied hands.\n  \n \n  Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and,\nweeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends.\nIda's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.\n  \n \n  \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will\ncome back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so\nsenseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your\nfriends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men\u2014and the\ncity is ours, not theirs!\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   can't\n   \n  be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those\nwho are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to\nme. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be\naimless. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and\nend it by destroying it.\n   \n   My\n   \n  people must be the true Men, because\nthey're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to\nlet you escape.\"\n  \n \n  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.\n  \n \n  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in\ncold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two?\nDon't\u2014don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"\n  \n \n  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet\nsomehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said\nnothing.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind!\" Ida said viciously. \"You can't make me beg. Go ahead and\nkill\u2014see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the\ncity regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack\nfriends, too!

        "He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go. I\nbelong here!\"\n  \n \n  Ida gasped, twisted loose, and ran. Roddie ran after her.\n  \n \n  She wasn't so easily caught. Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended. Ida was\ntrapped.\n  \n \n  He could take his time. Let the soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly\nwould, to finish the job....\n  \n \n  But Ida didn't seem to realize she was trapped. Without hesitation she\ndashed up the main left-hand suspension cable and ran along its curved\nsteel surface.\n  \n \n  For a moment, Roddie thought of letting her go, letting her run up the\never-steepening catenary until\u2014because there were no guard-ropes or\nhandgrips\u2014she simply fell. That would solve his problem.\n  \n \n  Except it wouldn't be\n   \n   his\n   \n  solution. Her death wouldn't prove him to\nhis friends.\n  \n \n  He set out quickly, before Ida was lost to sight in the thick fog\nthat billowed in straight from the ocean. At first he ran erect along\nthe top of the yard-wide cylinder of twisted metal, but soon the curve\nsteepened. He had to go on all fours, clinging palm and sole.\n  \n \n  Blood was on the cable where she'd passed. More blood stained it when\nhe'd followed.\n  \n \n  But because his friends knew neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie would\nadmit none either. Nor would he give in to the fear that dizzied him at\nevery downward look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only\nhis holds, till he rammed Ida's rear with his head.\n  \n<doc-sep>\"I'd like to get a look at you,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The girl laughed self-consciously. \"It's getting gray out. You'll see\nme soon enough.\"\n  \n \n  But she'd see\n   \n   him\n   \n  , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.\n  \n \n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"\n  \n \n  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even\nher own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there\n   \n   were\n   \n  a way over the bridge....\n  \n \n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"\n  \n \n  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed\nher\u2014\n   \n   if\n   \n  nothing happened when she saw him.\n  \n \n  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.\n  \n \n  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first\nup the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old\nthing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n  \n \n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n  \n \n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n  \n \n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n  \n \n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n  \n \n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n  \n \n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n  \n \n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Roddie awoke as Ida finished struggling free of his unconscious grip.\nLimping, he joined her painful walk around the tower. From its openings\nthey looked out on a strange and isolated world.\n  \n \n  To the north, where Ida seemed drawn as though by instinct, Mount\nTamalpais reared its brushy head, a looming island above a billowy\nwhite sea of fog. To the south were the Twin Peaks, a pair of buttons\non a cotton sheet. Eastward lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding,\ntallest of the peaks and most forbidding.\n  \n \n  But westward over the ocean lay the land of gold\u2014of all the kinds of\ngold there are, from brightest yellow to deepest orange. Only a small\nportion of the setting sun glared above the fog-bank; the rest seemed\nto have been broken off and smeared around by a child in love with its\ncolor.\n  \n \n  Fascinated, Roddie stared for minutes, but turned when Ida showed no\ninterest. She was intent on the tower itself. Following her eyes,\nRoddie saw his duty made suddenly clear.\n  \n \n  Easy to make out even in the fading light was the route by which\nInvaders could cross to the foot of this tower on the remaining ruins\nof the road, climb to where he now stood, and then descend the cable\nover the bridge's gap and catch the city unaware. Easy to estimate was\nthe advantage of even this perilous route over things that scattered on\nthe water and prevented a landing in strength. Easy to see was the need\nto kill Ida before she carried home this knowledge.\n  \n \n  Roddie took the hammer from his waist.\n  \n \n  \"Don't! Oh, don't!\" Ida screamed. She burst into tears and covered her\nface with scratched and bloodied hands.\n  \n \n  Surprised, Roddie withheld the blow. He had wept, as a child, and,\nweeping, had for the first time learned he differed from his friends.\nIda's tears disturbed him, bringing unhappy memories.\n  \n \n  \"Why should you cry?\" he asked comfortingly. \"You know your people will\ncome back to avenge you and will destroy my friends.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\u2014but my people are your people, too,\" Ida wailed. \"It's so\nsenseless, now, after all our struggle to escape. Don't you see? Your\nfriends are only machines, built by our ancestors. We are Men\u2014and the\ncity is ours, not theirs!\"\n  \n \n  \"It\n   \n   can't\n   \n  be,\" Roddie objected. \"The city surely belongs to those\nwho are superior, and my friends are superior to your people, even to\nme. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  has a purpose, though, while you Invaders seem to be\naimless. Each of\n   \n   us\n   \n  helps preserve the city; you only try to rob and\nend it by destroying it.\n   \n   My\n   \n  people must be the true Men, because\nthey're so much more rational than yours.... And it isn't rational to\nlet you escape.\"\n  \n \n  Ida had turned up her tear-streaked face to stare at him.\n  \n \n  \"Rational! What's rational about murdering a defenseless girl in\ncold blood? Don't you realize we're the same sort of being, we two?\nDon't\u2014don't you remember how we've been with each other all day?\"\n  \n \n  She paused. Roddie noticed that her eyes were dark and frightened, yet\nsomehow soft, over scarlet cheeks. He had to look away. But he said\nnothing.\n  \n \n  \"Never mind!\" Ida said viciously. \"You can't make me beg. Go ahead and\nkill\u2014see if it proves you're superior. My people will take over the\ncity regardless of you and me, and regardless of your jumping-jack\nfriends, too! Men can accomplish anything!\"\n  \n"

        "Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist. Then, with weapon ready\nfor an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left hand through the\ndarkness. He touched something warm, softish. Gingerly he felt over\nthat curving surface for identifying features.\n  \n \n  While Roddie investigated by touch, his long fingers were suddenly\nseized and bitten. At the same time, his right shin received a savage\nkick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in mid-swing by an\nunexpected voice.\n  \n \n  \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" it whispered angrily. \"Who do you think\nyou are?\"\n  \n \n  Startled, he dropped his hammer. \"I'm Roddie,\" he said, squatting to\nfumble for it. \"Who do you think\n   \n   you\n   \n  are?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Ida, naturally! Just how many girls\n   \n   are\n   \n  there in this raiding\nparty?\"\n  \n \n  His first Invader\u2014and he had dropped his weapon!\n  \n \n  Scrabbling fearfully in the dust for his hammer, Roddie paused\nsuddenly. This girl\u2014whatever\n   \n   that\n   \n  was\u2014seemed to think him one of\nher own kind. There was a chance, not much, but worth taking, to turn\ndelay to advantage. Maybe he could learn something of value before he\nkilled her. That would make the soldiers accept him!\n  \n \n  He stalled, seeking a gambit. \"How would\n   \n   I\n   \n  know how many girls there\nare?\"\n  \n \n  Half expecting a blow, he got instead an apology. \"I'm sorry,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I should have known. Never even heard your name before, either.\nRoddie.... Whose boat did you come in, Roddie?\"\n  \n \n  Boat? What was a boat? \"How would I know?\" he repeated, voice tight\nwith fear of discovery.\n  \n \n  If she noticed the tension, she didn't show it. Certainly her whisper\nwas friendly enough. \"Oh, you're one of the fellows from Bodega, then.\nThey shoved a boy into our boat at the last minute, too. Tough, wasn't\nit, getting separated in the fog and tide like that? If only we didn't\nhave to use boats.... But, say, how are we going to get away from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't know,\" Roddie said, closing his fingers on the hammer, and\nrising. \"How did you get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"Followed your footprints. It was sundown and I saw human tracks in the\ndust and they led me here. Where were you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Scouting around,\" Roddie said vaguely. \"How did you know I was a man\nwhen I came back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because you couldn't see me, silly! You know perfectly well these\nandroids are heat-sensitive and can locate us in the dark!\"\n  \n \n  Indeed he did know! Many times he'd felt ashamed that Molly could find\nhim whenever she wanted to, even here in the manhole. But perhaps the\nmanhole would help him now to redeem himself....\n  \n<doc-sep>Roddie salvaged and returned Molly's needles. Then he examined the\npatient, tearing him apart as a boy dismembers an alarm clock.\n  \n \n  It was lucky he did. The left arm's pair of hands suddenly writhed off\nthe floor in an effort to choke him. But because the arm was detached\nat the shoulder and therefore blind, he escaped the clutching onslaught\nand could goad the reflexing hands into assaulting one another\nharmlessly.\n  \n \n \n  Meanwhile, the other soldiers left, except for one, apparently another\ncasualty, who stumbled on his way out and fell into the fire. By the\ntime Roddie had hauled him clear, damage was beyond repair. Roddie\nswore, then decided to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces\nof the other to make a whole one.\n  \n \n  To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie was\nnew at his work, and took it seriously. It alarmed him to watch the\nsoldiers melt away, gradually succumbing to battle damage, shamed\nhim to see the empty ruins burn section by section as the Invaders\nrepeatedly broke through and had to be burned out.\n  \n \n  Soon there would be nothing left of the\n   \n   Private Property Keep Out\n   \n  that, according to Molly's bedtime story, the Owners had entrusted to\nthem when driven away by radioactivity. Soon the soldiers themselves\nwould be gone. None would remain to guard the city but a few strayed\nservants like Molly, and an occasional Civil Defender.\n  \n \n  And himself, Roddie reflected, spitting savagely into the fire. He\nmight remain. But how he fitted into the picture, he didn't know. And\nMolly, who claimed to have found him in the ruins after a fight with\nInvaders twenty years before, couldn't or wouldn't say.\n  \n \n  Well, for as long as possible, Roddie decided, he'd do his duty as\nthe others did theirs\u2014single-mindedly. Eventually the soldiers might\naccept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first\naid was useful to them.\n  \n \n  He gave the fire a final poke and then paused, wondering if, when\nheated, his screwdriver could make an unfastened end of wire stick on\nthe grayish spot where it seemed to belong.\n  \n \n  Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he could try out his new\nidea, Roddie got too close to the flames. Instantly the room filled\nwith the stench of singed hair. Roddie drew angrily back, beating out\nthe sparks in his uncut blond mane.\n  \n \n  As he stood slapping his head and muttering, a deranged Civil Defense\nfirefighter popped into the doorway and covered him with carbon dioxide\nfoam.\n  \n \n  Roddie fled. His life-long friends were not merely wearing out, they\nwere unbearably wearing.\n  \n<doc-sep>He'd never gone as far as the bridge before, not having wanted to\nlook as if he might be leaving the city. The approach was a jungle of\nconcrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that reached for the\nunwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to balance on cracked\ngirders, and inch over roadless spots high off the ground.\n  \n \n  Here Ida took the lead. When they got to where three approach roads\nmade a clover-leaf, she led him down a side road and into a forest.\n  \n \n  Roddie stopped, and seized her arm.\n  \n \n  \"What are you trying to do?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm taking you with me,\" Ida said firmly. \"Taking you where you\nbelong!\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he blurted, drawing his hammer. \"I can't go, nor let you go.

Like a frightened doe, she dashed in and\nout among the trees, leaped to the bridge's underpinnings where they\nthrust rustedly from a cliff, and scrambled up the ramp.\n  \n \n  Roddie sighed and slowed down. The pavement ended just beyond the cable\nanchors. From there to the south tower, only an occasional dangling\nsupport wire showed where the actual bridge had been suspended.

        "When they started down the street, she was nervous despite Roddie's\nassertion that he knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if\nshe felt some of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, shared his visions of\nwhat the soldiers might do if they found him brazenly strolling with an\nInvader. They might not believe he was only questioning a prisoner.\n  \n \n  Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable.\n  \n \n  For that very reason, because he didn't know what precautions would do\nany good, he took a chance and walked openly to the bridge by the most\ndirect route. In time this apparent assurance stilled Ida's fears, and\nshe began to talk.\n  \n \n  Many of the things she said were beyond his experience and meaningless\nto him, but he did note with interest how effective the soldiers had\nbeen.\n  \n \n  \"It's awful,\" Ida said. \"So few young men are left, so many\ncasualties....\n  \n \n  \"But why do you\u2014we\u2014keep up the fight?\" Roddie asked. \"I mean, the\nsoldiers will never leave the city; their purpose is to guard it and\nthey\n   \n   can't\n   \n  leave, so they won't attack. Let them alone, and there'll\nbe plenty of young men.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" said Ida, sharply. \"You need indoctrination! Didn't they ever\ntell you that the city is our home, even if the stupid androids do keep\nus out? Don't you know how dependent we are on these raids for all our\ntools and things?\"\n  \n \n  She sounded suspicious. Roddie shot her a furtive, startled glance.\nBut she wasn't standing off to fight him. On the contrary, she was too\nclose for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and shoulder\nevery few steps, and if he edged away, she followed.\n  \n \n  He went on with his questioning. \"Why are\n   \n   you\n   \n  here? I mean, sure, the\nothers are after tools and things, but what's\n   \n   your\n   \n  purpose?\"\n  \n \n  Ida shrugged. \"I'll admit no girl has ever done it before,\" she said,\n\"but I thought I could help with the wounded. That's why I have no\nweapon.\"\n  \n \n  She hesitated, glanced covertly up at him, and went on with a rush of\nwords. \"It's the lack of men, I guess. All the girls are kind of bored\nand hopeless, so I got this bright idea and stowed away on one of the\nboats when it was dark and the fog had settled down. Do you think I was\nbeing silly?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, but you do seem a little purposeless.\"\n  \n \n  In silence they trudged through a vast area of charred wood and\nconcrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over\nthe water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore visibility was better, and they\ncould see the beginning of the bridge approach.\n  \n \n  A stone rattled nearby. There was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, and\nclung to Roddie's arm.\n  \n \n  \"Behind me!\" he whispered urgently. \"Get behind me and hold on!\"\n  \n \n  He felt Ida's arms encircling his waist, her chin digging into his back\nbelow the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, stood a\nsoldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.\n  \n \n \n  \"It's all right,\" Roddie said, his voice breaking.\n  \n \n  There was a long, sullen, heart-stopping stare. Then the soldier turned\nand walked away.\n  \n \n  Ida's grip loosened, and he could feel her sag behind him. Roddie\nturned and held her. With eyes closed, she pressed cold blue lips to\nhis. He grimaced and turned away his head.\n  \n \n  Ida's response was quick. \"Forgive me,\" she breathed, and slipped from\nhis arms, but she held herself erect. \"I was so scared. And then we've\nhad no sleep, no food or water.\"\n  \n \n  Roddie was familiar with these signs of weakness, proud of appearing to\ndeny his own humiliating needs.\n  \n \n  \"I guess you're not as strong as me,\" he said smugly. \"I'll take care\nof you. Of course we can't sleep now, but I'll get food and water.\"\n  \n \n  Leaving her to follow, he turned left to the ruins of a supermarket he\nhad previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by setting\na pace Ida couldn't match. By the time she caught up with him, he had\ngrubbed out a few cans of the special size that Molly always chose.\nPicking two that were neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, he smashed\nan end of each with his hammer, and gave Ida her choice of strained\nspinach or squash.\n  \n \n  \"Baby food!\" she muttered. \"Maybe it's just what we need, but to eat\nbaby food with a man wearing a diaper.... Tell me, Roddie, how did you\nhappen to know where to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, this is the northern end of the city,\" he answered, shrugging.\n\"I've been here before.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why did the soldier let us go?\"\n  \n \n  \"This watch,\" he said, touching the radium dial. \"It's a talisman.\"\n  \n \n  But Ida's eyes had widened, and the color was gone from her face. She\nwas silent, too, except when asking him to fill his fast-emptied can\nwith rain-water. She didn't finish her own portion, but lay back in the\nrubble with feet higher than her head, obviously trying to renew her\nstrength.\n  \n \n  And when they resumed their walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face showed\nplainly that he'd given himself away.\n  \n \n  But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the\nsupposedly impassable bridge, seemed as purposeless and impulsive as\nIda herself. Roddie didn't think, in any case, that her death would\nsatisfy the soldiers. With new and useful information to offer, he\nmight join them as an equal at last. But if his dalliance with this\nenemy seemed pointless, not even Molly's knitting needles could protect\nhim.\n  \n \n  He was sure the soldiers must be tracking the mysterious emanations of\nhis watch dial, and had trouble to keep from glancing over his shoulder\nat every step. But arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for\nthis self-restraint. Here, difficult going demanded full attention.\n  \n<doc-sep>Quickly, Roddie drew the hammer from his waist.

You'll see\nme soon enough.\"\n  \n \n  But she'd see\n   \n   him\n   \n  , Roddie realized. He had to talk fast.\n  \n \n  \"What'll we do when it's light?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess the boats have gone,\" Ida said. \"You could swim the\nGate, I guess\u2014you seem tall and strong enough. But I couldn't. You'll\nthink it's crazy, but I've given this some thought, and even looked it\nover from the other side. I expect to try the Golden Gate Bridge!\"\n  \n \n  Now he was getting somewhere! The bridge was ruined, impassable. Even\nher own people had crossed the Strait by other means. But if there\n   \n   were\n   \n  a way over the bridge....\n  \n \n  \"It's broken,\" he said. \"How in the world can we cross it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll find out, if you take me up there. I\u2014I don't want to be\nalone, Roddie. Will you go with me? Now?\"\n  \n \n  Well, she could be made to point out the route before he killed\nher\u2014\n   \n   if\n   \n  nothing happened when she saw him.\n  \n \n  Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand.\n  \n \n  A giggle broke the pause. \"It's nice of you to wait and let me go first\nup the ladder,\" the girl said. \"But where the heck is the rusty old\nthing?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll go first,\" said Roddie. He might need the advantage. \"The\nladder's right behind me.\"\n  \n \n  He climbed with hammer in teeth, and stretched his left hand from\nstreet level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously\nfingering his weapon, he stared at her in the thin gray dawn.\n  \n \n  She was short and lean, except for roundnesses here and there. From her\nshapeless doeskin dress stretched slender legs that tapered to feet\nthat were bare, tiny, and, like her hands, only two in number.\n  \n \n  Roddie was pleased. They were evenly matched as to members, and that\nwould make things easy when the time came.\n  \n \n  He looked into her face. It smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, with a\nfull mouth and bright dark eyes that hid under long lashes when he\nlooked too long.\n  \n \n  Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a rush of\nfear, but she gave his hand a squeeze before twisting loose, and burst\ninto sudden laughter.\n  \n \n  \"Diapers!\" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. \"My big,\nstrong, blond and blue-eyed hero goes into battle wearing diapers, and\ncarrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most unforgettable\ncharacter I have ever known!\"\n  \n \n  He'd passed inspection, then\u2014so far. He expelled his withheld breath,\nand said, \"I think you'll find me a little odd, in some ways.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all,\" Ida replied quickly. \"Different, yes, but I wouldn't\nsay odd.\"\n  \n"

Black Edmund, masking a deep uncertainty with a strong\nshow of decisiveness.\n  \n \n  In short, her family. She knew their every quirk and foible. And yet\nnow they seemed to her a million miles away, figures seen through the\nwrong end of a telescope.\n  \n \n  Were they really a family?

Butterflies taking advantage of good weather to\nwing together in a glamorous, artificial dance\u2014until outraged Nature\ndecided to wipe them out?\n  \n \n  As the poem was ending, Celeste saw the door open and Rosalind come\nslowly in.

Whatever was on her mind prevented even that incredible\nstatement from penetrating.\n  \n \n  She walked shakily to the table and put down a briefcase, one end of\nwhich was smudged with dirt.\n  \n \n  Without looking at them, she said, \"Ivan left the Deep Space Bar\ntwenty minutes ago, said he was coming straight here.

No!\nPlease, no!\"\n  \n \n  Celeste's reactions were mixed. She felt worried about Dotty and at\nthe same time almost in terror of her, as if the little girl were an\nagent of supernatural forces. She told herself that this fear was an\nexpression of her own hostility, yet she didn't really believe it. She\ntouched the child's hand.\n  \n \n  Dotty's eyes opened without making Celeste feel she had quite come\nawake. After a bit she looked at Celeste and her little lips parted in\na smile.\n  \n \n  \"Hello,\" she said sleepily. \"I've been having such funny dreams.\" Then,\nafter a pause, frowning, \"I really am a god, you know. It feels very\nqueer.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, dear?\" Celeste prompted uneasily. \"Shall I call Frieda?\"\n  \n \n  The smile left Dotty's lips. \"Why do you act so nervous around me?\" she\nasked. \"Don't you love me, Mummy?\"\n  \n \n  Celeste started at the word. Her throat closed. Then, very slowly, her\nface broke into a radiant smile. \"Of course I do, darling. I love you\nvery much.\"\n  \n \n  Dotty nodded happily, her eyes already closed again.\n  \n \n  There was a sudden flurry of excited voices beyond the door. Celeste\nheard her name called. She stood up.\n  \n \n  \"I'm going to have to go out and talk with the others,\" she said. \"If\nyou want me, dear, just call.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, Mummy.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Frieda collapsed to a chair, trembling between laughter and hysterical\nweeping. Theodor looked as blank as Dotty had while waiting for words\nto speak. Edmund sprang to the picture window, Celeste toward the TV\nset.\n  \n \n  Climbing shakily out of the chair, Frieda stumbled to the picture\nwindow and peered out beside Edmund. She saw lights bobbing along the\npaths with a wild excitement.\n  \n \n  On the TV screen, Celeste watched two brightly lit ships spinning in\nthe sky\u2014whether human spaceships or Phobos and Deimos come to help\nEarth rejoice, she couldn't tell.\n  \n \n  Dotty spoke again, the joy in her strange voice forcing them to turn.\n\"And you, dear children, creatures of our camouflage, we welcome\nyou\u2014whatever your future career on these planets or like ones\u2014into\nthe society of enlightened worlds! You need not feel small and alone\nand helpless ever again, for we shall always be with you!\"\n  \n \n  The outer door opened. Ivan and Rosalind reeled in, drunkenly smiling,\narm in arm.\n  \n \n  \"Like rockets,\" Rosalind blurted happily. \"We came through the\ndurasphere and solid rock ... shot up right to the surface.\"\n  \n \n  \"They didn't have to take us along,\" Ivan added with a bleary grin.\n\"But you know that already, don't you? They're too good to let you live\nin fear, so they must have told you by now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, we know,\" said Theodor. \"They must be almost godlike in their\ngoodness. I feel ... calm.\"\n  \n \n  Edmund nodded soberly. \"Calmer than I ever felt before. It's knowing, I\nsuppose, that\u2014well, we're not alone.\"\n  \n \n  Dotty blinked and looked around and smiled at them all with a wholly\nlittle-girl smile.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Mummy,\" she said, and it was impossible to tell whether she spoke\nto Frieda or Rosalind or Celeste, \"I've just had the funniest dream.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, darling,\" said Rosalind gently, \"it's we who had the dream. We've\njust awakened.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Looking at the lovely garden landscape around her, Celeste Wolver felt\nthat in a moment the shrubby hills would begin to roll like waves, the\ncharmingly aimless paths twist like snakes and sink in the green sea,\nthe sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds they\npierced.\n  \n \n \n   People must have felt like this\n   \n  , she thought,\n   \n   when Aristarches first\nhinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feet\nwas falling dizzily through space. Only it's worse for us, because they\ncouldn't see that anything had changed. We can.\n   \n \n \n  \"You need something to cling to,\" she heard Madge say. \"Dr. Kometevsky\nwas the only person who ever had an inkling that anything like this\nmight happen. I was never a Kometevskyite before. Hadn't even heard of\nthe man.\"\n  \n \n  She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so frank and\nanxious-eyed, Madge looked anything but a fanatic, which made it much\nworse.\n  \n \n  \"Of course, there are several more convincing alternate\nexplanations....\" Theodor began hesitantly, knowing very well that\nthere weren't. If Phobos and Deimos had suddenly disintegrated,\nsurely Mars Base would have noticed something. Of course there was the\nDisordered Space Hypothesis, even if it was little more than the chance\nphrase of a prominent physicist pounded upon by an eager journalist.\nAnd in any case, what sense of security were you left with if you\nadmitted that moons and planets might explode, or drop through unseen\nholes in space? So he ended up by taking a different tack: \"Besides, if\nPhobos and Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they'd have been\npicked up by now by 'scope or radar.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two balls of rock just a few miles in diameter?\" Madge questioned.\n\"Aren't they smaller than many of the asteroids? I'm no astronomer, but\nI think' I'm right.\"\n  \n \n  And of course she was.\n  \n \n  She swung the book under her arm. \"Whew, it's heavy,\" she observed,\nadding in slightly scandalized tones, \"Never been microfilmed.\" She\nsmiled nervously and looked them up and down. \"Going to a party?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  Theodor's scarlet cloak and Celeste's green culottes and silver jacket\njustified the question, but they shook their heads.\n  \n \n  \"Just the normally flamboyant garb of the family,\" Celeste said,\nwhile Theodor explained, \"As it happens, we're bound on business\nconnected with the disappearance. We Wolvers practically constitute\na sub-committee of the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes.\nAnd since a lot of varied material comes to our attention, we're\ngoing to see if any of it correlates with this bit of astronomical\nsleight-of-hand.\"\n  \n \n  Madge nodded. \"Give you something to do, at any rate. Well, I must be\noff. The Buddhist temple has lent us their place for a meeting.\" She\ngave them a woeful grin. \"See you when the Earth jumps.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor said to Celeste, \"Come on, dear. We'll be late.\"\n  \n \n  But Celeste didn't want to move too fast. \"You know, Teddy,\" she said\nuncomfortably, \"all this reminds me of those old myths where too much\ngood fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster. It was just too much\nluck, our great-grandparents missing World III and getting the World\nGovernment started a thousand years ahead of schedule. Luck like that\ncouldn't last, evidently. Maybe we've gone too fast with a lot of\nthings, like space-flight and the Deep Shaft and\u2014\" she hesitated a\nbit\u2014\"complex marriages. I'm a woman. I want complete security. Where\nam I to find it?\"\n  \n \n  \"In me,\" Theodor said promptly.\n  \n \n  \"In you?\" Celeste questioned, walking slowly. \"But you're just\none-third of my husband. Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or\nIvan.\"\n  \n \n  \"You angry with me about something?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. But a woman wants her source of security whole. In a\ncrisis like this, it's disturbing to have it divided.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we are a whole and, I believe, indivisible family,\" Theodor\ntold her warmly. \"You're not suggesting, are you, that we're going to\nbe punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from\nHeaven and all that?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly. I just wanted to give you a picture of my feeling.\"\nCeleste smiled. \"I guess none of us realized how much we've come to\ndepend on the idea of unchanging scientific law. Knocks the props from\nunder you.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor nodded emphatically. \"All the more reason to get a line on\nwhat's happening as quickly as possible. You know, it's fantastically\nfar-fetched, but I think the experience of persons with Extra-Sensory\nPerception may give us a clue. During the past three or four days\nthere's been a remarkable similarity in the dreams of ESPs all over the\nplanet. I'm going to present the evidence at the meeting.\"\n  \n \n  Celeste looked up at him. \"So that's why Rosalind's bringing Frieda's\ndaughter?\"\n  \n \n  \"Dotty is your daughter, too, and Rosalind's,\" Theodor reminded her.\n  \n \n  \"No, just Frieda's,\" Celeste said bitterly. \"Of course you may be the\nfather. One-third of a chance.\"\n  \n \n  Theodor looked at her sharply, but didn't comment. \"Anyway, Dotty will\nbe there,\" he said. \"Probably asleep by now. All the ESPs have suddenly\nseemed to need more sleep.\"\n  \n \n  As they talked, it had been growing darker, though the luminescence of\nthe path kept it from being bothersome. And now the cloud rack parted\nto the east, showing a single red planet low on the horizon.\n  \n \n  \"Did you know,\" Theodor said suddenly, \"that in\n   \n   Gulliver's Travels\n   \n  Dean Swift predicted that better telescopes would show Mars to have two\nmoons? He got the sizes and distances and periods damned accurately,\ntoo. One of the few really startling coincidences of reality and\nliterature.\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop being eerie,\" Celeste said sharply. But then she went on, \"Those\nnames Phobos and Deimos\u2014they're Greek, aren't they? What do they mean?\"\n  \n \n  Theodor lost a step. \"Fear and Terror,\" he said unwillingly. \"Now\ndon't go taking that for an omen. Most of the mythological names of\nmajor and minor ancient gods had been taken\u2014the bodies in the Solar\nSystem are named that way, of course\u2014and these were about all that\nwere available.\"\n  \n \n  It was true, but it didn't comfort him much.\n  \n"

        "As Celeste and Theodor entered the committee room, Rosalind Wolver\u2014a\nglitter of platinum against darkness\u2014came in through the opposite\ndoor and softly shut it behind her. Frieda, a fair woman in blue robes,\ngot up from the round table.\n  \n \n  Celeste turned away with outward casualness as Theodor kissed his two\nother wives. She was pleased to note that Edmund seemed impatient too.\nA figure in close-fitting black, unrelieved except for two red arrows\nat the collar, he struck her as embodying very properly the serious,\nfateful temper of the moment.\n  \n \n  He took two briefcases from his vest pocket and tossed them down on the\ntable beside one of the microfilm projectors.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get started without waiting for Ivan,\" he said.\n  \n \n  Frieda frowned anxiously. \"It's ten minutes since he phoned from the\nDeep Space Bar to say he was starting right away. And that's hardly a\ntwo minutes walk.\"\n  \n \n  Rosalind instantly started toward the outside door.\n  \n \n  \"I'll check,\" she explained. \"Oh, Frieda, I've set the mike so you'll\nhear if Dotty calls.\"\n  \n \n  Edmund threw up his hands. \"Very well, then,\" he said and walked over,\nswitched on the picture and stared out moodily.\n  \n \n  Theodor and Frieda got out their briefcases, switched on projectors,\nand began silently checking through their material.\n  \n \n  Celeste fiddled with the TV and got a newscast. But she found her eyes\ndidn't want to absorb the blocks of print that rather swiftly succeeded\neach other, so, after a few moments, she shrugged impatiently and\nswitched to audio.\n  \n \n  At the noise, the others looked around at her with surprise and some\nirritation, but in a few moments they were also listening.\n  \n \n  \"The two rocket ships sent out from Mars Base to explore the orbital\npositions of Phobos and Deimos\u2014that is, the volume of space they'd be\noccupying if their positions had remained normal\u2014report finding masses\nof dust and larger debris. The two masses of fine debris are moving\nin the same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanished\nmoons, and occupy roughly the same volumes of space, though the mass\nof material is hardly a hundredth that of the moons. Physicists have\nventured no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation of\nthe Disintegration Hypothesis.\n  \n \n  \"However, we're mighty pleased at this news here. There's a marked\nlessening of tension. The finding of the debris\u2014solid, tangible\nstuff\u2014seems to lift the whole affair out of the supernatural miasma in\nwhich some of us have been tempted to plunge it. One-hundredth of the\nmoons has been found.\n  \n \n  \"The rest will also be!\"\n  \n \n  Edmund had turned his back on the window. Frieda and Theodor had\nswitched off their projectors.\n  \n \n  \"Meanwhile, Earthlings are going about their business with a minimum\nof commotion, meeting with considerable calm the strange threat to\nthe fabric of their Solar System. Many, of course, are assembled in\nchurches and humanist temples. Kometevskyites have staged helicopter\nprocessions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demanding\nthat instant preparations be made for\u2014and I quote\u2014'Earth's coming\nleap through space.' They have also formally challenged all astronomers\nto produce an explanation other than the one contained in that strange\nbook so recently conjured from oblivion,\n   \n   The Dance of the Planets\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"That about winds up the story for the present. There are no new\nreports from Interplanetary Radar, Astronomy, or the other rocket ships\nsearching in the extended Mars volume. Nor have any statements been\nissued by the various groups working on the problem in Astrophysics,\nCosmic Ecology, the Congress for the Discovery of New Purposes, and so\nforth. Meanwhile, however, we can take courage from the words of a poem\nwritten even before Dr. Kometevsky's book:\n  \n \"This Earth is not the steadfast place\n We landsmen build upon;\n From deep to deep she varies pace,\n And while she comes is gone.\n Beneath my feet I feel\n Her smooth bulk heave and dip;\n With velvet plunge and soft upreel\n She swings and steadies to her keel\n Like a gallant, gallant ship.\"\n <doc-sep>While the TV voice intoned the poem, growing richer as emotion caught\nit up, Celeste looked around her at the others. Frieda, with her\ntouch of feminine helplessness showing more than ever through her\nbusiness-like poise. Theodor leaning forward from his scarlet cloak\nthrown back, smiling the half-smile with which he seemed to face even\nthe unknown. Black Edmund, masking a deep uncertainty with a strong\nshow of decisiveness.\n  \n \n  In short, her family. She knew their every quirk and foible. And yet\nnow they seemed to her a million miles away, figures seen through the\nwrong end of a telescope.\n  \n \n  Were they really a family? Strong sources of mutual strength and\nsecurity to each other? Or had they merely been playing family,\nexperimenting with their notions of complex marriage like a bunch of\nsilly adolescents? Butterflies taking advantage of good weather to\nwing together in a glamorous, artificial dance\u2014until outraged Nature\ndecided to wipe them out?\n  \n \n  As the poem was ending, Celeste saw the door open and Rosalind come\nslowly in. The Golden Woman's face was white as the paths she had been\ntreading.\n  \n \n  Just then the TV voice quickened with shock. \"News! Lunar Observatory\nOne reports that, although Jupiter is just about to pass behind the\nSun, a good coronagraph of the planet has been obtained. Checked and\nrechecked, it admits of only one interpretation, which Lunar One\nfeels duty-bound to release.\n   \n   Jupiter's fourteen moons are no longer\nvisible!\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The chorus of remarks with which the Wolvers would otherwise have\nreceived this was checked by one thing: the fact that Rosalind seemed\nnot to hear it. Whatever was on her mind prevented even that incredible\nstatement from penetrating.\n  \n \n  She walked shakily to the table and put down a briefcase, one end of\nwhich was smudged with dirt.\n  \n \n  Without looking at them, she said, \"Ivan left the Deep Space Bar\ntwenty minutes ago, said he was coming straight here. On my way back\nI searched the path. Midway I found this half-buried in the dirt. I\nhad to tug to get it out\u2014almost as if it had been cemented into the\nground. Do you feel how the dirt seems to be\n   \n   in\n   \n  the leather, as if\nit had lain for years in the grave?\"\n  \n \n  By now the others were fingering the small case of microfilms they had\nseen so many times in Ivan's competent hands. What Rosalind said was\ntrue. It had a gritty, unwholesome feel to it. Also, it felt strangely\nheavy.\n  \n \n  \"And see what's written on it,\" she added.\n  \n \n  They turned it over. Scrawled with white pencil in big, hasty, frantic\nletters were two words:\n  \n \n  \"Going down!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Looking at the lovely garden landscape around her, Celeste Wolver felt\nthat in a moment the shrubby hills would begin to roll like waves, the\ncharmingly aimless paths twist like snakes and sink in the green sea,\nthe sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds they\npierced.\n  \n \n \n   People must have felt like this\n   \n  , she thought,\n   \n   when Aristarches first\nhinted and Copernicus told them that the solid Earth under their feet\nwas falling dizzily through space.

        "Forty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The\nairmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of\nthe alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched\nand yawned and worried. An alert! The older kids fussed and complained\nand their mothers shut them up. No, there wasn't any alert scheduled\nfor tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids\ncouldn't get up yet\u2014it was the middle of the night.\n  \n \n  And as soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers\nstruggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing\narea to hear.\n  \n \n  They caught the words from a distance\u2014not quite correctly. \"Riot!\"\ngasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I\n   \n   told\n   \n  Charlie they'd get out of hand and\u2014Alys, we aren't safe. You\nknow how they are about GI women! I'm going right home and get a club\nand stand right by the door and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Club!\" snapped Alys, radarscope-sergeant, with two children\nquerulously awake in her nursery at home. \"What in God's name is the\nuse of a club? You can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head. You'd\nbetter come along to Supply with me and draw a gun\u2014you'll need it\nbefore this night is over.\"\n  \n \n  But the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the\nscramble-call speakers, and they knew it was not merely a matter of\ntrouble in the wipe quarters. The Jug! The governor himself had called\nthem out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such\nlevels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison.\n  \n \n  The rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a\nwhistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they\nwere the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up\ntheir picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers\nin each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below.\n  \n \n  They were ready for the breakout.\n  \n \n  But there wasn't any breakout.\n  \n \n  The rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The\nhelicopters hung on\u2014still ready, still waiting.\n  \n \n  The rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again.\nThey stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed.\nThe prison below them was washed with light\u2014from the guard posts on\nthe walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of\nthe guard squadrons surrounding the walls.\n  \n \n  North of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed\nland, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed\nlights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion\nfrom their undesired neighbors to the east, the wipes. In the crowded\ntenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to\nwindow; and there were crowds in the bright streets.\n  \n \n  \"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier\nyelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the\nwhirling blades. \"Look at the mobs in Greaserville! The first breakout\nfrom the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be\nright in the middle of it!\"\n  \n \n  He was partly right. He would be right in the middle of it\u2014for every\nman, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of\nit. There was no place anywhere that would be spared.\n   \n   No mixing.\n   \n  That\nwas the prescription that kept the city-state alive. There's no harm in\na family fight\u2014and aren't all mechanics a family, aren't all laborers\na clan, aren't all clerks and office workers related by closer ties\nthan blood or skin?\n  \n \n  But the declassed cons of the Jug were the dregs of every class; and\nonce they spread, the neat compartmentation of society was pierced. The\nbreakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever\nknown.\n  \n \n  But he was also partly wrong. Because the breakout wasn't seeming to\ncome.\n  \n<doc-sep>It was night. The city had been lost beyond the dead mounds of Earth\nthat rolled away behind them, like a thousand ancient tombs. The\nground car sat still on a crumbling road.\n  \n \n  Looking up through the car's driving blister, they saw the stars sunk\ninto the blue black ocean of space; saw the path of the Milky Way\nalong which they had rushed, while they had been searching frantically\nfor the place of salvation.\n  \n \n  \"If any one of the other couples had made it back,\" said Mary, \"do you\nthink they'd be with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"I think they'd either be with us,\" he said, \"or out in space\nagain\u2014or in prison.\"\n  \n \n  She stared ahead along the beam of headlight that stabbed out into the\nnight over the decaying road.\n  \n \n  \"How sorry are you,\" she said quietly, \"coming with me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know is, if I were out in space for long without you, I'd kill\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are we going to die out here, Michael?\" she said, gesturing toward\nthe wall of night that stood at the end of the headlight, \"with the\nland?\"\n  \n \n  He turned from her, frowning, and drove the ground car forward,\nwatching the headlights push back the darkness.\n  \n \n  They followed the crumbling highway all night until light crept across\nthe bald and cracked hills. The morning sun looked down upon the\ndesolation ten feet above the horizon when the car stopped. They sat\nfor a long time then, looking out upon the Earth's parched and\ninflamed skin. In the distance a wall of mountains rose like a great\npile of bleached bones. Close ahead the rolling plains were motionless\nwaves of dead Earth with a slight breeze stirring up little swirls of\ndust.\n  \n \n  \"I'm getting out,\" she said.\n  \n \n  \"I haven't the slightest idea how much farther to go, or why,\" said\nMichael shrugging. \"It's all the same. Dirt and hills and mountains\nand sun and dust. It's really not much different from being out in\nspace. We live in the car just like in a space ship. We've enough\nconcentrated supplies to last for a year. How far do we go? Why?\nWhen?\"\n  \n \n  They stepped upon the Earth and felt the warmth of the sun and\nstrolled toward the top of the hill.\n  \n \n  \"The air smells clean,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The ground feels good. I think I'll take off my shoes.\" She did.\n\"Take off your boots, Michael. Try it.\"\n  \n \n  Wearily he pulled off his boots, stood in his bare feet. \"It takes me\nback.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" she said and began walking toward the hilltop.\n  \n \n  He followed, his boots slung around his neck. \"There was a road\nsomewhere, with the dust between my toes. Or was it a dream?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess when the past is old enough,\" she said, \"it becomes a dream.\"\n  \n \n  He watched her footprints in the dust. \"God, listen to the quiet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't seem to remember so much quiet around me. There's always been\nthe sound of a space ship, or the pumps back in the cities.\"\n  \n \n  He did not answer but continued to watch her footsteps and to feel the\ndust squishing up between his toes. Then suddenly:\n  \n \n  \"Mary!\"\n  \n \n  She stopped, whirling around.\n  \n \n  He was staring down at her feet.\n  \n \n  She followed his gaze.\n  \n \n  \"It's grass!\" He bent down. \"Three blades.\"\n  \n \n  She knelt beside him. They touched the green blades.\n  \n \n  \"They're new,\" he said.\n  \n \n  They stared, like religious devotees concentrating upon some sacred\nobject.\n  \n \n  He rose, pulling her up with him. They hurried to the top of the hill\nand stood very still, looking down into a valley. There were tiny\npatches of green and little trees sprouting, and here and there, a\npale flower. The green was in a cluster, in the center of the valley\nand there was a tiny glint of sunlight in its center.\n  \n \n  \"Oh!\"\n  \n \n  Her hand found his.\n  \n \n  They ran down the gentle slope, feeling the patches of green touch\ntheir feet, smelling a new freshness in the air. And coming to the\nlittle spring, they stood beside it and watched the crystal water that\ntrickled along the valley floor and lost itself around a bend. They\nsaw a furry, little animal scurry away and heard the twitter of a bird\nand saw it resting on a slim, bending branch. They heard the buzz of a\nbee, saw it light on a pale flower at their feet and work at the\nsweetness inside.\n  \n \n  Mary knelt down and drank from the spring.\n  \n \n  \"It's so cool. It must come from deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It does,\" he said. There were tears in his eyes and a tightness in\nhis throat. \"From deep down.\"\n  \n \n  \"We can\n   \n   live\n   \n  here, Michael!\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he looked all around until his sight stopped at the bottom of a\nhill. \"We'll build our house just beyond those rocks. We'll dig and\nplant and you'll have the child.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes!\" she said. \"Oh yes!\"\n  \n \n  \"And the ones back in the city will know the Earth again. Sometime\nwe'll lead them back here and show them the Earth is coming alive.\" He\npaused. \"By following what we had to do for ourselves, we've found a\nway to save them.\"\n  \n \n  They remained kneeling in the silence beside the pool for a long time.\nThey felt the sun on their backs and looked into the clean depth of\nthe water deeply aware of the new life breathing all around them and\nof themselves absorbing it, and at the same time giving back to it the\nlife that was their own.\n  \n \n  There was only this quiet and breathing and warmth until Michael stood\nand picked up a rock and walked toward the base of the hill where he\nhad decided to build the house.\n  \n \n  ... THE END\n  \n \n<doc-sep>They ushered the man and woman into the beamed and paneled council\nchambers and sat them in thick chairs before the wall of polished wood\ndesks across which stared the line of faces, silent and waiting. And\non a far wall, facing them all, hung a silver screen, fifty feet\nsquare.\n  \n \n  The President stood. \"Members of the council.\" He paused. \"As you\nheard, they report\u2014complete failure.\" He turned to Michael. \"And now,\nthe proof.\"\n  \n \n  Michael stood beside the motion picture projector, close to his chair.\nThe lights dimmed. There was only the sound of the pumps throbbing in\nthe darkness close and far away, above and beneath and all around.\nSuddenly on the screen appeared an endless depth of blackness filled\nwith a mass of glowing white, which extended into the room around the\nwatching people, seeming to touch them and then spreading, like an\nocean, farther away and out and out into an endless distance.\n  \n \n  Now streaks of yellow fire shot into the picture, like a swarm of\nlightning bugs, the thin sharp nosed shadows of space ships, hurtling,\nlike comets, toward the clustered star smear. And then silent thoughts\nflashed from the screen into the minds of the spectators; of time\npassing in months, years and centuries, passing and passing until they\nthemselves seemed to be rushing and rushing into the blackness toward\nblinding balls of white light, the size of moons.\n  \n \n  The dark shapes of smaller spheres circling the blinding ones moved\nforward into the picture; red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many\nmixtures of all these, and then one planet filled the screen, seeming\nto be inflated, like a balloon, into a shining red ball. There was a\nrazor edge of horizon then and pink sky and an expanse of crimson.\nFlat, yellow creatures lay all around, expanding and contracting. A\nroaring rose and fell like the roaring of a million winds. Then fear\nflowed out of the picture into the minds of the watchers so that they\ngasped and cringed, and a silent voice told them that the atmosphere\nof this planet would disintegrate a human being.\n  \n \n  Now the red ball seemed to pull away from them into the blackness and\nthe blinding balls of light, and all around could be seen the streaks\nof rocket flame shooting away in all directions.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a flash cut the blackness, like the flare of a match, and\ndied, and the watchers caught from the screen the awareness of the\ndeath of a ship.\n  \n \n  They were also aware of the rushing of time through centuries and they\nsaw the streaking rocket flames and planets rushing at them; saw\ncreatures in squares and circles, in threads wriggling, in lumps and\nblobs, rolling jumping and crawling; saw them in cloud forms whisking\nabout, changing their shapes, and in flowing wavelets of water. They\nsaw creatures hopping about on one leg and others crawling at\nincredible speeds on a thousand; saw some with all the numbers of legs\nand arms in between; and were aware of creatures that were there but\ninvisible.\n  \n \n  And those watching the screen on which time and distance were a\ncompressed and distilled kaleidoscope, saw planet after planet and\nthousands at a time; heard strange noises; rasping and roaring, clinks\nand whistles, screams and crying, sighing and moaning. And they were\naware through all this of atmosphere and ground inimical to man, some\nthat would evaporate at the touch of a human body, or would burst into\nflame, or swallow, or turn from liquid to solid or solid to liquid.\nThey saw and heard chemical analyses, were aware of this ocean of\nblackness and clouds of white through which man might move, and must\never move, because he could live only upon this floating dust speck\nthat was Earth.\n  \n \n  The picture faded in, close to one of the long, needle nosed crafts,\nshowing inside, a man and a woman. Time was telescoped again while the\nman cut a tiny piece of scar tissue from his arm and that of the\nwoman, put them in bottles and set them into compartments where\nsolutions dripped rhythmically into the bottles, the temperature was\nheld at that of the human body, and synthetic sunlight focused upon\nthem from many pencil like tubes.\n  \n \n  The watchers in the council chamber saw the bits of tissue swell into\nhuman embryos in a few seconds, and grow arms and legs and faces and\nextend themselves into babies. Saw them taken from the bottles and\ncared for, and become replicas of the man and woman controlling the\nship, who, all this time were aging, until life went out of their\nbodies. Then the ones who had been the scar tissue disintegrated them\nin the coffin-like tubes and let their dust be sucked out into\nspace\u2014all this through millions of miles and a hundred years,\ncompressed for the watchers into sixty seconds and a few feet of\nspace.\n  \n \n  Instantly there was black space on the screen again, with the fingers\nof flame pointing out behind the dark bodies of the ships.\n  \n \n  And then the spectators saw one ship shudder and swerve into a\nblazing, bluish white star, like a gnat flying into a white hot poker;\nsaw another drop away and away, out and out into the blackness past\nthe swirling white rim of the galaxy, and sink into a dark\nnothingness.\n  \n \n  Great balls of rock showered like hail onto other ships, smashing them\ninto grotesque tin cans. The stream of fire at the tail of another\nship suddenly died and the ship floated into an orbit around a great,\nyellow planet, ten times the size of Jupiter, then was sucked into it.\nAnother burst like a bomb, flinging a man and woman out into the\ndarkness, where they hung suspended, frozen into statues, like bodies\ndrowned in the depths of an Arctic sea.\n  \n \n  At this instant from the watching council, there were screams of\nhorror and voices crying out, \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" There was a\nmoving about in the darkness. Murmurs and harsh cries of disapproval\ngrew in volume.\n  \n \n  Another ship in the picture was split down the side by a meteor and\nthe bodies inside were impaled on jagged blades of steel, the\ncontorted, bloody faces lighted by bursts of flame. And the screams\nand cries of the spectators rose higher, \"Shut it off.... Oh Lord....\"\n  \n \n  Lights flashed through the room and the picture died.\n  \n"

        "Suddenly, he understood. And understanding brought not peace but the\ngreatest terror he'd ever known. He screamed, \"We're on....\" but the\nswitch was thrown and there was no more speech. For an hour. Then he\ngot out of the chair and said, \"Sure glad I took my wife's advice and\ncame to see you, Doctor Hamming. I feel better already, and after only\none.... What do you call these treatments?\"\n  \n \n  \"Diathermy,\" the little doctor muttered.\n  \n \n  Harry gave him a five-dollar bill. The doctor gave him two singles in\nchange. \"That's certainly reasonable enough,\" Harry said.\n  \n \n  The doctor nodded. \"There's a police officer in the hall. He'll drive\nyou home so there won't be any trouble with the travel regulations.\"\n  \n \n  Harry said, \"Thanks. Think we'll ever see the end of travel regulations\nand rationing and all the rest of the emergency?\"\n  \n \n  \"You will, Mr. Burr.\"\n  \n \n  Harry walked to the door.\n  \n \n  \"We're on an ark,\" the doctor said.\n  \n \n  Harry turned around, smiling. \"What?\"\n  \n \n  \"A test, Mr. Burr. You passed it. Goodbye.\"\n  \n \n  Harry went home. He told Edna he felt just great! She said she'd been\nworried when an officer found Plum wandering on the road; she thought\nmaybe Harry had gone off somewhere and broken travel regulations.\n  \n \n  \"Me?\" he exclaimed, amazed. \"Break travel regulations? I'd as soon kill\na pig!\"\n  \n \n<doc-sep>They went through one of the doors on the right, into a windowless\nroom. A thin little man with bald head and frameless glasses was there,\nputting on a white coat. His veiny hands shook. He looked a hundred\nyears old. \"Where's Petey?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  \"Pete's all right, Dad. Just leading a horse back to Burr's farm.\"\n  \n \n  The old man sighed. \"I didn't know what form it would take. I expected\none or two cases, but I couldn't predict whether it would be gradual or\nsudden, whether or not it would lead to violence.\"\n  \n \n  \"No violence, Dad.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, Stan.\" He looked at Harry. \"I'm going to give you a little\ntreatment, Mr. Burr. It'll settle your nerves and make everything....\"\n  \n \n  \"What happened to Davie?\" Harry asked, things pushing at his brain\nagain.\n  \n \n  Stan helped him up. \"Just step this way, Mr. Burr.\"\n  \n \n  He didn't resist. He went through the second door into the room with\nthe big chair. He sat down and let them strap his arms and legs and let\nthem lower the metal thing over his head. He felt needles pierce his\nscalp and the back of his neck. He let them do what they wanted; he\nwould let them kill him if they wanted. All he asked was one answer so\nas to know whether or not he was insane.\n  \n \n  \"What happened to my son Davie?\"\n  \n \n  The old man walked across the room and examined what looked like the\ninsides of a dozen big radios. He turned, his hand on a switch.\n  \n \n  \"Please,\" Harry whispered. \"Just tell me about my son.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor blinked behind his glasses, and then his hand left the\nswitch. \"Dead,\" he said, his voice a rustling of dried leaves. \"Like so\nmany millions of others. Dead, when the bombs fell. Dead, as everyone\nknew they would be and no one did anything to prevent. Dead. Perhaps\nthe whole world is dead\u2014except for us.\"\n  \n \n  Harry stared at him.\n  \n<doc-sep>On a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiosity\nwould probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with\nquestions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For\nhis part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba\nuntil Joe came in, lugging a radio.\n  \n \n  \"Is that what you were talking about?\" the mayor snorted. \"What makes\nyou think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and\npolitical speech-makers.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do not jump to hasty conclusions,\" Harvey cautioned. \"Another word,\nand I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,\nwith the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventor\nof this absolutely awe-inspiring device.\"\n  \n \n  \"I ain't in the market for a radio,\" Johnson said stubbornly.\n  \n \n  Harvey nodded in relief. \"We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph.\nHe has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue our\nstudy, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an\nenormous fortune.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's no plating off our bow,\" Joe grunted. \"I'm glad he did\nturn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole\nyears.\"\n  \n \n  He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.\n  \n \n  \"Now, hold on!\" the mayor cried. \"I ain't\n   \n   saying\n   \n  I'll buy, but what\nis it I'm turning down?\"\n  \n \n  Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face\nsorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet.\n  \n \n  \"To make a long story, Mr. Johnson,\" he said, \"Joseph and I were among\nthe chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just before\nhis tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane.\" He\nbanged his fist on the bar. \"I have said it before, and I repeat again,\nthat was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredit\nhis greatest invention\u2014this fourth dimensional radio!\"\n  \n \n  \"This what?\" Johnson blurted out.\n  \n \n  \"In simple terms,\" clarified Harvey, \"the ingenious doctor discovered\nthat the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by\nenergy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the\ninhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than\nourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would\nfind himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!\"\n  \n \n  The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.\n  \n \n  \"And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?\"\n  \n \n  \"It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor\nDean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.\"\n  \n \n  The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared\nthoughtfully at the battered cabinet.\n  \n \n  \"Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,\" he\nconceded. \"But how could you understand what they're saying? Folks up\nthere wouldn't talk our language.\"\n  \n \n  Again Harvey smashed his fist down. \"Do you dare to repeat the scurvy\nlie that broke Dean's spirit and drove him to suicide?\"\n  \n \n  Johnson recoiled. \"No\u2014no,\n   \n   of course not\n   \n  . I mean, being up here, I\nnaturally couldn't get all the details.\"\n  \n \n  \"Naturally,\" Harvey agreed, mollified. \"I'm sorry I lost my temper.\nBut it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcasts\nemanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that be\nso difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was\ncommunication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired\nour language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own\nhyper-scientific trimmings?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, I don't know,\" Johnson said in confusion.\n  \n \n  \"For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect\nthe simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed\nbroadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor\nfailed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could\nstand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to\nsolve the mystery caused him to take his own life.\"\n  \n \n  Johnson winced. \"Is that what you want to unload on me?\"\n  \n \n  \"For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will be\nrewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who\ncould devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a\nperson with unusual patience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" the mayor said grudgingly, \"I ain't exactly flighty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!\"\n  \n \n  Johnson asked skeptically: \"How about a sample first?\"\n  \n"

        "They ate in the kitchen. They talked\u2014or rather Edna, Gloria and Walt\ndid. Harry nodded and said uh-huh and used his mouth for chewing.\n  \n \n  Walt and Gloria went home at ten-fifteen. They said goodbye at the\ndoor and Harry walked away. He heard Gloria whispering something about\nDoctor Hamming.\n  \n \n  He was sitting in the living room when Edna came in. She was crying.\n\"Harry, please see the doctor.\"\n  \n \n  He got up. \"I'm going out. I might even sleep out!\"\n  \n \n  \"But why, Harry, why?\"\n  \n \n  He couldn't stand to see her crying. He went to her, kissed her wet\ncheek, spoke more softly. \"It'll do me good, like when I was a kid.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say so, Harry.\"\n  \n \n  He left quickly. He went outside and across the yard to the road. He\nlooked up it and down it, to the north and to the south. It was a\nbright night with moon and stars, but he saw nothing, no one. The road\nwas empty. It was always empty, except when Walt and Gloria walked over\nfrom their place a mile or so south. But once it hadn't been empty.\nOnce there'd been cars, people....\n  \n \n  He had to do something. Just sitting and looking at the sky wouldn't\nhelp him. He had to go somewhere, see someone.\n  \n \n  He went to the barn and looked for his saddle. There was no saddle. But\nhe'd had one hanging right behind the door. Or had he?\n  \n \n  He threw a blanket over Plum, the big mare, and tied it with a piece of\nwash line. He used another piece for a bridle, since he couldn't find\nthat either, and didn't bother making a bit. He mounted, and Plum moved\nout of the barn and onto the road. He headed north, toward town.\n  \n \n  Then he realized he couldn't go along the road this way. He'd be\nreported. Breaking travel regulations was a serious offense. He didn't\nknow what they did to you, but it wasn't anything easy like a fine.\n  \n \n  He cut into an unfenced, unplanted field.\n  \n \n  His headache was back, worse now than it had ever been. His entire\nhead throbbed, and he leaned forward and put his cheek against Plum's\nmane. The mare whinnied uneasily, but he kicked her sides and she moved\nforward. He lay there, just wanting to go somewhere, just wanting to\nleave his headache and confusion behind.\n  \n \n  He didn't know how long it was, but Plum was moving cautiously now. He\nraised his head. They were approaching a fence. He noticed a gate off\nto the right, and pulled the rope so Plum went that way. They reached\nthe gate and he got down to open it, and saw the sign. \"Phineas Grotton\nFarm.\" He looked up at the sky, found the constellations, turned his\nhead, and nodded. He'd started north, and Plum had continued north.\nHe'd crossed land belonging both to himself and the Franklins. Now he\nwas leaving the Franklin farm. North of the Franklins were the Bessers.\nWho was this Phineas Grotton? Had he bought out Lon Besser? But\nanything like that would've gotten around.\n  \n \n  Was he forgetting again?\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  BREAKDOWN\n  \n \n  By HERBERT D.

Edna begged him to see the doctor living in that new house\ntwo miles past Dugan's farm, but he refused. He point-blank refused to\nadmit he was sick\n   \n   that\n   \n  way\u2014in the head!\n  \n \n  Of course, a man could grow forgetful. He had to admit there were\nmoments when he had all sorts of mixed-up memories and thoughts in his\nmind. And sometimes\u2014like right now, lying in bed beside Edna, watching\nthe first hint of light touch the windows\u2014he began sweating with fear.\nA horrible, gut-wrenching fear, all the more horrible because it was\nbased on nothing.\n  \n \n  The chicken-run came alive; the barn followed minutes later. There were\nchores to do, the same chores he'd done all his forty-one years. Except\nthat now, with the new regulations about wheat and corn, he had only\na vegetable patch to farm. Sure, he got paid for letting the fields\nremain empty. But it just didn't seem right, all that land going to\nwaste....\n  \n \n \n   Davie. Blond hair and a round, tanned face and strong arms growing\nstronger each day from helping out after school.\n   \n \n \n  He turned and shook Edna. \"What happened to Davie?\"\n  \n \n  She cleared her throat, mumbled, \"Huh? What happened to who?\"\n  \n \n  \"I said, what....\" But then it slipped away. Davie? No, that was part\nof a dream he'd had last week. He and Edna had no children.\n  \n \n  He felt the fear again, and got up fast to escape it. Edna opened her\neyes as soon as his weight left the bed. \"Like hotcakes for breakfast?\"\n  \n \n  \"Eggs,\" he said. \"Bacon.\" And then, seeing her face change, he\nremembered. \"Course,\" he muttered. \"Can't have bacon. Rationed.\"\n  \n \n  She was fully awake now. \"If you'd only go see Dr. Hamming, Harry. Just\nfor a checkup. Or let me call him so he could\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"You stop that! You stop that right now, and for good! I don't want to\nhear no more about doctors. I get laid up, I'll call one. And it won't\nbe that Hamming who I ain't never seen in my life! It'll be Timkins,\nwho took care'n us and brought our son into the world and....\"\n  \n \n  She began to cry, and he realized he'd said something crazy again. They\nhad no son, never had a son. And Timkins\u2014he'd died and they'd gone to\nhis funeral. Or so Edna said.\n  \n \n  He himself just couldn't remember it.\n  \n \n  He went to the bed and sat down beside her. \"Sorry. That was just a\ndream I had. I'm still half asleep this morning. Couldn't fall off last\nnight, not till real late. Guess I'm a little nervous, what with all\nthe new regulations and not working regular. I never meant we had a\nson.\" He waited then, hoping she'd say they\n   \n   had\n   \n  had a son, and he'd\ndied or gone away. But of course she didn't.\n  \n<doc-sep>It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd\nalso expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to\nexpect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded\nvery much the way he always had\u2014soft spoken and full of laughter and\nfull of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and\nclapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had\u2014so much\nmore gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was\ngood for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along\non the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.\n  \n \n  They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to\nManfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee\nand Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he\nmerely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.\n  \n \n  There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there\nmany times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized\nhim. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as\nif he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.\n  \n \n  At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he\nsaid, \"I haven't danced with my girl Rhona.\" His tongue was thick, his\nmind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her\nface\u2014pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual\nof flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going\nto be sick.\n  \n \n  \"So let's rock,\" he said and stood up.\n  \n \n  They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.\nAnd through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,\nmechanical dancing doll.\n  \n \n  The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,\n\"Beddy-bye time.\"\n  \n \n  Hank said, \"First one dance with my loving wife.\"\n  \n \n  He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited\nfor her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.\nBecause while she put herself against him, there was something in her\nface\u2014no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes\u2014that made him know\nshe was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when\nthe music ended, he was ready to go home.\n  \n \n  They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of\nPhil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,\nPhil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old\nself. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with\nthe First One.\n  \n \n  They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and\nPhil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and\nlooked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence\nparalleling the road. \"Hey,\" he said, pointing, \"do you know why that's\nthe most popular place on earth?\"\n  \n \n  Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a\nlittle sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a\nwhile longer, not yet aware of his supposed\n   \n   faux pas\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"You know why?\" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter\nrumbling up from his chest. \"You know why, folks?\"\n  \n \n  Rhona said, \"Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at\u2014\"\n  \n \n  Hank said, \"No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?\"\n  \n \n  Phil said, \"Because people are\u2014\" And then he caught himself and waved\nhis hand and muttered, \"I forgot the punch line.\"\n  \n \n  \"Because people are dying to get in,\" Hank said, and looked through the\nwindow, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting\ntombstones.\n  \n \n  The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been\nnothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. \"Maybe you should\nlet me out right here,\" Hank said. \"I'm home\u2014or that's what everyone\nseems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that\nwould satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or\nanother monster from the movies.\"\n  \n \n  Edith said, \"Oh, Hank, don't, don't!\"\n  \n \n  The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four\nblocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He\ndidn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path\nand entered the house.\n  \n"

        "Wilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely\nout of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped\nthrough, and closed it behind him.\n  \n \n  A flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated\ntemperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but\nfragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with\njoyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at\nlast! After six long and dreary months!\n  \n \n  Raptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes\nthat ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the\nlunar valley....\n  \n \n  How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not\nafterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He\nonly knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a\nlacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the\nchirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes\nformed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one\ncharmed.\n  \n \n  It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's\nentrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he\nwas startled to hear\u2014off to his right\u2014the sharp, explosive bark of a\nHaemholtz ray pistol.\n  \n \n  He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his\nmeandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed\nits hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the\nGateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to\njudge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the\nstructure which housed Sparks' radio turret.\n  \n \n  And the shooting? That could only be\u2014\n  \n \n  He did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that\nmoment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of\nfigures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was\nstaggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm,\nbloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in\nhis good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to\ncover his comrade's sluggish retreat.\n  \n \n  And behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with\nastonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a\ndozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Simultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A\ngasp of relief escaped the wounded man.\n  \n \n  \"Jones! Thank the Lord! Then you picked up our cry for help? Quick,\nman\u2014where is it? Theres not a moment to waste!\"\n  \n \n  \"W-where,\" faltered Isobar feebly, \"is\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  \"The tank, of course! Didn't you hear our telecast? We can't possibly\nmake it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken,\nand\u2014\" Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. \"You\ndon't have one! You're here\n   \n   alone\n   \n  ! Then you didn't pick up our call?\nBut, why\u2014?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" snapped Isobar, \"now!\" Placid by nature, he could\nmove when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their\nperil. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action\nagainst their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons\nwere useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary\nway of staving off disaster. \"Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you\ngo! Give him a lift, Brown\u2014There! That's the stuff!\"\n  \n \n  He was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy\nsanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough\nwhen a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath\nhis clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant\ninches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud.\nThe Graniteback was\n   \n   not\n   \n  a climber. It was far too ungainly, much too\nweighty for that.\n  \n \n  Roberts said weakly, \"Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.\"\n  \n \n  \"That goes for me, too, Jonesy,\" added Brown from an upper bough.\n\"But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long\nas it lasts, but\u2014\" He stared down upon the gathering knot of\nGrannies unhappily\u2014\"it's not going to last long with that bunch of\nsuperdreadnaughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they\ncome!\"\n  \n \n  For the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic\nconsultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged\nheadlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like\nthe shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted\nbeneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about\nthem in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged\nforest monarch shuddered in agony.\n  \n \n  Desperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it\ndid not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly\nto one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken\nand cracked\u2014revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!\n  \n<doc-sep>Forty miles to the south, Hap Arnold Field was a blaze of light. The\nairmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of\nthe alert siren, and behind them their wives and children stretched\nand yawned and worried. An alert! The older kids fussed and complained\nand their mothers shut them up. No, there wasn't any alert scheduled\nfor tonight; no, they didn't know where Daddy was going; no, the kids\ncouldn't get up yet\u2014it was the middle of the night.\n  \n \n  And as soon as they had the kids back in bed, most of the mothers\nstruggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing\narea to hear.\n  \n \n  They caught the words from a distance\u2014not quite correctly. \"Riot!\"\ngasped an aircraftswoman first-class, mother of three. \"The wipes! I\n   \n   told\n   \n  Charlie they'd get out of hand and\u2014Alys, we aren't safe. You\nknow how they are about GI women! I'm going right home and get a club\nand stand right by the door and\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Club!\" snapped Alys, radarscope-sergeant, with two children\nquerulously awake in her nursery at home. \"What in God's name is the\nuse of a club? You can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head. You'd\nbetter come along to Supply with me and draw a gun\u2014you'll need it\nbefore this night is over.\"\n  \n \n  But the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the\nscramble-call speakers, and they knew it was not merely a matter of\ntrouble in the wipe quarters. The Jug! The governor himself had called\nthem out; they were to fly interdicting missions at such-and-such\nlevels on such-and-such flight circuits around the prison.\n  \n \n  The rockets took off on fountains of fire; and the jets took off with a\nwhistling roar; and last of all, the helicopters took off ... and they\nwere the ones who might actually accomplish something. They took up\ntheir picket posts on the prison perimeter, a pilot and two bombardiers\nin each 'copter, stone-faced, staring grimly alert at the prison below.\n  \n \n  They were ready for the breakout.\n  \n \n  But there wasn't any breakout.\n  \n \n  The rockets went home for fuel. The jets went home for fuel. The\nhelicopters hung on\u2014still ready, still waiting.\n  \n \n  The rockets came back and roared harmlessly about, and went away again.\nThey stayed away. The helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed.\nThe prison below them was washed with light\u2014from the guard posts on\nthe walls, from the cell blocks themselves, from the mobile lights of\nthe guard squadrons surrounding the walls.\n  \n \n  North of the prison, on the long, flat, damp developments of reclaimed\nland, the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed\nlights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion\nfrom their undesired neighbors to the east, the wipes. In the crowded\ntenements of the laborers' quarters, the wipes shouted from window to\nwindow; and there were crowds in the bright streets.\n  \n \n  \"The whole bloody thing's going to blow up!\" a helicopter bombardier\nyelled bitterly to his pilot, above the flutter and roar of the\nwhirling blades. \"Look at the mobs in Greaserville! The first breakout\nfrom the Jug's going to start a fight like you never saw and we'll be\nright in the middle of it!\"\n  \n \n  He was partly right. He would be right in the middle of it\u2014for every\nman, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of\nit. There was no place anywhere that would be spared.\n   \n   No mixing.\n   \n  That\nwas the prescription that kept the city-state alive. There's no harm in\na family fight\u2014and aren't all mechanics a family, aren't all laborers\na clan, aren't all clerks and office workers related by closer ties\nthan blood or skin?\n  \n \n  But the declassed cons of the Jug were the dregs of every class; and\nonce they spread, the neat compartmentation of society was pierced. The\nbreakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever\nknown.\n  \n \n  But he was also partly wrong. Because the breakout wasn't seeming to\ncome.\n  \n<doc-sep>I leaped into the driver's seat and gave the kite its head. And now the\ncountry began to undergo a subtle change. The trees seemed to group\nthemselves in a long flanking corridor in a northwesterly direction, as\nif to hide some secret that lay beyond. Twice I attempted to penetrate\nthat wall, only to find my way blocked by those curious growths.\n  \n \n  Then a corridor opened before me; a mile forward and the desert began\nagain. But it was a new desert this time: the sand packed hard as\ngranite, the way ahead utterly devoid of vegetation. In the distance\nblack bulging hills extended to right and left, with a narrow chasm or\ndoorway between.\n  \n \n  I headed for that entrance, and when I reached it, I shut off power\nwith an exclamation of astonishment.\n  \n \n  There was a huge chair-shaped rock there, and seated upon it was\nGrannie Annie. She had a tablet in her hands, and she was writing.\n  \n \n  \"Grannie!\" I yelled. \"What're you doing here? Where's Mr. Baker?\"\n  \n \n  She rose to her feet and clambered down the rock.\n  \n \n  \"Getting back Jimmy's mine laborers,\" she said, a twinkle in her eyes.\n\"I see you've got Antlers Park. I'm glad of that. It saves me a lot of\ntrouble.\" She took off her spectacles and wiped them on her sleeve.\n\"Don't look so fuddled, Billy-boy. Come along, and I'll show you.\"\n  \n \n  She led the way through the narrow passage into the valley. A deep\ngorge, it was, with the black sheer cliffs on either side pressing\nclose. Ten feet forward, I stopped short, staring in amazement.\n  \n \n  Advancing toward me like a column of infantry came a long line of\nLarynx miners. They walked slowly, looking straight ahead, moving down\nthe center of the gorge toward the entrance.\n  \n \n  But there was more! A kite car was drawn up to the side. The windscreen\nhad been removed, and mounted on the hood was a large bullet-like\ncontrivance that looked not unlike a search lamp. A blinding shaft of\nbluish radiance spewed from its open end. Playing it back and forth\nupon the marching men were Jimmy Baker and Xartal, the Martian.\n  \n \n  \"Ultra violet,\" Grannie Annie explained. \"The opposite end of the\nvibratory scale and the only thing that will combat the infra-red rays\nthat cause red spot fever. Those men won't stop walking until they've\nreached Shaft Four.\"\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie told her story during the long ride back to Shaft Four.\nWe drove slowly, keeping the line of marching Larynx miners always\nahead of us.\n  \n \n  Jimmy Baker had struck a new big lode of Acoustix, a lode which if\nworked successfully would see\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  become a far more\npowerful exporting concern than\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . Antlers Park\ndidn't want that.\n  \n \n  It was he or his agents who placed those lens buttons in the Larynx\nbarracks.\n   \n   For he knew that just as Jupiter's great spot was\nresponsible for a climate and atmosphere suitable for an Earthman on\nthis Eighth Moon, so also was that spot a deadly power in itself,\ncapable when its rays were concentrated of causing a fatal sickness.\n   \n \n \n  Then suddenly becoming fearful of Grannie's prying, Antlers Park strove\nto head her off before she reached Shaft Four.\n  \n \n  He did head her off and managed to lure her and Baker and Xartal into\nthe Shaft barracks where they would be exposed to the rays from the\nlens button. But Grannie only pretended to contract the plague.\n  \n \n  Park then attempted to outwit Ezra Karn and me by returning in Jimmy\nBaker's kite car with a cockatoo image of Grannie.\n  \n"

        "His entire body trembled. His mind trembled too. He walked, and came to\na waist-high metal railing, and made a tiny sound deep in his throat.\nHe looked out over water, endless water rolling in endless waves under\nthe night sky. Crashing water, topped with reflected silver from the\nmoon. Pounding water, filling the air with spray.\n  \n \n  He put out his hands and grasped the railing. It was wet. He raised\ndamp fingers to his mouth. Salt.\n  \n \n  He stepped back, back, and turned and ran. He ran wildly, blindly,\nuntil he could run no more. Then he fell, feeling the sand beneath him,\nand shut his eyes and mind to everything.\n  \n \n  Much later, he got up and went to the fence and climbed it. He came\ndown on the other side and looked around and saw Plum. He walked to\nher, mounted her, sat still. The thoughts, or dreams, or whatever they\nwere which had been torturing him these past few weeks began torturing\nhim again.\n  \n \n  It was getting light. His head was splitting.\n  \n \n  Davie. His son Davie. Fourteen years old. Going to high school in\ntown....\n  \n \n \n   Town!\n   \n  He should've gone there in the first place! He would ride east,\nto the road, then head south, back toward home. That would bring him\nright down Main Street. Regulations or not, he'd talk to people, find\nout what was happening.\n  \n \n  He kicked Plum's sides. The mare began to move. He kept kicking until\nshe broke into a brisk canter. He held on with hands and legs.\n  \n \n  Why hadn't he seen the Pangborns and Elvertons lately\u2014a long time\nlately?\n  \n \n \n   The ocean. He'd seen the ocean. Not a reservoir or lake made by\nflooding and by damming, but salt water and enormous. An ocean, where\nthere could be no ocean. The Pangborns and Elvertons had been where\nthat ocean was now. And after the Elvertons had come the Dobsons.\nAnd after them the new plastics plant. And after that the city of\nCrossville. And after that....\n   \n \n \n  He was passing his own farm. He hadn't come through town, and yet here\nhe was at his own farm. Could he have forgotten where town was? Could\nit be north of his home, not south? Could a man get so confused as to\nforget things he'd known all his life?\n  \n \n  He reached the Shanks' place, and passed it at a trot. Then he was\nbeyond their boundaries and breaking regulations again. He stayed on\nthe road. He went by a small house and saw colored folks in the yard.\nThere'd been no colored folks here. There'd been Eli Bergen and his\nfamily and his mother, in a bigger, newer house. The colored folks\nheard Plum's hooves and looked up and stared. Then a man raised his\nvoice. \"Mistah, you breakin' regulations! Mistah, the police gonnah get\nyou!\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Once seated, the AEC man said \"I'll get right to the point. You may\nfind this troublesome, gentlemen, but your government intends to\nconfiscate all of the devices using your so-called Expendable field,\nand forever bar their manufacture in this country or their importation.\"\n  \n \n  \"You stinking G-men aren't getting away with this,\" Carmen said\ningratiatingly. \"Ever hear of the Mafia?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not much,\" the young man admitted earnestly, \"since the FBI finished\nwith its deportations a few years back.\"\n  \n \n  I cleared my throat. \"I must admit that the destruction of a\nmulti-billion business is disconcerting before lunch. May we ask why\nyou took this step?\"\n  \n \n  The agent inserted a finger between his collar and tie. \"Have you\nnoticed how unseasonably warm it is?\"\n  \n \n  \"I wondered if you had. You're going to have heat prostration if you\nkeep that suit coat on five minutes more.\"\n  \n \n  The young man collapsed back in his chair, loosening the top button of\nhis ivy league jacket, looking from my naked hide to the gossomer scrap\nof sport shirt Carmen wore. \"We have to dress inconspicuously in the\nservice,\" he panted weakly.\n  \n \n  I nodded understandingly. \"What does the heat have to do with the\noutlawing of the Expendables?\"\n  \n \n  \"At first we thought there might be some truth in the folk nonsense\nthat nuclear tests had something to do with raising the mean\ntemperature of the world,\" the AEC man said. \"But our scientists\nquickly found they weren't to blame.\"\n  \n \n  \"Clever of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, they saw that the widespread use of your machines was responsible\nfor the higher temperature. Your device violates the law of\nconservation of energy,\n   \n   seemingly\n   \n  . It\n   \n   seemingly\n   \n  destroys matter\nwithout creating energy. Actually\u2014\"\n  \n \n  He paused dramatically.\n  \n \n  \"Actually, your device added the energy it created in destroying matter\nto the energy potential of the planet in the form of\n   \n   heat\n   \n  . You see\nwhat that means? If your devices continue in operation, the mean\ntemperature of Earth will rise to the point where we burst into flame.\nThey must be outlawed!\"\n  \n \n  \"I agree,\" I said reluctantly.\n  \n \n  Tony Carmen spoke up. \"No, you don't, Professor. We don't agree to\nthat.\"\n  \n \n  I waved his protests aside.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   would\n   \n  agree,\" I said, \"except that it wouldn't work. Explain the\ndanger to the public, let them feel the heat rise themselves, and they\nwill hoard Expendables against seizure and continue to use them, until\nwe do burst into flame, as you put it so religiously.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\" the young man demanded.\n  \n \n  \"Because Expendables are convenient. There is a ban on frivolous use\nof water due to the dire need. But the police still have to go stop\npeople from watering lawns, and I suspect not a few swimming pools are\nbeing filled on the sly. Water is somebody else's worry. So will be\ngenerating enough heat to turn Eden into Hell.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mass psychology isn't my strongest point,\" the young man said\nworriedly. \"But I suspect you may be right. Then\u2014we'll be damned?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, not necessarily,\" I told him comfortingly. \"All we have to do is\n   \n   use up\n   \n  the excess energy with engines of a specific design.\"\n  \n \n  \"But can we design those engines in time?\" the young man wondered with\nuncharacteristic gloom.\n  \n \n  \"Certainly,\" I said, practising the power of positive thinking. \"Now\nthat your world-wide testing laboratories have confirmed a vague fear\nof mine, I can easily reverse the field of the Expendable device and\ncreate a rather low-efficiency engine that consumes the excess energy\nin our planetary potential.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>The chief called me in one day. He looked haggard.\n  \n \n  \"Er\u2014old man,\" he said, not quite able to bring himself to utter my\nname, \"I'm going to have to switch you to another department. How would\nyou like to work on nutrition kits? Very interesting work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nutrition kits?\n   \n   Me?\n   \n  On nutrition kits?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I\u2014er\u2014know it sounds unusual, but it justifies. I just had\nthe cybs work it over in the light of present regulations, and it\njustifies.\"\n  \n \n  Everything had to justify, of course. Every act in the monthly report\nhad to be covered by regulations and cross-regulations. Of course there\nwere so many regulations that if you just took the time to work it out,\nyou could justify damn near anything. I knew what the chief was up to.\nJust to remove me from my post would have taken a year of applications\nand hearings and innumerable visits to the capital in Center One. But\nif I should infract\u2014deliberately infract\u2014it would enable the chief to\nlet me go. The equivalent of resigning.\n  \n \n  \"I'll infract,\" I said. \"Rather than go on nutrition kits, I'll\ninfract.\"\n  \n \n  He looked vastly relieved. \"Uh\u2014fine,\" he said. \"I rather hoped you\nwould.\"\n  \n \n  It took a week or so. Then I was on Non-Productive status and issued an\nN/P book for my necessities. Very few luxury coupons in the N/P book.\nI didn't really mind at first. My new living machine was smaller, but\nbasically comfortable, and since I was still a loyal member of the\nstate and a verified conformist, I wouldn't starve.\n  \n \n  But I didn't know what I was in for.\n  \n \n  I went from bureau to bureau, office to office, department to\ndepartment\u2014any place where they might use a space drive expert. A\npattern began to emerge; the same story everywhere. When I mentioned my\nspecialty they would look delighted. When I handed them my tag and they\nsaw my name, they would go into immediate polite confusion. As soon as\nthey recovered they would say they'd call me if anything turned up....\n  \n"

        " \n  The Girls From Fieu Dayol\n  \n \n  By ROBERT F. YOUNG\n  \n \n  They were lovely and quick\n   \n  to learn\u2014and their only\n   \n  faults were little ones!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old\nbooks had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue.\nNot that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the\nbackground for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.\n  \n \n  On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy\npaper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj\nCai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n  \n<doc-sep>Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend\nturned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of\nher own. From the vantage point of a strategically located reading\ntable, where he was keeping company with his favorite little magazine,\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  , Quidley watched her take a seemingly haphazard route\nto the shelf where Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  reposed, take the volume down,\nsurreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages\nand return it to the shelf.\n  \n \n  After she left he wasted no time in acquainting himself with the second\nmessage. It was as unintelligible as the first:\n  \n \n \n   asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Habe\nwotnid ig ist ending ifedererer te.

He knew, at least, who Cai\nwas, and he knew\u2014from the reappearance of the words\n   \n   wotnid\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Fieu\nDayol\n   \n  and\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  \u2014that the two communications were in the\nsame code. And certainly it was reasonable to assume that the last\nword\u2014\n   \n   Yoolna\n   \n  \u2014was the name of the girl he had just seen, and that\nshe was a different person from the\n   \n   Klio\n   \n  whose name had appended the\nfirst message.\n  \n \n  He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the book\nto the shelf and went back to the reading table and\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Kay didn't show up till almost closing time, and he was beginning\nto think that perhaps she wouldn't come around for the pickup till\ntomorrow when she finally walked in the door. She employed the same\ntactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by\nchance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same\nundetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out\nthe door, he was not far behind her.\n  \n \n  She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street. It\ntook him but a moment to gain his hardtop and start out after her.\nWhen, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an\nall-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a\nmatter of following her inside.\n  \n \n  He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead\nbefore, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple.\nFirst you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you\nsituated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the\nnearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and\nafter the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till\nhe/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar.\nWhen she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a\nway that some of its contents spilled on her lap\u2014\n  \n \n  \"I'm terribly sorry,\" he said, righting it. \"Here, let me brush it off.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>A station wagon came up behind them, slowed, and matched its speed\nwith theirs. \"Someone's following us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"Probably Jilka.\"\n  \n \n  Five minutes later the station wagon turned down a side street and\ndisappeared. \"She's no longer with us,\" Quidley said.\n  \n \n  \"She's got to pick someone up. She'll meet us later.\"\n  \n \n  \"At your folks'?\"\n  \n \n  \"At the ship.\"\n  \n \n  The city was thinning out around them now, and a few stars were visible\nin the night sky. Quidley watched them thoughtfully for a while. Then:\n\"What ship?\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"The one we're going to\n   \n   Fieu Dayol\n   \n  on.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Fieu Dayol?\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Persei 17 to you.

He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section.

He plotted\nmentally, of course\u2014notes were for the hacks and the other commercial\nnon-geniuses who infested the modern literary world. Closing his eyes,\nhe saw the whole vivid panorama of epic action and grand adventure\nflowing like a mighty and majestic river before his literary vision:\nthe authentic and awe-inspiring background; the hordes of colorful\ncharacters; the handsome virile hero, the compelling Helenesque\nheroine.... God, it was going to be great! The best thing he'd ever\ndone! See, already there was a crowd of book lovers in front of the\nbookstore, staring into the window where the new Herbert Quidley was\non display, trying to force its way into the jammed interior....\n   \n   Cut\nto interior.\n   \n  FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell me quickly, are there any\nmore copies of the new Herbert Quidley left? BOOK CLERK: A few. You\ndon't know how lucky you are to get here before the first printing ran\nout. FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Give me a dozen. I want to make sure that\nmy children and my children's children have a plentiful supply. BOOK\nCLERK: Sorry. Only one to a customer. Next? SECOND EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell\nme quickly, are ... there ... any ... more ... copies ... of\u2014\n  \n \n  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ....\n  \n \n  Message no. 4, except for a slight variation in camouflage, ran true to\nform:\n  \n \n \n   a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj Cai: Habe te snoll dopers ensing?\nWotnid ne Fieu Dayol ist ifederereret, hid jestig snoll doper.

What, he asked himself, standing in the library aisle\nand staring at the indecipherable words, was a normal girl like Kay\ndoing in such a childish secret society? From the way she and her\ncorrespondents carried on you'd almost think they were Martian girl\nscouts on an interplanetary camping trip, trying for their merit badges\nin communications!\n  \n \n  You could hardly call Kay a girl scout, though.\n  \n \n  Nevertheless, she was the key figure in the\n   \n   snoll-doper\n   \n  enigma. The\nfact annoyed him, especially when he considered that a\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  ,\nfor all he knew, could be anything from a Chinese fortune cooky to an\nH-bomb.\n  \n \n  He remembered Kay's odd accent. Was that the way a person would speak\nEnglish if her own language ran something like \"\n   \n   ist ifedereret, hid\njestig snoll doper adwo\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He remembered the way she had looked at him in the coffee bar.\n  \n \n  He remembered the material of her dress.\n  \n \n  He remembered how she had come to his room.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't know you had a taste for Taine.\"\n  \n<doc-sep>Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend\nturned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of\nher own.

        "The following evening found Quidley on tenter-hooks. The\n   \n   snoll-doper\n   \n  mystery had acquired a new tang. He could hardly wait till the next\nmessage transfer took place.\n  \n \n  He decided to spend the evening plotting the epic novel which he\nintended to write someday. He set to work immediately. He plotted\nmentally, of course\u2014notes were for the hacks and the other commercial\nnon-geniuses who infested the modern literary world. Closing his eyes,\nhe saw the whole vivid panorama of epic action and grand adventure\nflowing like a mighty and majestic river before his literary vision:\nthe authentic and awe-inspiring background; the hordes of colorful\ncharacters; the handsome virile hero, the compelling Helenesque\nheroine.... God, it was going to be great! The best thing he'd ever\ndone! See, already there was a crowd of book lovers in front of the\nbookstore, staring into the window where the new Herbert Quidley was\non display, trying to force its way into the jammed interior....\n   \n   Cut\nto interior.\n   \n  FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell me quickly, are there any\nmore copies of the new Herbert Quidley left? BOOK CLERK: A few. You\ndon't know how lucky you are to get here before the first printing ran\nout. FIRST EAGER CUSTOMER: Give me a dozen. I want to make sure that\nmy children and my children's children have a plentiful supply. BOOK\nCLERK: Sorry. Only one to a customer. Next? SECOND EAGER CUSTOMER: Tell\nme quickly, are ... there ... any ... more ... copies ... of\u2014\n  \n \n  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ....\n  \n \n  Message no. 4, except for a slight variation in camouflage, ran true to\nform:\n  \n \n \n   a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj a;sldkfj Cai: Habe te snoll dopers ensing?\nWotnid ne Fieu Dayol ist ifederereret, hid jestig snoll doper.

What, he asked himself, standing in the library aisle\nand staring at the indecipherable words, was a normal girl like Kay\ndoing in such a childish secret society? From the way she and her\ncorrespondents carried on you'd almost think they were Martian girl\nscouts on an interplanetary camping trip, trying for their merit badges\nin communications!\n  \n \n  You could hardly call Kay a girl scout, though.\n  \n \n  Nevertheless, she was the key figure in the\n   \n   snoll-doper\n   \n  enigma. The\nfact annoyed him, especially when he considered that a\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  ,\nfor all he knew, could be anything from a Chinese fortune cooky to an\nH-bomb.\n  \n \n  He remembered Kay's odd accent. Was that the way a person would speak\nEnglish if her own language ran something like \"\n   \n   ist ifedereret, hid\njestig snoll doper adwo\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He remembered the way she had looked at him in the coffee bar.\n  \n \n  He remembered the material of her dress.\n  \n \n  He remembered how she had come to his room.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't know you had a taste for Taine.\"\n  \n<doc-sep> \n  The Girls From Fieu Dayol\n  \n \n  By ROBERT F.

He liked old wood, too, and old\npaintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he\nliked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way\nHelen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and\nstarted building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and\nliquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would\nhave made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris\nwasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.\n  \n \n  After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's\ndesk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered\nhis eyes to the\n   \n   Anabasis\n   \n  and henceforth followed her progress out of\ntheir corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book\nand glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the\nP's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused\nagain and took down Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an\ninterest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library\nwere ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the\nvolume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it\nwith the air of a seasoned browser.\n  \n \n  Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected\nanother\u2014seemingly at random\u2014and took it over to the librarian's desk.\nShe waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked\nit under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night.\nAs soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took\nTaine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark\nwas gone.\n  \n \n  He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines\nof gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was\nit merely what it appeared to be on the surface\u2014the efforts of an\nimpatient typing student to type before his time?\n  \n \n  He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that\nthe girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The\nname rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had\ncontained the word \"Cai\", and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got\n\"Kai\"\u2014or \"Kay\". Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and\nhad been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream\nof borrowing.\n  \n \n  By whom\u2014her boy friend?\n  \n \n  Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the\npresence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but\nbecause the term itself brought to mind the word \"fiance,\" and the word\n\"fiance\" brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him\nviolently. I.e., \"marriage\". Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's\n   \n   History\n   \n  under observation for a while.\n  \n<doc-sep>In telling him that she would be in town two nights hence, Kay had\nunwittingly apprised him that there would be no exchange of messages\nuntil that time, so the next evening he skipped his vigil at the\nlibrary. The following evening, however, after readying his apartment\nfor the forthcoming assignation, he hied himself to his reading-table\npost and took up\n   \n   The Zeitgeist\n   \n  once again.\n  \n \n  He had not thought it possible that there could be a third such woman.\n  \n \n  And yet there she was, walking in the door, tall and blue-eyed and\ngraceful; dark of hair and noble of mien; browsing in the philosophy\nsection now, now the fiction section, now moving leisurely into the\nliterature aisle and toward the T's....\n  \n \n  The camouflage had varied, but the message was typical enough:\n  \n \n \n   fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; Cai: Gind\nen snoll doper nckli! Wotnid antwaterer Fieu Dayol hid jestig snoll\ndoper ifedererer te. Dep gogensplo snoll dopers ensing!\u2014Gorka. fdsa\njkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl; fdsa jkl;\n   \n \n \n  Judging from the repeated use of the words,\n   \n   snoll dopers\n   \n  were the\ntopic of the day. Annoyed, Quidley replaced the message and put the\nbook back on the shelf. Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay.\n  \n \n  He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what\na\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur\nsecret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged.\nIt virtually had to be an amateur secret society. Unless, of course,\nthey were foreigners. But what on earth foreign organization would be\nquixotic enough to employ Taine's\n   \n   History of English Literature\n   \n  as a\ncommunications medium when there was a telephone in every drugstore and\na mailbox on every corner?\n  \n \n  Somehow the words \"what on earth foreign organization\" got turned\naround in his mind and became \"what foreign organization on earth\" and\nbefore he could summon his common sense to succor him, he experienced\na rather bad moment. By the time the door chimes sounded he was his\nnormal self again.\n  \n \n  He straightened his tie with nervous fingers, checked to see if his\nshirt cuffs protruded the proper length from his coat sleeves, and\nlooked around the room to see if everything was in place. Everything\nwas\u2014the typewriter uncovered and centered on the chrome-trimmed desk,\nwith the sheaf of crinkly first-sheets beside it; the reference books\nstacked imposingly nearby;\n   \n   Harper's\n   \n  ,\n   \n   The Atlantic\n   \n  and\n   \n   The Saturday\nReview\n   \n  showing conspicuously in the magazine rack; the newly opened\nbottle of bourbon and the two snifter glasses on the sideboard; the\nsmall table set cozily for two\u2014\n  \n"

Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n<doc-sep> \n  It all began on a Saturday\nnight at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  . If\nyou've seen any recent Martian\ntravel folders, you know the place:\n\"A picturesque oasis of old Martian\ncharm, situated on the beauteous\nGrand Canal in the heart of\nMarsport. Only half a mile from\nhistoric Chandler Field, landing\nsite of the first Martian expedition\nnearly fifty years ago in 1990. A\nvisitor to the hotel, lunch room or\ncocktail lounge will thrill at the\nsight of hardy space pioneers mingling\nside by side with colorful\nMartian tribesmen. An evening at\n   \n   The Space Room\n   \n  is an amazing,\nunforgettable experience.\"\n  \n \n  Of course, the folders neglect to\nadd that the most amazing aspect is\nthe scent of the Canal's stagnant\nwater\u2014and that the most unforgettable\nexperience is seeing the \"root-of-all-evil\"\nevaporate from your\npocketbook like snow from the\nGreat Red Desert.\n  \n \n  We were sitting on the bandstand\nof the candle-lit cocktail lounge.\nMe\u2014Jimmie Stanley\u2014and my\nfour-piece combo. Maybe you've\nseen our motto back on Earth:\n\"The Hottest Music This Side of\nMercury.\"\n  \n \n  But there weren't four of us tonight.\nOnly three. Ziggy, our bass\nfiddle man, had nearly sliced off\ntwo fingers while opening a can of\nSaturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing\nthe number of our personnel by a\ntragic twenty-five per cent.\n  \n \n  Which was why Ke-teeli, our\nboss, was descending upon us with\nall the grace of an enraged Venusian\nvinosaur.\n  \n \n  \"Where ees museek?\" he shrilled\nin his nasal tenor. He was almost\nskeleton thin, like most Martians,\nand so tall that if he fell down he'd\nbe half way home.\n  \n \n  I gulped. \"Our bass man can't\nbe here, but we've called the Marsport\nlocal for another. He'll be here\nany minute.\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to\nas Goon-Face and The Eye, leered\ncoldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.\nHis eyes were like black\nneedle points set deep in a mask of\ndry, ancient, reddish leather.\n  \n \n  \"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,\"\nhe squeaked.\n  \n \n  I sighed. This was the week our\ncontract ended. Goon-Face had displayed\nlittle enough enthusiasm for\nour music as it was. His comments\nwere either, \"Ees too loud, too fast,\"\nor \"Ees too slow, too soft.\" The real\ncause of his concern being, I suspected,\nthe infrequency with which\nhis cash register tinkled.\n  \n \n  \"But,\" I added, \"even if the new\nman doesn't come,\n   \n   we're\n   \n  still here.\nWe'll play for you.\" I glanced at\nthe conglomeration of uniformed\nspacemen, white-suited tourists,\nand loin-clothed natives who sat at\nancient stone tables. \"You wouldn't\nwant to disappoint your customers,\nwould you?\"\n  \n \n  Ke-teeli snorted. \"Maybe ees better\ndey be deesappointed. Ees better\nno museek den bad museek.\"\n  \n \n  Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles\non Martian horn-harp, made a\nfeeble attempt at optimism. \"Don't\nworry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass\nman will be here.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Hammer-Head, our\nred-haired vibro-drummer. \"I think\nI hear him coming now.\"\n  \n \n  Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the\nentrance. There was only silence.\nHis naked, parchment-like chest\nswelled as if it were an expanding\nballoon.\n  \n \n  \"Five meenutes!\" he shrieked.\n\"Eef no feedle, den you go!\" And\nhe whirled away.\n  \n \n  We waited.\n  \n \n  Fat Boy's two hundred and\neighty-odd pounds were drooped\nover his chair like the blubber of an\nexhausted, beach-stranded whale.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" he muttered, \"there's always\nthe uranium pits of Neptune.\nCourse, you don't live more than\nfive years there\u2014\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe we could make it back\nto Lunar City,\" suggested Hammer-Head.\n  \n \n  \"Using what for fare?\" I asked.\n\"Your brains?\"\n  \n \n  Hammer-Head groaned. \"No. I\nguess it'll have to be the black pits\nof Neptune. The home of washed-up\ninterplanetary musicians. It's too\nbad. We're so young, too.\"\n  \n \n  The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli\nwas casting his razor-edged glare in\nour direction. I brushed the chewed\nfinger nails from the keyboard of\nmy electronic piano.\n  \n \n  Then it happened.\n  \n"

We hung onto what we found because the\nrisks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there.\nBut there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to\nall of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger\u2014and horror.\n  \n<doc-sep>A slight sound behind me made me spin around in my chair. Framed in the\ndoorway was the heavy figure of my Third Officer, Spinelli. His black\neyes were fastened hungrily on the lump of yellow metal on the table.\nHe needed no explanation to tell him what it was, and it seemed to me\nthat his very soul reached out for the stuff, so sharp and clear was\nthe meaning of the expression on his heavy face.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Spinelli!\" I snapped, \"In the future knock before entering my\nquarters!\"\n  \n \n  Reluctantly his eyes left the lump of gold and met mine. \"From the\nderelict, Captain?\" There was an imperceptible pause between the last\ntwo words.\n  \n \n  I ignored his question and made a mental note to keep a close hand on\nthe rein with him. Spinelli was big and dangerous.\n  \n \n  \"Speak your piece, Mister,\" I ordered sharply.\n  \n \n  \"Mister Cohn reports the derelict ready to take aboard the prize\ncrew ... sir,\" he said slowly. \"I'd like to volunteer for that detail.\"\n  \n \n  I might have let him go under ordinary circumstances, for he was a\nfirst class spaceman and the handling of a jury-rigged hulk would\nneed good men. But the gold-hunger I had seen in his eyes warned me\nto beware. I shook my head. \"You will stay on board the Maid with me,\nSpinelli. Cohn and Zaleski will handle the starship.\"\n  \n \n  Stark suspicion leaped into his eyes. I could see the wheels turning\nslowly in his mind. Somehow, he was thinking, I was planning to cheat\nhim of his rightful share of the derelict treasure ship.\n  \n \n  \"We will say nothing to the rest of the crew about the gold, Mister\nSpinelli,\" I said deliberately, \"Or you'll go to Callisto in irons. Is\nthat clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Aye, sir,\" murmured Spinelli. The black expression had left his face\nand there was a faintly scornful smile playing about his mouth as he\nturned away. I began wondering then what he had in mind. It wasn't like\nhim to let it go at that.\n  \n \n  Suddenly I became conscious of being very tired. My mind wasn't\nfunctioning quite clearly. And my arm and hand ached painfully. I\nrubbed the fingers to get some life back into them, still wondering\nabout Spinelli.\n  \n \n  Spinelli talked. I saw him murmuring something to big Zaleski, and\nafter that there was tension in the air. Distrust.\n  \n \n  For a few moments I pondered the advisability of making good my threat\nto clap Spinelli into irons, but I decided against it. In the first\nplace I couldn't prove he had told Zaleski about the gold and in the\nsecond place I needed Spinelli to help run the Maid.\n  \n \n  I felt that the Third Officer and Zaleski were planning something, and\nI was just as sure that Spinelli was watching Zaleski to see to it that\nthere was no double-cross.\n  \n \n  I figured that I could handle the Third Officer alone so I assigned the\nrest, Marvin and Chelly, to accompany Cohn and Zaleski onto the hulk.\nThat way Zaleski would be outnumbered if he tried to skip with the\ntreasure ship. But, of course, I couldn't risk telling them that they\nwere to be handling a vessel practically made of gold.\n  \n \n  I was in agony. I didn't want to let anyone get out of my sight with\nthat starship, and at the same time I couldn't leave the Maid. Finally\nI had to let Cohn take command of the prize crew, but not before I had\nset the radar finder on the Maid's prow squarely on the derelict.\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures.

How\n   \n  could he know his dreams should have been nightmares?\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Fall 1949.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Gold! A magic word, even today, isn't it? Lust and gold ... they go\nhand in hand. Like the horsemen of the Apocalypse. And, of course,\nthere's another word needed to make up the trilogy. You don't get\nany thing for nothing. So add this: Cost. Or you might call it pain,\nsorrow, agony. Call it what you like. It's what you pay for great\ntreasure....\n  \n \n  These things were true when fabled Jason sailed the Argo beyond Colchis\nseeking the Fleece. They were true when men sailed the southern oceans\nin wooden ships. And the conquest of space hasn't changed us a bit.\nWe're still a greedy lot....\n  \n \n  I'm a queer one to be saying these things, but then, who has more\nright? Look at me. My hair is gray and my face ... my face is a mask.\nThe flesh hangs on my bones like a yellow cloth on a rickety frame. I\nam old, old. And I wait here on my hospital cot\u2014wait for the weight of\nyears I never lived to drag me under and let me forget the awful things\nmy eyes have seen.\n  \n \n  I'm poor, too, or else I wouldn't be here in this place of dying for\nold spacemen. I haven't a dime except for the pittance the Holcomb\nFoundation calls a spaceman's pension. Yet I had millions in my hands.\nTreasure beyond your wildest dreams! Cursed treasure....\n  \n \n  You smile. You are thinking that I'm just an old man, beached\nearthside, spinning tall tales to impress the youngsters. Maybe,\nthinking about the kind of spacemen my generation produced, you have\nthe idea that if ever we'd so much as laid a hand on anything of value\nout in space we'd not let go until Hell froze over! Well, you're\nright about that. We didn't seek the spaceways for the advancement of\ncivilization or any of that Foundation bushwah, you can be certain of\nthat. We did it for\n   \n   us\n   \n  ... for Number One. That's the kind of men we\nwere, and we were proud of it. We hung onto what we found because the\nrisks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there.\nBut there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to\nall of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger\u2014and horror.\n  \n<doc-sep>The first thing about the derelict that struck us as we drew near was\nher size. No ship ever built in the Foundation Yards had ever attained\nsuch gargantuan proportions. She must have stretched a full thousand\nfeet from bow to stern, a sleek torpedo shape of somehow unspeakable\nalienness. Against the backdrop of the Milky Way, she gleamed fitfully\nin the light of the faraway sun, the metal of her flanks grained with\nsomething like tiny, glittering whorls. It was as though the stuff\nwere somehow unstable ... seeking balance ... maybe even alive in some\nstrange and alien way.\n  \n \n  It was readily apparent to all of us that she had never been built for\ninter-planetary flight. She was a starship. Origin unknown. An aura of\nmystery surrounded her like a shroud, protecting the world that gave\nher birth mutely but effectively. The distance she must have come was\nunthinkable. And the time it had taken...? Aeons. Millennia. For she\nwas drifting, dead in space, slowly spinning end over end as she swung\nabout Sol in a hyperbolic orbit that would soon take her out and away\nagain into the inter-stellar deeps.\n  \n \n  Something had wounded her ... perhaps ten million years ago ... perhaps\nyesterday. She was gashed deeply from stem to stern with a jagged rip\nthat bared her mangled innards. A wandering asteroid? A meteor? We\nwould never know. It gave me an uncomfortable feeling of things beyond\nthe ken of men as I looked at her through the port. I would never know\nwhat killed her, or where she was going, or whence she came. Yet she\nwas mine. It made me feel like an upstart. And it made me afraid ...\nbut of what?\n  \n \n  We should have reported her to the nearest EMV base, but that would\nhave meant that we'd lose her. Scientists would be sent out. Men better\nequipped than we to investigate the first extrasolar artifact found by\nmen. But I didn't report her. She was ours. She was money in the bank.\nLet the scientists take over after we'd put a prize crew aboard and\nbrought her into Callisto for salvage.... That's the way I had things\nfigured.\n  \n \n  The Maid hove to about a hundred yards from her and hung there, dwarfed\nby the mighty glistening ship. I called for volunteers and we prepared\na boarding party. I was thinking that her drives alone would be worth\nmillions. Cohn took charge and he and three of the men suited up and\ncrossed to her.\n  \n \n  In an hour they were back, disappointment largely written on their\nfaces.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing left of her, Captain,\" Cohn reported, \"Whatever hit\nher tore up the innards so badly we couldn't even find the drives.\nShe's a mess inside. Nothing left but the hull and a few storage\ncompartments that are still unbroken.\"\n  \n \n  She was never built to carry humanoids he told us, and there was\nnothing that could give us a hint of where she had come from. The hull\nalone was left.\n  \n \n  He dropped two chunks of metal on my desk. \"I brought back some samples\nof her pressure hull,\" he said, \"The whole thing is made of this\nstuff....\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll still take her in,\" I said, hiding my disappointment. \"The\ncarcass will be worth money in Callisto. Have Mister Marvin and\nZaleski assemble a spare pulse-jet. We'll jury-rig her and bring her\ndown under her own power. You take charge of provisioning her. Check\nthose compartments you found and install oxy-generators aboard. When\nit's done report to me in my quarters.\"\n  \n \n  I picked up the two samples of gleaming metal and called for a\nmetallurgical testing kit. \"I'm going to try and find out if this stuff\nis worth anything....\"\n  \n \n  The metal was heavy\u2014too heavy, it seemed to me, for spaceship\nconstruction. But then, who was to say what conditions existed on that\ndistant world where this metal was made?\n  \n \n  Under the bright fluorescent over my work-table, the chunks of metal\ntorn from a random bulkhead of the starship gleamed like pale silver;\nthose strange little whorls that I had noticed on the outer hull were\nthere too, like tiny magnetic lines of force, making the surface of\nthe metal seem to dance. I held the stuff in my bare hand.\n   \n   It had a\nyellowish tinge, and it was heavier\n   \n  ....\n  \n \n  Even as I watched, the metal grew yellower, and the hand that held\nit grew bone weary, little tongues of fatigue licking up my forearm.\nSuddenly terrified, I dropped the chunk as though it were white hot. It\nstruck the table with a dull thud and lay there, a rich yellow lump of\nmetallic lustre.\n  \n \n  For a long while I just sat and stared. Then I began testing, trying\nall the while to quiet the trembling of my hands. I weighed it on a\nbalance. I tested it with acids. It had changed unquestionably. It\nwas no longer the same as when I had carried it into my quarters. The\nwhorls of force were gone. It was no longer alive with a questing\nvibrancy ... it was inert, stable. From somewhere, somehow, it had\ndrawn the energy necessary for transmutation. The unknown metal\u2014the\nstuff of which that whole mammoth spaceship from the stars was\nbuilt\u2014was now....\n  \n \n \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I scarcely dared believe it, but there it was staring at me from my\ntable-top.\n   \n   Gold!\n   \n \n \n  I searched my mind for an explanation. Contra-terrene matter, perhaps,\nfrom some distant island universe where matter reacted differently ...\ndrawing energy from somewhere, the energy it needed to find stability\nin its new environment. Stability as a terrene element\u2014wonderfully,\nmiraculously gold!\n  \n \n  And outside, in the void beyond the Maid's ports there were tons of\nthis metal that could be turned into treasure. My laughter must have\nbeen a wild sound in those moments of discovery....\n  \n<doc-sep>On Callisto I was relieved of my command. The Admiralty Court acquitted\nme of the charges of negligence, but the Foundation refused me another\nship. It was my ... illness. It spread from my hands, as you can see.\nSlowly, very slowly. So what remains for me? A hospital cot and a\nspaceman's pension. Those tons of gold in the sky are cursed, like most\ngreat treasures. Somewhere, out in the deeps between the stars, the\ndust of my crew guards that golden derelict. It belongs to them now ...\nall of it.\n  \n \n  But the price we pay for treasure is this. Look at me. I look eighty!\nI'm thirty two. And the bitterest part of the story is that people\nlaugh at me when I tell what happened. They laugh and call me my\nnickname. Have you heard it?\n  \n \n  It's ... Captain Midas.\n  \n \n"
