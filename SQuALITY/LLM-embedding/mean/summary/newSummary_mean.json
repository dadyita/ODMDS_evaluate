    "The story of \"Cultural Exchange\" revolves around a man named Retief who works for the Culture Division. He is approached by a farmer named Hank Arapoulous from Lovenbroy, who is facing a problem with their upcoming wine harvest. The wine crop is about to be ready, but they are short-handed and need extra workers to pick the grapes. Arapoulous asks Retief if the Culture Division can provide a loan to hire extra hands for the harvest.\n\nRetief is unable to help directly as the Culture Division is not involved in providing labor, but he suggests that Arapoulous check with the Labor Office. However, it turns out that the Labor Office does not consider field work as their responsibility and refuses to provide the needed labor. Arapoulous is worried because if they don't have a successful harvest, they will not be able to repay their loan to Croanie, a world that holds a mortgage on their grape acreage.\n\nMeanwhile, Retief is also involved in the exchange program with Bogan, a troubled world known for its aggressive behavior. Two thousand Bogan students are being sent to d'Land, an industrial world, for cultural exchange. However, Retief discovers that d'Land only has a small technical college and does not have the capacity to accommodate such a large number of students. He also learns that Croanie, a world indebted to Bogan, is receiving heavy mining equipment under the MEDDLE program, while d'Land, in need of mining equipment, is left without any assistance.\n\nRetief realizes that there is a connection between the situations on Lovenbroy, Bogan, Croanie, and d'Land. He suspects that there may be some kind of manipulation or mishandling of resources and assistance by the various divisions of the Corps. He tries to gather more information and confronts his colleague, Mr. Whaffle, about the tractors being sent to Croanie. However, Whaffle dismisses his concerns and refuses to provide any information.\n\nIn the end, the story leaves the readers with the realization that there may be corrupt practices or mismanagement within the Corps, and Retief's suspicions about the connections between the different worlds and their needs are not fully resolved. The story highlights the complexities and challenges of cultural exchange and the potential for exploitation or manipulation of resources in such programs.",

The purpose of the program is to sublimate the Bogan students' aggressions into more cultivated channels and encourage their participation in the cultural life of the Galaxy. However, it is revealed that d'Land is an industrial world with a technical college that is not well-equipped to handle the influx of two thousand students. It is also mentioned that d'Land is in need of tractors, which are being sent to Croanie, a world that holds a mortgage on Lovenbroy's grape acreage.

The Bacchus vines they grow only mature every twelve years, and this year is Wine Year. However, they are in need of more harvest hands to pick the grapes. Arapoulous seeks help from Retief to find workers for the harvest.\n\nRetief agrees to help and contacts the Port Authority to inquire about a group of Bogan students who are traveling aboard two CDT transports. He discovers that their baggage has been mistakenly consigned to Lovenbroy instead of d'Land, their intended destination.

However, Retief manages to convince Gulver that everything is under control and that the students will still be going to Lovenbroy.\n\nIn the end, the Bogan students arrive on Lovenbroy and join in the grape harvest, bringing much-needed labor to the farms.

    "The premise of the story \"Big Ancestor\" revolves around the concept that there are at least a hundred different kinds of humans, each originating on different planets in strict seclusion. However, despite the lack of contact throughout the ages before space travel, each planetary race can interbreed with a minimum of ten others. This leads the characters in the story to believe that there must have been a common ancestor that distributed the human species across different planets. They speculate that this ancestor was a highly advanced race of biologists who modified themselves and produced humans.\n\nThe possibility of mating with different species on the spectrum is discussed in relation to the adjacency mating principle. The theory suggests that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close. By arranging a list of all human races in sequence, researchers can determine which races can interbreed based on their positions in the sequence. This implies that races that are adjacent to each other in the sequence have a higher chance of being able to mate and produce fertile offspring.\n\nThe characters in the story discuss the implications of this theory and the potential benefits of discovering the unknown ancestor. They mention the satisfaction of knowing where humans came from and the cultural discoveries that could be made by studying their ancestors' advanced civilization.

However, his plan is foiled when the girl reveals that she is a sergeant in the Women's Self-Defense Association (WSDA), a branch of the CPA, and she easily defends herself against Joe's attempted assault. Joe realizes that his plan to commit a crime and become an Ex is not as foolproof as he thought.",
    "In the crime story \"PICK A CRIME,\" the consequences of having a DCT (Dangerous Criminal Tendencies) designation are explored. In this society, the CPA (Crime Prevention Association) has made crime almost impossible through various crime-prevention devices and methods. Criminals are not punished but instead sent to hospitals where their criminal tendencies are removed. Once they receive the treatment, they are considered Exes and are trusted with responsibilities and offered the best jobs.\n\nHowever, being a DCT carries significant repercussions. When Joe, the protagonist, reveals his DCT status to a girl, he explains that having this designation makes it nearly impossible to get a good job. Employers can request to see a person's CPA ID before considering them for a position, and if it states that they are a DCT, they are often denied employment. Joe recounts the menial jobs he has had to take as a DCT, such as being a garbage man, street-cleaner, and ditch-digger.\n\nFurthermore, being a DCT First Class brings additional challenges. Hendricks, a CPA official, explains that Joe's case history will be turned over to the newspapers, making him the subject of public scrutiny and the hobby of amateur cops. People will follow him, watch him, and hope to catch him in the act of committing a crime. Joe realizes that his every move will be monitored, from his neighbors watching him through binoculars to strangers following him on the street. The constant surveillance and the inability to commit even the smallest crime without severe consequences make life as a DCT First Class extremely difficult.\n\nDespite the restrictions placed on DCTs, Joe hatches a plan to commit a crime to improve his chances of getting a good job. He enlists the help of a girl, but their plan is thwarted when Hendricks, who had been listening to their conversation, takes Joe's CPA ID card and upgrades his DCT designation to First Class. Hendricks warns Joe about the repercussions of his actions, emphasizing the constant surveillance and public attention he will face as a DCT First Class.\n\nIn this society, the CPA's crime prevention methods are pervasive, with hidden microphones, television cameras, and devices that can detect weapons or counterfeit money. The constant reminders that \"Crime is Filth\" through subliminal messages and the active involvement of citizens in crime prevention contribute to a society where crime is virtually nonexistent. However, the consequences for those labeled as DCTs are severe, with limited job prospects and constant scrutiny.\n\nJoe's frustration with his DCT designation and his desire to commit a crime highlights the limitations and unintended consequences of the CPA system. While it has succeeded in reducing crime, it has also created a society where individuals like Joe are stigmatized and restricted in their opportunities. The story raises questions about the ethics and effectiveness of a system that prioritizes crime prevention over individual freedom and rehabilitation.",

In the end, the crew contemplates their choices and the impact of their actions on the planet and its inhabitants.",
    "The initial location of the story \"Orphans of the Void\" is on the dead fourth planet of a star called Tyban, in the region of the Coal Sack Nebula. Captain Steffens of the Mapping Command and Lieutenant Ball are exploring a temporary camp on this planet, which appears to be built out of native materials. They discover buildings that are incredibly old, possibly several thousand years old, and are evidence of an advanced, space-crossing, alien race.

    "In the story \"Orphans of the Void\" by Michael Shaara, there is an ironic parallel between the Makers and humans. The Makers are a highly advanced alien race that built the robots who serve them. The robots, known as the Orphans, believe that the Makers will return and they exist solely to serve them. However, it is revealed that the Makers have been gone for a very long time and will not be returning. This realization creates a sense of loss and disappointment for the robots, as their purpose and belief system are shattered. \n\nThis parallel can be seen in the humans' relationship with their own belief systems and faith. Just like the robots, humans often have beliefs and faith in something greater than themselves, whether it be religion, ideology, or even personal goals. These beliefs give humans a sense of purpose and guide their actions. However, there may come a time when these beliefs are challenged or proven to be false, just as the robots' belief in the return of the Makers is shattered. This can lead to a similar sense of loss and disappointment for humans, as they question the meaning and purpose of their lives. \n\nThe irony lies in the fact that both the robots and humans have placed their faith and belief in something outside of themselves, only to have those beliefs proven false. The parallel serves as a reminder of the human condition, the need for purpose and belief, and the potential for disappointment when those beliefs are shattered. It highlights the importance of finding a cause worth living for, rather than just one worth dying for, as the universe is full of causes but finding one that truly gives meaning to life is the genuine problem.",

    "In the story \"The Desert and the Stars,\" the history of Flamme plays a significant role in its settlement. Sixty years ago, the Corps encouraged the Boyars to settle Flamme as a foothold against Neo-Concordiatist elements. The Boyars spent the next six decades terraforming the planet, clearing jungle, descumming the seas, irrigating deserts, and setting out forests. They have almost reached the point where they can begin to enjoy the fruits of their labor. However, the Aga Kagans, another group of settlers, have now moved in and are claiming land on Flamme. The Boyars, feeling threatened, want the Corps to support them and help them hold onto their homes. The Under-Secretary, however, is hesitant to take any action and suggests a diplomatic approach. Retief, the protagonist, argues for more concrete support from the Corps, fearing that without it, there will be a violent conflict between the Boyars and the Aga Kagans. Eventually, the Under-Secretary agrees to send a Note to the Aga Kagans, but no further action is promised. Retief, disillusioned with diplomatic talk, decides to return to Flamme and try to keep the peace, even if it means starting a war.",
    "In the story \"The Desert and the Stars\" by Keith Laumer, the Aga Kagans are a group of people who are actively engaged in land-grabbing on the planet Flamme. They have been building up their forces for the past five years and have now landed detachments of \"fishermen\" and \"homesteaders\" armed with modern weapons. They are tough and ruthless, and their goal is to take over the land that the Boyars, who have spent years terraforming Flamme, have made habitable.\n\nThe Aga Kagans operate by using a combination of deception and force. They present themselves as simple goat-herders, living in goat-skin tents and riding animals, but in reality, they have a modern navy and access to advanced technology. They masquerade as primitive to hide their true intentions and capabilities. They also have a well-organized and well-equipped military force that allows them to take control of the land they desire.\n\nIn the story, Retief, a diplomat representing the Boyars, tries to negotiate with the Aga Kagans to prevent them from taking over Flamme. However, the Aga Kagans are confident in their ability to succeed and believe that the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne (CDT) will not intervene. They see themselves as the rightful owners of the land and are determined to achieve their goals.\n\nThe significance of the Aga Kagans lies in their aggressive actions and their disregard for the rights and efforts of the Boyars. They represent a threat to the stability and peace of Flamme, and their presence highlights the challenges faced by the Boyars in defending their territory. The story raises questions about the role of diplomacy, the use of force, and the responsibility of the CDT in resolving conflicts between different factions.",
